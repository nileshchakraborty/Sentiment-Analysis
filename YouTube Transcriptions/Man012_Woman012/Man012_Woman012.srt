1
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:35,980
what's the most fun you've ever had with

2
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:39,130
me and why I think on Halloween when we

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:45,640
went to the stacks and it was just like

4
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:47,290
I was so drunk but I was so I don't

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,320
think I hadn't known you that long

6
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,570
I mean I'd known you but I think it was

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,790
the first time I felt like I could just

8
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,180
like be crazy around you because I had

9
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,710
felt so subdued around you before and I

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,460
even said something like I don't feel

11
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,600
like I've shown you everything at this

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,880
point I think I said something before

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,860
Halloween happened and then it started

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,570
ringing and we ran around in the rain

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:17,880
and we had like kissing in the rain and

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:17,880
dancing yeah it was pouring so much fun

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:32,920
what's your first impression of me um my

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:35,350
first impression of you hmm I don't know

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,299
you're really sweet I thought you were

20
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,670
very courteous because you laughed at

21
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:45,759
all my really bad jokes and that was

22
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:49,659
really nice cuz I was really nervous yes

23
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:54,939
when I first met you and and yeah that

24
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:58,289
just made me feel comfortable yeah I

25
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,789
don't know your s just somebody who

26
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:03,729
there's somebody who could be a friend I

27
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:08,490
guess a friend

28
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:11,650
yeah just like because you were just so

29
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,530
genuine I think I think genuine is a

30
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:19,500
good word you know I didn't feel like

31
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:21,850
you were trying to be somebody else yes

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:31,720
cool that make sense

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:35,740
yeah what's the most ridiculous thing

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:39,820
I've done what did it teach you about me

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,980
okay well we went to see after we went

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,400
to see that opera show that I didn't

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,080
like and you liked and first of all

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,290
you're seeing opera in the car

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,500
and then that was ridiculous but we went

40
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,670
to get fun and you got up in the middle

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,100
of the restaurant and because we were

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,090
having a conversation about how I can't

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,040
like my memory is pretty bad and you're

44
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,220
like well you should like make things

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,480
more memorable like you should I don't

46
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,490
know I don't I don't know what you were

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,190
trying to do but you got up and started

48
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,120
dancing but it looked like flailing to

49
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:20,130
me and everybody was like looking and it

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:25,630
was it was absolutely ridiculous I don't

51
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:27,460
remembered it I remembered it although

52
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,610
there was at one time in the car you

53
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:33,780
couldn't oh yeah no there was that

54
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,780
moment you didn't like that

55
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,280
well I feel like I failed oh no I knew

56
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:55,600
when do you feel closest to me um I

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:57,010
think I feel closest to you when well go

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,420
with the more obvious answer and then

59
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,270
I'll try to think of something more

60
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,750
interesting when we're like in bed

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,320
together

62
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,540
and our faces are like so close together

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,340
that we can't even focus our eyes but we

64
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,590
just like stay that way anyways I think

65
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,540
I don't know I'm just just something

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,630
about being our faces being that close

67
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:28,720
together it's like it's really special

68
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:31,249
and nice or when we're dancing yeah yeah

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,889
I just that's really nice and

70
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:35,889
I think those moments are really special

71
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:51,529
it's my dream two-part question

72
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:58,429
what do I do that turns you on and when

73
00:04:51,529 --> 00:05:01,909
do you feel most sexy with me okay you

74
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:04,399
do a lot of silly things without weirdly

75
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:06,499
turn me on like when you speak in that

76
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,479
southern accent that's so southern that

77
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:10,699
you can't really distinguish what you're

78
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,829
saying it's I don't know why it's so

79
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,179
sexy to me it's like so it's just maybe

80
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:16,909
the fact that you can just make fun of

81
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:22,659
yourself and be silly like that boy yeah

82
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:33,799
yeah it's a Texan in music yeah and I

83
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:38,349
feel most sexy when you tell me I am

84
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:38,349
that's what I feel most sexy really yeah

85
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:53,949
if you could wish one thing for me what

86
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:58,149
would it be and why um I would wish that

87
00:05:53,949 --> 00:06:01,339
that you find like the the thing that

88
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:03,949
gives you like a lot of fulfillment

89
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:07,809
you know because you will you know move

90
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:09,949
to New York to be on Broadway and then

91
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:13,459
realize you didn't want to be on

92
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:15,439
Broadway and and I think now that now

93
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:18,499
you're like in school and trying to

94
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,059
figure out what it is you know and it

95
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:24,349
doesn't have to be professionally you

96
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:28,039
know but just just something that like

97
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:30,379
really gives you fulfillment yeah

98
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,949
something that you love to do and you

99
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,949
can do everyday

100
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,590
okay breathe breathing through them

101
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,150
what are you hesitant to tell me

102
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,170
[Music]

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:24,520
oh I wrote it actually in one of the

104
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,170
letters I gave you for Valentine's Day

105
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,710
that you and you haven't opened yet

106
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,500
obviously

107
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:40,420
mm-hmm as a kind of like as an incentive

108
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:48,180
for me to tell you because I want to but

109
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:48,180
I don't want you to feel like it's

110
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,970
pressure or like you have to say

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:08:03,180
something to me

112
00:07:51,970 --> 00:08:03,180
in return but I think that I've never I

113
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:12,460
think you know what I'm trying to say I

114
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:16,980
don't you know I think you know I don't

115
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,980
want to say it but if you know because

116
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:24,460
I'm really scared to say this okay and

117
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:31,270
you know what I'm okay

118
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:40,479
yeah and yeah I am too mmm and I think

119
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:43,210
that yeah I don't I've never I've never

120
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,620
told any of my partners people that have

121
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:49,750
had a relationship with and yeah I've

122
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:55,839
never told told anyone that I've that I

123
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:57,880
love them and in some ways that like was

124
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:05,040
a big reason why my last relationship

125
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:07,480
ended and yeah I think that that's

126
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,310
that's just something like there's

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,020
something to that word when in in like

128
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:19,510
that context that has so much weight for

129
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:23,440
me yeah and and it's such a special

130
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:25,730
thing so I very like I think I'm very

131
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,699
sensitive and very cautious

132
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,740
with how I use it but I also think that

133
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm probably too cautious because I

134
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,690
don't know like when you care about

135
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:45,680
somebody and and they're an important

136
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:48,050
part of your life and then like they

137
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,070
deserve that you know they deserve to be

138
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,300
told that and yeah I think it just has

139
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:58,250
something to do with maybe the way I was

140
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:02,240
raised you know like in a very sort of

141
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:08,120
conservative family who I think they

142
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:15,769
play like a lot of emphasis on love and

143
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:22,720
romance that's like very serious and but

144
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:27,649
I don't know like it's I think it's

145
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:31,579
something that's everyone's very strange

146
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:32,959
for me you you think you've never been

147
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:39,410
in love before or you know you haven't

148
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:40,760
never been no I don't know I think I

149
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,440
think and I think in a lot of ways I

150
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,420
have you know and I think that I

151
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,850
experience different kinds of love yeah

152
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:51,649
you know you know obviously like love

153
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,839
for your friends I think is very

154
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,970
different yeah can I say I love you to

155
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,220
my friends all the time yeah but I think

156
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,699
there's something like with them yeah

157
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:07,790
there's more there's more wait yeah but

158
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:09,529
I know what do you I just think like I'm

159
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,730
just so hesitant because it's only been

160
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:15,920
I've only known you for six months maybe

161
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,800
a little more than that and it's weird

162
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,819
for me because I'm like I don't this

163
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,800
doesn't happen to me very easily that I

164
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:32,740
even like someone really like and want

165
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:35,959
to go past like four days and I just

166
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,899
maybe it's not and maybe it's not love

167
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,310
like yet or whatever but I just it's

168
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,870
something that I'm feeling that I

169
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,449
haven't like it's just an intense

170
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,640
feeling that I have and that's the what

171
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:49,760
comes to my tongue when I see you when I

172
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,260
say goodbye to you when I like I don't

173
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,660
know when we're laying in bed next to

174
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,519
each other like it comes to my like it

175
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,569
comes to the back of my teeth

176
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,920
and then don't say it because I don't

177
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,839
know it's the same thing for me I'm

178
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,880
hesitant it makes it's very important to

179
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,019
me that I mean it and it's very

180
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,180
important to me that the person who says

181
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:11,029
it to me means it and I think that's why

182
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,360
I haven't said it to you because I know

183
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:16,279
like I feel so strongly like I mean it

184
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,870
but I just want to be sure but I don't

185
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,470
know if like you're saying like how do

186
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:24,199
you really how can you be like so sure

187
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:27,560
so positive I want to be so positive and

188
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:30,439
I think really what I need to be

189
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:34,850
positive about it is to know that it's

190
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:37,459
reciprocated but I don't that's why I

191
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,310
preface this by saying I don't want the

192
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:46,880
pressure you know

193
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:49,910
so it's looming you know no I believe

194
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:57,560
like I've definitely it's it's been

195
00:12:49,910 --> 00:13:01,910
there for me too and yeah I guess I just

196
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:06,800
don't know it's just really hard I think

197
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:09,230
for me cuz I don't know I just don't

198
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,019
know where like I stand and it's sort of

199
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,519
my I don't know I just feel like there's

200
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:14,990
so much and I feel like we still are

201
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,399
like a really it's a really new

202
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:23,480
relationship and and I still feel like I

203
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,740
have so much to learn but like I'm I

204
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,160
don't know what I want to do with my

205
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,420
life

206
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,569
like I don't I just feel almost stupid

207
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:36,260
like feeling the way that I'm feeling

208
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:40,790
because it's like so far past where I

209
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:42,120
feel like I should be yeah I don't want

210
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,279
to talk about this anymore

211
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,860
yeah I mean I let's do something to say

212
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,709
yeah I just I don't know I feel like so

213
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,889
much of my life has been just being

214
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:56,819
hesitant or nervous about saying that to

215
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:58,620
somebody else and part of me I'm just

216
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:00,149
torn because part of me feels like that

217
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,850
like yes you should hold that word too

218
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:06,720
like there that phrase to the highest

219
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:09,360
standard and like and and I think I do

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,329
like I but then part of me feels like

221
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,089
you know like you know you should just

222
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:17,009
let your heart be open to whatever you

223
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:20,550
know and not think so much I think I

224
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:22,589
just think too much about it and about

225
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,339
everything I could just just churning

226
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,189
all the time and and I don't know so I

227
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,189
just yeah I just I'm like constantly in

228
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,269
this back and forth I'm just like no bu

229
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:36,360
like you really care about this person

230
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:38,279
like show you know show that through

231
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,870
words you know like you can do that and

232
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:48,019
then and then part of me feels like you

233
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:53,370
just don't rush into anything whatever

234
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:55,740
it's like it's weird because I get a lot

235
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,029
of pressure from this is so weird this

236
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,899
is such a weird kind of pressure to put

237
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:02,809
on somebody but from Jordan because when

238
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,790
he met you and then he saw us together

239
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:07,290
he was like oh my god you're in love

240
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,699
with him you're so in love with it I

241
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,249
mean he's so in love with you and I was

242
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,800
just like shut up shut up because like I

243
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,990
had already been thinking about it and

244
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,199
for somebody on the outside to say that

245
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,850
they saw something like that was I don't

246
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,269
know kind of pushed me forward a little

247
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,050
bit maybe I shouldn't have let it but

248
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:34,840
you know I really I trust him and he

249
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:37,900
knows me very well so I don't know okay

250
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm gonna ask you a question oh okay

251
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:47,350
yeah okay what do you think is the

252
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,350
biggest challenge to our relationship

253
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:57,050
well I think well I think this is one

254
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:59,080
yeah yeah just kind of trying to

255
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,300
understand where we're both at you know

256
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:07,850
romantic feelings towards each other you

257
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:09,170
know like and they're just just cuz I

258
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,240
know we both care about each other

259
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,940
deeply you know but just I don't know I

260
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,440
guess they look like yeah the love thing

261
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,240
like trying to figure it out

262
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,470
I don't know I think I have

263
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,200
apprehensions about it and I think

264
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:25,670
that's a challenge and then just I mean

265
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,240
you know we've talked about it

266
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:32,090
I don't know where I'm gonna be in you

267
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,270
know a month or two months or a year or

268
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:39,500
whatever and you you could be moving to

269
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:48,260
the bay and you know a couple months you

270
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:50,540
know which is a challenge I think just

271
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:53,810
because you know who knows what's gonna

272
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,790
happen but I feel like I don't I feel

273
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,280
like we're in a good place I feel like

274
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:02,390
we're both we're both enjoying the

275
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,010
moment in a lot of ways like just that's

276
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,190
another reason I don't want to say like

277
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,870
I didn't want to say that because I just

278
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,270
want to enjoy it with you because I

279
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,410
don't know where you know I don't know

280
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,209
where I'm gonna go just go on I don't

281
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,890
know if I'm gonna move and you don't

282
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,260
know where you're gonna be and it's like

283
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,260
I just want to enjoy it and I don't want

284
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,920
that but I also just want you to know

285
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:33,080
like I want you to know so bad well now

286
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:35,120
I do know you know I think about it

287
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,900
that's how you know yeah and I do too

288
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:44,620
okay

289
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:47,880
and yeah I don't know like when it's but

290
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,880
I care about you deeply

291
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:03,750
and you know like I do love you

292
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,120
are you just saying now no I don't think

293
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,890
so I think but I mean I'm saying that

294
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:14,640
with maybe the just like I don't really

295
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:17,520
know what that means fully but but if

296
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,470
I'm gonna like define it for me right

297
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,630
now in my life which is like you have

298
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,100
somebody that you care about that you

299
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,140
enjoy spending time with that you feel

300
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:36,390
like you're learning from and growing

301
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:39,299
with then then yeah I do you know yeah

302
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,460
and but I don't I mean to be honest I

303
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:46,860
don't know like how that can change or

304
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:48,330
what's gonna happen but I think part of

305
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,980
what I like about us is that we just

306
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,980
kind of go with it you know like we

307
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,070
don't really know and I think we should

308
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,280
just keep doing that and then like they

309
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,380
said that but I don't want you to think

310
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,440
that now I expect I'm saying it to me it

311
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,030
was not guilty no I know I know I don't

312
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,070
think that you would say it if you

313
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,679
didn't want to say it but I also don't

314
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,990
want you to feel like you know now it's

315
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,120
a thing that we have said I hate that

316
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:19,350
it's like a milestone okay you know wow

317
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,809
I feel good yeah yeah cool okay I feel

318
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:29,940
good

319
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:31,530
okay no it's yours oh it's mine yeah mmm

320
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:47,730
am I the best sex you've ever had

321
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:49,049
yes you are mine very much so what do

322
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:56,340
you think is the hardest thing for me

323
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:59,669
right now the hardest thing for you yeah

324
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,380
I mean I guess and maybe you can say

325
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:05,429
what you think but I've just that kind

326
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:09,360
of figuring out yeah school major career

327
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:10,419
life you know where you gonna live yes

328
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:21,789
everything

329
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:24,989
yeah you think that's you got it what

330
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,989
can I do to improve our relationship

331
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:37,090
nothing I want you to do what you do

332
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:40,899
because I want to look good no I just

333
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,159
want to experience it the way that you

334
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:49,629
want it to be you know I like I don't

335
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:51,549
want you to I don't think that I have an

336
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:55,179
answer to that really I don't think that

337
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:58,210
there's anything that I think is not

338
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:00,759
good right now hmm other than like

339
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:04,409
what's gonna happen later but nobody can

340
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:08,769
do anything about that anyway mm-hmm

341
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:12,460
nothing okay wait you have to look at my

342
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,809
eyes right no I answered it all right is

343
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:20,350
it mine no I think it's mine

344
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:23,379
didn't you just yeah yeah that's you

345
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:27,330
do you believe in the one and am i it

346
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:30,309
what makes you believe in the one I

347
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:35,649
don't believe in the one I believe

348
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:39,429
there's so many ones that it all just

349
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:44,559
comes down to circumstances and the

350
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:46,809
right time right place you know if I was

351
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,700
having a really bad day and I felt like

352
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,619
crap and I probably might have had a bad

353
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,029
date and we even never be sitting here

354
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:54,789
you know but I was probably having a

355
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:56,529
pretty good day and I was excited and I

356
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:58,690
don't know it's great to meet you and

357
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:09,129
everything was great

358
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:17,220
and then so I mean yeah I don't know I

359
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:20,220
guess that's right yeah

360
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:32,640
then there's only one yeah and also

361
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:47,030
statistically very yeah when do you

362
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:47,030
think I take you for granted and why I

363
00:22:50,360 --> 00:23:00,090
don't think I just simply do not think

364
00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:04,380
that like I hate that I'm like you're a

365
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:08,520
great--you're I don't know like I hurt

366
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:16,770
yeah right trust me I want to answer

367
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:18,960
that but I don't maybe when I like make

368
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,760
a plan like that I'm excited about we

369
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,799
talked about this recently when I make a

370
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,870
plan that I'm excited about you know and

371
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:31,260
you kind of just want to invite people

372
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,820
but it's just out of like oh I missed

373
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,830
that dude Michael like let's invite him

374
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,210
- Oh what miss Ben was inviting it's

375
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,440
like you just want you just love

376
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,390
everyone and you just want to hang out

377
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,059
with everyone at the same time but

378
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,220
sometimes I just want like time with you

379
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,860
but I don't know that that's necessarily

380
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,820
taken but your deaths you've taken me

381
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,429
for granted

382
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,880
maybe it's just like not recognizing

383
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,880
what I want

384
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:09,840
what do you wish I did differently you

385
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,779
know something I just had a conversation

386
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:17,639
with a friend recently we were talking

387
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:21,029
about you know texting verse calling and

388
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,980
I feel like we text a lot more than we

389
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:26,940
talk to each other in the phone yeah I

390
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:31,559
hate that so I guess yeah it'd be nice

391
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,659
if unless it's you know you know making

392
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,220
plans or like meet up here or here's the

393
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,489
address you know it'd be nice just to

394
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:42,539
talk and hear your voice and yeah

395
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:43,799
instead of texting I feel like I feel

396
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:49,139
like a relationships maybe a little too

397
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:53,039
text heavy yeah but you've actually

398
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:58,259
tried to do recently I noticed that yeah

399
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,970
I don't like just texting anyway yeah

400
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,590
yeah you're always like throwing your

401
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:13,889
phone can't do this right now

402
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:15,989
yeah that's good what do you think is

403
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:19,519
the most important lesson I'm learning

404
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:19,519
at this stage in my life

405
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:44,350
what yep living I think something over

406
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:44,350
here here okay okay I think

407
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,240
maybe this is like I'm going to twist

408
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:03,800
this a little bit I think maybe this is

409
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:09,410
just how I see you but I sometimes just

410
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:13,520
think that you aren't realistic about

411
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,500
things like just it's the simplest thing

412
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,790
that you're just not realistic about

413
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,100
like when you told me about three

414
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,080
bottles of honey this is tiny but I was

415
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,480
like why do you really bought three

416
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:32,210
bottles just so many that's just a small

417
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,340
example but like in the giant bag of

418
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:47,500
can't like I don't know you can all

419
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:51,200
before it goes bad okay for myself okay

420
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,330
I don't know it's like like I just think

421
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,580
they're sweet so it's how is it the most

422
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:59,360
important lesson well I'm getting OH

423
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,490
so but I think like sometimes I'll seeds

424
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,960
like take a step back I just wish I had

425
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,750
a better example than pickles on honey

426
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,390
but you know you like it a step back and

427
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,160
you like Oh Bobby that was like oh I

428
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,290
should have thought about that or

429
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,420
whatever I just think like there are

430
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,490
some circumstances especially for me

431
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,810
because I'm a planner when it comes to

432
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:23,000
planning you know like but I think that

433
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:26,540
I always see you do that and I always

434
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,310
want to just be like what why though

435
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,260
like what it was like didn't you think

436
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,720
about just because that's the way that I

437
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,150
think like I just plan and you I don't

438
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,980
think you really plan that much I don't

439
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:41,660
know but I think I always see like you

440
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:52,700
know the calculation right in your head

441
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:54,170
like another example because I see I see

442
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,160
buying three jars of honey is like

443
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:59,920
planning for the future I'm always gonna

444
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,660
go bad but the kale I was just like

445
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:10,330
a lot it's for lunches at work okay

446
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:11,890
see Wow okay that's fine no oh no I I

447
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:15,060
think I know which we how about when we

448
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:18,190
went hiking with my brother Drake and

449
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:21,160
you were like and we were all so dirty

450
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:25,510
and sweaty and covered in sunscreen and

451
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:28,600
you were like oh let's go visit Jacob

452
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,790
and his house if he's here and I was

453
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,860
just like I'm so tired

454
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,750
like I know do you really want to go to

455
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,320
sit in someone's living room right now

456
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:43,270
with my brother who's 18 like I don't

457
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,980
know okay yeah I twisted that a little

458
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:55,270
bit maybe it's not a lesson movie it's

459
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:57,550
just something that I want to just why

460
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,820
haven't you given up on our relationship

461
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:07,420
Oh cuz I like you and I like spending

462
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:08,500
time with you and and it's like I don't

463
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,840
know I think like you're a really

464
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,140
wonderful person and I feel like I'm

465
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:23,200
learning a lot like how my lack of

466
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:26,770
planning yeah and it's just it's just

467
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,070
nice to have you around and to hold you

468
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,070
and

469
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:44,859
yeah well yeah like I don't know that

470
00:29:42,789 --> 00:30:02,499
the idea giving up on the relationship

471
00:29:44,859 --> 00:30:04,419
they did seem so far from how has your

472
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:08,229
parents relationship influenced our

473
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:11,229
relationship I just think a lot of

474
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:13,960
people think that my like having

475
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:15,999
divorced parents is like the worst thing

476
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,710
ever but for me I think it happened at a

477
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:19,179
time where I could understand it because

478
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,029
I was a senior in high school and I'm

479
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:25,330
you know I it was miserable to be in a

480
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:26,529
house with them and okay I can answer

481
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,169
this it was miserable

482
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:30,429
to be in a house with them because they

483
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,899
were always yelling and fighting and it

484
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,179
was one parent against the other and

485
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:38,349
like that there was just no cohesiveness

486
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:42,059
and the house at all and when they moved

487
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:46,509
out they became great friends and I

488
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:50,559
think it just showed me what I what I

489
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:52,960
don't want that like you can have like

490
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,929
you can find a partner that you're great

491
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,669
friends with but that's not like enough

492
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,720
you have to kind of just be on the same

493
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:59,739
same wavelength

494
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,379
and I just want to be on the same

495
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:05,409
wavelength as somebody I want them to

496
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:08,109
you know obviously that does it that

497
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:10,359
means like we can have different

498
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:14,529
opinions we can fight and we can you

499
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:15,999
know but I just at the core of their

500
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:19,090
beings my parents are different people

501
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:27,789
and I just want to have some more

502
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:30,369
similarity than that but that's I don't

503
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:31,809
like they haven't like damaged me or

504
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:34,599
anything like that I've been divorced I

505
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:39,009
actually think they it's been great for

506
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:41,580
everyone in the family divorced the

507
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:41,580
hosta home

508
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,820
what is one sexual fantasy you would

509
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:58,000
like to have oh my gosh

510
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,000
just one

511
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,210
well definitely the airplane yeah thing

512
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,600
yeah I always want every time I'm on an

513
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,280
airplane

514
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,040
people are gonna steal two people go in

515
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,500
there oh yeah oh no oh and the flight

516
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:16,250
attendants yeah oh yeah

517
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,060
no no idea I don't know yeah that's a

518
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:22,060
very huge plane

519
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:25,310
yeah thanks Gare buses but uh let's

520
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,790
that's like too easy let me think of a

521
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,790
different way okay

522
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,109
[Music]

523
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:46,279
I don't know I just I think I think just

524
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:47,899
I guess just interesting places like I

525
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:52,929
like the letter that you wrote me which

526
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:52,929
is just all the places that we could

527
00:32:54,579 --> 00:33:09,459
yeah I guess just different places what

528
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:23,929
would you change in me in you in reality

529
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:29,949
to make this work I was all sort of

530
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:34,809
myself sure I would change my skepticism

531
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:40,659
about it being able to work and I would

532
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:44,289
stop thinking so much it was like

533
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:46,669
thinking planning what's gonna happen is

534
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:49,329
and I think I would also change that in

535
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:58,389
you because I think you do that too and

536
00:33:49,329 --> 00:34:06,229
I think it's like it could ultimately be

537
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:15,470
like a hindrance in continuing in

538
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:17,659
reality I would move the Bay Area down

539
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,909
just like Los Angeles I'm just like cut

540
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,440
it out I was flush lost actually I don't

541
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,779
make Los Angeles and put it up there

542
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,309
it's way better weather okay but that's

543
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:30,079
what I would do I would just put it in

544
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:31,750
the middle of the bay okay yeah and all

545
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:37,160
the San Franciscans would love that

546
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:37,160
[Laughter]

547
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,699

it's like is like I I have no problem

565
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,210
with hanging out there cuz I think she's

566
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,660
really cool but I just don't know her

567
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:06,260

00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:09,360
Sophie okay it's just very dramatic and

for me to like keep up with like yeah

571
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,200

588
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,510
situations at parties with you where I

589
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:19,320
don't know anyone and I want to like try

590
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,920
to talk to people but I just oh you know

591
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,860
what

592
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,390
I you like made it so like you've really

593
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,750
built it up that I was gonna like have

594
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:33,480
this huge connection with Han Solo Hanna

595
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:37,560
oh and like I do I think she's really

596
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:41,040
great but I don't like feel as deeply

597
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,440
yes I think you did like you hoped or

598
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,360
something like she's awesome she is

599
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,160
awesome but we're just very different I

600
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,340
think it's the same thing is this for

601
00:38:47,160 --> 00:39:06,410
you yeah sure very different but she's

602
00:38:50,340 --> 00:39:10,920
cool how many people have you slept with

603
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:14,730
Wow yeah well this is actually the

604
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:18,770
question that I wrote down well I know

605
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:21,090
and I know I said it was evil yeah valid

606
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,730
yeah I wrote it because I was just

607
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:25,020
thinking like what is something that cuz

608
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,490
I was like I feel like we talk about

609
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,040
things a lot and like

610
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,260
I was trying to think of a moment when

611
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:35,369
we didn't like that that stood out that

612
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:38,190
like you know you didn't and I remember

613
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:44,760
that so I was like so I mean you don't

614
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:46,770
have to answer to but yeah it's just I

615
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,540
knew it was more than yours so I just

616
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,480
didn't want like it was so early when

617
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:53,340
you asked me that it was like we were

618
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,450
just getting to know each other and we

619
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:59,220
were like I don't know it was valid we

620
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,869
were like we had slept together so it

621
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:06,990
was a valid question like I think that's

622
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:12,690
okay to ask eight which I don't feel

623
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:14,250
like is a lot but I don't know I just

624
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,170
don't like I don't like to think about

625
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,490
that so I don't like this you know when

626
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:25,110
it's so unimportant to me I don't even

627
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:26,490
like that I know the number yeah even

628
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,840
like really care to know that much oh

629
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,619
that was the only thing that I could

630
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:35,730
think of okay it's eight including you

631
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:47,720
okay what is a secret that you have been

632
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:47,720
too afraid to tell me a secret

633
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,500
secretly I've been too afraid to tell

634
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,500
you

635
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:17,010
gosh I really don't know it's gotta be

636
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:18,840
something what do you do that's like

637
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:26,640
embarrassing you don't want me to know

638
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:32,340
oh all right sure but I've seen I pick

639
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,170
my boogers sometimes you know yeah I

640
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,590
feel like no people caught me made fun

641
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,060
actually

642
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,770
oh my god I wait I have to say something

643
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,810
really right what um when we were saying

644
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,610
in my mom's house oh my god this is

645
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,140
actually I've been wanting to tell you

646
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:47,280
this for so long yeah it was the

647
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,710
opportune moment okay you um I've got a

648
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,570
broom whoa wait I was in the bathroom oh

649
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,130
it's your sick kitchen no it's not no

650
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:55,200
it's all good I was in the bathroom

651
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,630
you're in the kitchen and there's this

652
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,300
window it was dark outside so the window

653
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,460
is like reflective and I was in the

654
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,530
mirror and I thought I had a booger so I

655
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,240
took like a tissue and I stuck it up my

656
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:08,880
nose and I was like moving it around in

657
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,060
there and then I look I just gaze over

658
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,470
in the reflection and you're doing the

659
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,810
exact same thing but you're just using

660
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,520
your finger but we were doing the exact

661
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:26,730
same thing and hiding from each other at

662
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:28,230
the exact oh wow I told like now all

663
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:34,260
your friends know I'm a booger picker

664
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:36,090
and they know what I am too I'll try to

665
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,950
think of something better a better

666
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,750
secret that I oh yeah yeah I think I'm a

667
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:43,980
better secret well I I can't think of

668
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:45,359
anything right now okay I don't think

669
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,310
there's anything like really important

670
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,910
that I haven't told you okay and

671
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:54,530
probably be very little okay but yeah

672
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,530
okay so I guess yeah

673
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,309
okay

674
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:26,050
what would make you leave me just like

675
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:38,330
okay we kind of talked about this before

676
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:42,560
but I was cheated on one time and I

677
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:45,470
didn't really care about the

678
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,200
relationship as like at the time it was

679
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:54,770
like going out it was on its way out and

680
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:57,860
I like it only affected me because of

681
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,750
the thought that I had like done

682
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:03,440
something that would warrant someone to

683
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:09,650
like look elsewhere like but I just

684
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,750
think like I don't know I don't it would

685
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:15,850
depend on what the situation was but I

686
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:19,130
just think there's no reason for it and

687
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:21,050
I mean that there should not be a reason

688
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,850
for it and if there is if you feel that

689
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:25,400
there is I don't want to be here anyway

690
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,470
like if you feel that you're not getting

691
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,510
something from me then I'm not this

692
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:33,320
isn't right anyway

693
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:36,130
because if we're having great sex if we

694
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,570
are you know we have a great connection

695
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:43,750
we can talk about whatever we want

696
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:43,750
there's just like why there's no reason

697
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:51,590
what so it'd be cheating I think so just

698
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:59,240
for lack of a better likes or if you

699
00:44:51,590 --> 00:45:01,780
like hippier okay it's very reasonable

700
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,780
right

701
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:11,580
what do you see as the next steps in

702
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:17,700
this relationship the next steps um I

703
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:22,560
don't I think the next step in this

704
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:24,920
relationship is to leave here get a

705
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,920
drink

706
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:36,230
sneak little kisses like and cuddle yeah

707
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:52,560
are you scared I'll hurt you emotionally

708
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:57,720
yeah yeah I mean but yeah because I

709
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:59,460
really care about you and I think if

710
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,890
this if you were to tell me like

711
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,920
tomorrow that you don't ever want to see

712
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:07,830
me again like I honestly think I might

713
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,960
be pretty devastated like I am NOT ready

714
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:15,060
for that yet and just knowing that

715
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,820
something you know this could be over in

716
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:23,250
a matter of months depending on what

717
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:25,730
happens in our lives like that could be

718
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,730
really hurtful

719
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:44,430
but I I'm not afraid of it but yeah but

720
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:48,569
I know I am afraid of it but I wouldn't

721
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:51,660
let it stop me from like being you know

722
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:54,479
or like experiencing it the way that it

723
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,600
would be if there wasn't you know that

724
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:58,830
hanging around here

725
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,830
[Music]

726
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,320
tough question

727
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:47,090
what do you think is a weakness that I

728
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:47,090
have in this relationship

729
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,949
[Music]

730
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,640
think

731
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:29,460
I don't know I'm not a person that lets

732
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:31,020
go of things easily but I think that I'm

733
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:35,430
not a person like who moves on easily

734
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:38,130
but I am a person that like has been

735
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:43,650
because I've moved around like my entire

736
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:49,320
life I think I've maybe had practice and

737
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:54,650
I don't know I think that and I don't

738
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:57,780
really know how this is gonna sound I

739
00:48:54,650 --> 00:49:08,640
just feel like if if we are kind of

740
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:12,390
forced to part ways then I think that

741
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,440
would be really hard for you and it

742
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,800
would be for me too

743
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:24,840
but I also feel like I have a tremendous

744
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:27,900
amount of love for just even just the

745
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:32,250
transience of of like a relationship you

746
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:39,960
can have with somebody and I think that

747
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:41,340
would help me in a lot of ways you had

748
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,650
to be honest like I'm really scared like

749
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,390
if we are if you do move up to the bay

750
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,570
or I like move away or something and we

751
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:53,040
have to and and like we have to break up

752
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:56,760
or however it ends up working I'm really

753
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:05,250
I'm really scared that it's gonna suck

754
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:09,440
really bad for you and and I wouldn't I

755
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,440
would never want you to be hurt you know

756
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:22,700
I know that I already knew that you have

757
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:26,510
to say it because I know like I know

758
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:30,410
that about you like I know how you just

759
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:32,750
like thrive on moving around and

760
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,460
traveling and learning and I love that

761
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,730
about you and I think I'm the same way

762
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,830
but I think if I find something good I'm

763
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:46,970
more likely to hold on to it and I don't

764
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:54,080
think you are because you know that

765
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:55,340
there's you know you know because you

766
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,770
know that there are other people that

767
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:03,670
you know and you know that and I know

768
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:03,670
that too for myself but I'm just I

769
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:10,720
wouldn't I probably wouldn't do the same

770
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,720
thing you would

771
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:23,599
because that's something that I don't

772
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:29,479
want you to be like I don't know how you

773
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:34,519
how I can say this and you know expected

774
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:36,019
of you I guess but I don't want you to

775
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:38,269
be afraid of hurting me it's kind of

776
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:40,189
inevitable maybe because of you know

777
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:46,699
things like feelings I have expressed to

778
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:49,609
you but I just like that's so not I just

779
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:53,719
want you to know that's not what I want

780
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:57,140
like I just want to have things be as

781
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:59,599
they are I think would be and I don't

782
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,849
want you to think about hurting me

783
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,529
because then you will and it'll be

784
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:05,809
earlier you know I just feel like

785
00:52:03,529 --> 00:52:08,150
something will happen earlier than it's

786
00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:10,939
supposed to because you're afraid and I

787
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:14,719
although I'm so afraid of like a lot of

788
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:18,140
things I'm not like I would never choose

789
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,640
not to move on with you because I'm

790
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,469
afraid of moving on with you

791
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,719
you know I would have I would have said

792
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:28,959
goodbye like a couple months ago I think

793
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:28,959
if that's how I was planning on being

794
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:55,680
I don't know it is what do you love

795
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:55,680
about me that I don't see with myself I

796
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:15,970
don't know if you don't see this but I

797
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:18,819
think you just so like you probably see

798
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:20,560
this are you like so spongy like you

799
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:23,500
just want to know everyone and you want

800
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,780
to like know everything and maybe you do

801
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,369
know that but I don't like it's just

802
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:30,640
like when we were a new year at that New

803
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:31,390
Year's party and you were all my friends

804
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,810
and you didn't know a single person

805
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:36,220
supper done really like you went over to

806
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,750
this group of people I don't even know

807
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,220
and you just wanted to know everything

808
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:42,190
about them and you were introducing me

809
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:45,150
to my friends acquaintances and like you

810
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:50,010
just you know I don't know if you

811
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:55,270
realize how like good you are at being

812
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:58,210
like I don't know open I guess I don't

813
00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:01,569
know maybe you do I don't know I think

814
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:03,010
it's just kind of intuitive but ya know

815
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:06,130
I feel like I was looking like a really

816
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:07,990
shy person right yeah I thought oh you

817
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,640
just you ask everyone questions about

818
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:11,650
you want to know and you don't ask

819
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,750
questions that you don't really care to

820
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:15,750
know I think which is important to me

821
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:31,160
what do you love about me I don't know

822
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:34,999
you just there's I think it's a quality

823
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:38,059
that's very difficult to articulate but

824
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:43,339
I know within moments of meeting

825
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:45,380
somebody is and to me it's like the

826
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:48,049
highest compliment that you could give

827
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:53,900
somebody which is just like that you're

828
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:55,970
genuine do you know I feel like there

829
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:59,599
you meet so many people and there's all

830
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:01,609
of these walls and and and and not just

831
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:07,069
like being vulnerable emotionally but

832
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:09,769
just there's just a certain fakeness to

833
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:11,599
them and and I never felt that with you

834
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:17,779
and I feel like when everybody you meet

835
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:20,299
there's just a genuine just a genuine

836
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:24,430
interest in them and also just like a

837
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:28,099
genuine affection and thoughtfulness

838
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:30,200
towards them you know and I think that's

839
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:32,390
really special you know like I think I

840
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,950
think the best way actually probably the

841
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:36,049
best way to articulate is just to look

842
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:40,789
at your friends like the people that you

843
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:42,469
have around you are just like are all

844
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:45,499
amazing and the way that they speak

845
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:48,969
about you is not in a way that that is

846
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:52,190
you're a friend you know like they're

847
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:54,979
you know they're you're their family you

848
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:57,920
know like they would do anything for you

849
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:59,059
because they know that because they know

850
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,099
who you are and they know that you're

851
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:07,549
genuine and and you know that you would

852
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:10,999
do the same for them and I think yeah I

853
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:13,269
think that's something that's so hard to

854
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:13,269
find
