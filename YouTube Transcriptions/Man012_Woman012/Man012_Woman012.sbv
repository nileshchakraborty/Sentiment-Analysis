0:00:22.090,0:00:35.980
what's the most fun you've ever had with

0:00:25.210,0:00:39.130
me and why I think on Halloween when we

0:00:35.980,0:00:45.640
went to the stacks and it was just like

0:00:39.130,0:00:47.290
I was so drunk but I was so I don't

0:00:45.640,0:00:50.320
think I hadn't known you that long

0:00:47.290,0:00:52.570
I mean I'd known you but I think it was

0:00:50.320,0:00:54.790
the first time I felt like I could just

0:00:52.570,0:00:58.180
like be crazy around you because I had

0:00:54.790,0:00:59.710
felt so subdued around you before and I

0:00:58.180,0:01:03.460
even said something like I don't feel

0:00:59.710,0:01:04.600
like I've shown you everything at this

0:01:03.460,0:01:06.880
point I think I said something before

0:01:04.600,0:01:08.860
Halloween happened and then it started

0:01:06.880,0:01:10.570
ringing and we ran around in the rain

0:01:08.860,0:01:17.880
and we had like kissing in the rain and

0:01:10.570,0:01:17.880
dancing yeah it was pouring so much fun

0:01:22.290,0:01:32.920
what's your first impression of me um my

0:01:28.090,0:01:35.350
first impression of you hmm I don't know

0:01:32.920,0:01:37.299
you're really sweet I thought you were

0:01:35.350,0:01:39.670
very courteous because you laughed at

0:01:37.299,0:01:45.759
all my really bad jokes and that was

0:01:39.670,0:01:49.659
really nice cuz I was really nervous yes

0:01:45.759,0:01:54.939
when I first met you and and yeah that

0:01:49.659,0:01:58.289
just made me feel comfortable yeah I

0:01:54.939,0:02:00.789
don't know your s just somebody who

0:01:58.289,0:02:03.729
there's somebody who could be a friend I

0:02:00.789,0:02:08.490
guess a friend

0:02:03.729,0:02:11.650
yeah just like because you were just so

0:02:08.490,0:02:14.530
genuine I think I think genuine is a

0:02:11.650,0:02:19.500
good word you know I didn't feel like

0:02:14.530,0:02:21.850
you were trying to be somebody else yes

0:02:19.500,0:02:31.720
cool that make sense

0:02:21.850,0:02:35.740
yeah what's the most ridiculous thing

0:02:31.720,0:02:39.820
I've done what did it teach you about me

0:02:35.740,0:02:41.980
okay well we went to see after we went

0:02:39.820,0:02:45.400
to see that opera show that I didn't

0:02:41.980,0:02:47.080
like and you liked and first of all

0:02:45.400,0:02:50.290
you're seeing opera in the car

0:02:47.080,0:02:53.500
and then that was ridiculous but we went

0:02:50.290,0:02:54.670
to get fun and you got up in the middle

0:02:53.500,0:02:57.100
of the restaurant and because we were

0:02:54.670,0:03:01.090
having a conversation about how I can't

0:02:57.100,0:03:03.040
like my memory is pretty bad and you're

0:03:01.090,0:03:06.220
like well you should like make things

0:03:03.040,0:03:07.480
more memorable like you should I don't

0:03:06.220,0:03:09.490
know I don't I don't know what you were

0:03:07.480,0:03:12.190
trying to do but you got up and started

0:03:09.490,0:03:16.120
dancing but it looked like flailing to

0:03:12.190,0:03:20.130
me and everybody was like looking and it

0:03:16.120,0:03:25.630
was it was absolutely ridiculous I don't

0:03:20.130,0:03:27.460
remembered it I remembered it although

0:03:25.630,0:03:30.610
there was at one time in the car you

0:03:27.460,0:03:33.780
couldn't oh yeah no there was that

0:03:30.610,0:03:33.780
moment you didn't like that

0:03:33.900,0:03:41.280
well I feel like I failed oh no I knew

0:03:41.910,0:03:55.600
when do you feel closest to me um I

0:03:47.760,0:03:57.010
think I feel closest to you when well go

0:03:55.600,0:03:58.420
with the more obvious answer and then

0:03:57.010,0:04:01.270
I'll try to think of something more

0:03:58.420,0:04:01.750
interesting when we're like in bed

0:04:01.270,0:04:05.320
together

0:04:01.750,0:04:07.540
and our faces are like so close together

0:04:05.320,0:04:12.340
that we can't even focus our eyes but we

0:04:07.540,0:04:14.590
just like stay that way anyways I think

0:04:12.340,0:04:16.540
I don't know I'm just just something

0:04:14.590,0:04:19.630
about being our faces being that close

0:04:16.540,0:04:28.720
together it's like it's really special

0:04:19.630,0:04:31.249
and nice or when we're dancing yeah yeah

0:04:28.720,0:04:35.889
I just that's really nice and

0:04:31.249,0:04:35.889
I think those moments are really special

0:04:40.239,0:04:51.529
it's my dream two-part question

0:04:47.349,0:04:58.429
what do I do that turns you on and when

0:04:51.529,0:05:01.909
do you feel most sexy with me okay you

0:04:58.429,0:05:04.399
do a lot of silly things without weirdly

0:05:01.909,0:05:06.499
turn me on like when you speak in that

0:05:04.399,0:05:08.479
southern accent that's so southern that

0:05:06.499,0:05:10.699
you can't really distinguish what you're

0:05:08.479,0:05:12.829
saying it's I don't know why it's so

0:05:10.699,0:05:14.179
sexy to me it's like so it's just maybe

0:05:12.829,0:05:16.909
the fact that you can just make fun of

0:05:14.179,0:05:22.659
yourself and be silly like that boy yeah

0:05:16.909,0:05:33.799
yeah it's a Texan in music yeah and I

0:05:22.659,0:05:38.349
feel most sexy when you tell me I am

0:05:33.799,0:05:38.349
that's what I feel most sexy really yeah

0:05:43.059,0:05:53.949
if you could wish one thing for me what

0:05:45.949,0:05:58.149
would it be and why um I would wish that

0:05:53.949,0:06:01.339
that you find like the the thing that

0:05:58.149,0:06:03.949
gives you like a lot of fulfillment

0:06:01.339,0:06:07.809
you know because you will you know move

0:06:03.949,0:06:09.949
to New York to be on Broadway and then

0:06:07.809,0:06:13.459
realize you didn't want to be on

0:06:09.949,0:06:15.439
Broadway and and I think now that now

0:06:13.459,0:06:18.499
you're like in school and trying to

0:06:15.439,0:06:20.059
figure out what it is you know and it

0:06:18.499,0:06:24.349
doesn't have to be professionally you

0:06:20.059,0:06:28.039
know but just just something that like

0:06:24.349,0:06:30.379
really gives you fulfillment yeah

0:06:28.039,0:06:32.949
something that you love to do and you

0:06:30.379,0:06:32.949
can do everyday

0:06:39.310,0:06:43.590
okay breathe breathing through them

0:06:43.620,0:06:48.150
what are you hesitant to tell me

0:06:52.090,0:06:55.170
[Music]

0:07:13.000,0:07:24.520
oh I wrote it actually in one of the

0:07:22.690,0:07:26.170
letters I gave you for Valentine's Day

0:07:24.520,0:07:26.710
that you and you haven't opened yet

0:07:26.170,0:07:32.500
obviously

0:07:26.710,0:07:40.420
mm-hmm as a kind of like as an incentive

0:07:32.500,0:07:48.180
for me to tell you because I want to but

0:07:40.420,0:07:48.180
I don't want you to feel like it's

0:07:48.300,0:07:51.970
pressure or like you have to say

0:07:50.500,0:08:03.180
something to me

0:07:51.970,0:08:03.180
in return but I think that I've never I

0:08:04.440,0:08:12.460
think you know what I'm trying to say I

0:08:06.790,0:08:16.980
don't you know I think you know I don't

0:08:12.460,0:08:16.980
want to say it but if you know because

0:08:17.610,0:08:24.460
I'm really scared to say this okay and

0:08:22.419,0:08:31.270
you know what I'm okay

0:08:24.460,0:08:40.479
yeah and yeah I am too mmm and I think

0:08:31.270,0:08:43.210
that yeah I don't I've never I've never

0:08:40.479,0:08:47.620
told any of my partners people that have

0:08:43.210,0:08:49.750
had a relationship with and yeah I've

0:08:47.620,0:08:55.839
never told told anyone that I've that I

0:08:49.750,0:08:57.880
love them and in some ways that like was

0:08:55.839,0:09:05.040
a big reason why my last relationship

0:08:57.880,0:09:07.480
ended and yeah I think that that's

0:09:05.040,0:09:09.310
that's just something like there's

0:09:07.480,0:09:14.020
something to that word when in in like

0:09:09.310,0:09:19.510
that context that has so much weight for

0:09:14.020,0:09:23.440
me yeah and and it's such a special

0:09:19.510,0:09:25.730
thing so I very like I think I'm very

0:09:23.440,0:09:28.699
sensitive and very cautious

0:09:25.730,0:09:32.740
with how I use it but I also think that

0:09:28.699,0:09:35.120
I'm probably too cautious because I

0:09:32.740,0:09:38.690
don't know like when you care about

0:09:35.120,0:09:45.680
somebody and and they're an important

0:09:38.690,0:09:48.050
part of your life and then like they

0:09:45.680,0:09:51.070
deserve that you know they deserve to be

0:09:48.050,0:09:53.300
told that and yeah I think it just has

0:09:51.070,0:09:58.250
something to do with maybe the way I was

0:09:53.300,0:10:02.240
raised you know like in a very sort of

0:09:58.250,0:10:08.120
conservative family who I think they

0:10:02.240,0:10:15.769
play like a lot of emphasis on love and

0:10:08.120,0:10:22.720
romance that's like very serious and but

0:10:15.769,0:10:27.649
I don't know like it's I think it's

0:10:22.720,0:10:31.579
something that's everyone's very strange

0:10:27.649,0:10:32.959
for me you you think you've never been

0:10:31.579,0:10:39.410
in love before or you know you haven't

0:10:32.959,0:10:40.760
never been no I don't know I think I

0:10:39.410,0:10:42.440
think and I think in a lot of ways I

0:10:40.760,0:10:44.420
have you know and I think that I

0:10:42.440,0:10:49.850
experience different kinds of love yeah

0:10:44.420,0:10:51.649
you know you know obviously like love

0:10:49.850,0:10:53.839
for your friends I think is very

0:10:51.649,0:10:55.970
different yeah can I say I love you to

0:10:53.839,0:10:58.220
my friends all the time yeah but I think

0:10:55.970,0:11:01.699
there's something like with them yeah

0:10:58.220,0:11:07.790
there's more there's more wait yeah but

0:11:01.699,0:11:09.529
I know what do you I just think like I'm

0:11:07.790,0:11:13.730
just so hesitant because it's only been

0:11:09.529,0:11:15.920
I've only known you for six months maybe

0:11:13.730,0:11:18.800
a little more than that and it's weird

0:11:15.920,0:11:21.819
for me because I'm like I don't this

0:11:18.800,0:11:24.800
doesn't happen to me very easily that I

0:11:21.819,0:11:32.740
even like someone really like and want

0:11:24.800,0:11:35.959
to go past like four days and I just

0:11:32.740,0:11:38.899
maybe it's not and maybe it's not love

0:11:35.959,0:11:40.310
like yet or whatever but I just it's

0:11:38.899,0:11:41.870
something that I'm feeling that I

0:11:40.310,0:11:44.449
haven't like it's just an intense

0:11:41.870,0:11:46.640
feeling that I have and that's the what

0:11:44.449,0:11:49.760
comes to my tongue when I see you when I

0:11:46.640,0:11:51.260
say goodbye to you when I like I don't

0:11:49.760,0:11:53.660
know when we're laying in bed next to

0:11:51.260,0:11:55.519
each other like it comes to my like it

0:11:53.660,0:11:59.569
comes to the back of my teeth

0:11:55.519,0:12:00.920
and then don't say it because I don't

0:11:59.569,0:12:02.839
know it's the same thing for me I'm

0:12:00.920,0:12:04.880
hesitant it makes it's very important to

0:12:02.839,0:12:06.019
me that I mean it and it's very

0:12:04.880,0:12:08.180
important to me that the person who says

0:12:06.019,0:12:11.029
it to me means it and I think that's why

0:12:08.180,0:12:14.360
I haven't said it to you because I know

0:12:11.029,0:12:16.279
like I feel so strongly like I mean it

0:12:14.360,0:12:17.870
but I just want to be sure but I don't

0:12:16.279,0:12:21.470
know if like you're saying like how do

0:12:17.870,0:12:24.199
you really how can you be like so sure

0:12:21.470,0:12:27.560
so positive I want to be so positive and

0:12:24.199,0:12:30.439
I think really what I need to be

0:12:27.560,0:12:34.850
positive about it is to know that it's

0:12:30.439,0:12:37.459
reciprocated but I don't that's why I

0:12:34.850,0:12:39.310
preface this by saying I don't want the

0:12:37.459,0:12:46.880
pressure you know

0:12:39.310,0:12:49.910
so it's looming you know no I believe

0:12:46.880,0:12:57.560
like I've definitely it's it's been

0:12:49.910,0:13:01.910
there for me too and yeah I guess I just

0:12:57.560,0:13:06.800
don't know it's just really hard I think

0:13:01.910,0:13:09.230
for me cuz I don't know I just don't

0:13:06.800,0:13:12.019
know where like I stand and it's sort of

0:13:09.230,0:13:13.519
my I don't know I just feel like there's

0:13:12.019,0:13:14.990
so much and I feel like we still are

0:13:13.519,0:13:19.399
like a really it's a really new

0:13:14.990,0:13:23.480
relationship and and I still feel like I

0:13:19.399,0:13:24.740
have so much to learn but like I'm I

0:13:23.480,0:13:25.160
don't know what I want to do with my

0:13:24.740,0:13:29.420
life

0:13:25.160,0:13:31.569
like I don't I just feel almost stupid

0:13:29.420,0:13:36.260
like feeling the way that I'm feeling

0:13:31.569,0:13:40.790
because it's like so far past where I

0:13:36.260,0:13:42.120
feel like I should be yeah I don't want

0:13:40.790,0:13:44.279
to talk about this anymore

0:13:42.120,0:13:46.860
yeah I mean I let's do something to say

0:13:44.279,0:13:49.709
yeah I just I don't know I feel like so

0:13:46.860,0:13:52.889
much of my life has been just being

0:13:49.709,0:13:56.819
hesitant or nervous about saying that to

0:13:52.889,0:13:58.620
somebody else and part of me I'm just

0:13:56.819,0:14:00.149
torn because part of me feels like that

0:13:58.620,0:14:02.850
like yes you should hold that word too

0:14:00.149,0:14:06.720
like there that phrase to the highest

0:14:02.850,0:14:09.360
standard and like and and I think I do

0:14:06.720,0:14:12.329
like I but then part of me feels like

0:14:09.360,0:14:15.089
you know like you know you should just

0:14:12.329,0:14:17.009
let your heart be open to whatever you

0:14:15.089,0:14:20.550
know and not think so much I think I

0:14:17.009,0:14:22.589
just think too much about it and about

0:14:20.550,0:14:26.339
everything I could just just churning

0:14:22.589,0:14:29.189
all the time and and I don't know so I

0:14:26.339,0:14:32.189
just yeah I just I'm like constantly in

0:14:29.189,0:14:33.269
this back and forth I'm just like no bu

0:14:32.189,0:14:36.360
like you really care about this person

0:14:33.269,0:14:38.279
like show you know show that through

0:14:36.360,0:14:42.870
words you know like you can do that and

0:14:38.279,0:14:48.019
then and then part of me feels like you

0:14:42.870,0:14:53.370
just don't rush into anything whatever

0:14:48.019,0:14:55.740
it's like it's weird because I get a lot

0:14:53.370,0:14:57.029
of pressure from this is so weird this

0:14:55.740,0:15:00.899
is such a weird kind of pressure to put

0:14:57.029,0:15:02.809
on somebody but from Jordan because when

0:15:00.899,0:15:05.790
he met you and then he saw us together

0:15:02.809,0:15:07.290
he was like oh my god you're in love

0:15:05.790,0:15:08.699
with him you're so in love with it I

0:15:07.290,0:15:11.249
mean he's so in love with you and I was

0:15:08.699,0:15:13.800
just like shut up shut up because like I

0:15:11.249,0:15:15.990
had already been thinking about it and

0:15:13.800,0:15:19.199
for somebody on the outside to say that

0:15:15.990,0:15:20.850
they saw something like that was I don't

0:15:19.199,0:15:23.269
know kind of pushed me forward a little

0:15:20.850,0:15:28.050
bit maybe I shouldn't have let it but

0:15:23.269,0:15:34.840
you know I really I trust him and he

0:15:28.050,0:15:37.900
knows me very well so I don't know okay

0:15:34.840,0:15:43.520
I'm gonna ask you a question oh okay

0:15:37.900,0:15:47.350
yeah okay what do you think is the

0:15:43.520,0:15:47.350
biggest challenge to our relationship

0:15:48.010,0:15:57.050
well I think well I think this is one

0:15:52.990,0:15:59.080
yeah yeah just kind of trying to

0:15:57.050,0:16:02.300
understand where we're both at you know

0:15:59.080,0:16:07.850
romantic feelings towards each other you

0:16:02.300,0:16:09.170
know like and they're just just cuz I

0:16:07.850,0:16:11.240
know we both care about each other

0:16:09.170,0:16:13.940
deeply you know but just I don't know I

0:16:11.240,0:16:15.440
guess they look like yeah the love thing

0:16:13.940,0:16:17.240
like trying to figure it out

0:16:15.440,0:16:18.470
I don't know I think I have

0:16:17.240,0:16:24.200
apprehensions about it and I think

0:16:18.470,0:16:25.670
that's a challenge and then just I mean

0:16:24.200,0:16:29.240
you know we've talked about it

0:16:25.670,0:16:32.090
I don't know where I'm gonna be in you

0:16:29.240,0:16:35.270
know a month or two months or a year or

0:16:32.090,0:16:39.500
whatever and you you could be moving to

0:16:35.270,0:16:48.260
the bay and you know a couple months you

0:16:39.500,0:16:50.540
know which is a challenge I think just

0:16:48.260,0:16:53.810
because you know who knows what's gonna

0:16:50.540,0:16:55.790
happen but I feel like I don't I feel

0:16:53.810,0:16:58.280
like we're in a good place I feel like

0:16:55.790,0:17:02.390
we're both we're both enjoying the

0:16:58.280,0:17:04.010
moment in a lot of ways like just that's

0:17:02.390,0:17:07.190
another reason I don't want to say like

0:17:04.010,0:17:08.870
I didn't want to say that because I just

0:17:07.190,0:17:11.270
want to enjoy it with you because I

0:17:08.870,0:17:12.410
don't know where you know I don't know

0:17:11.270,0:17:14.209
where I'm gonna go just go on I don't

0:17:12.410,0:17:15.890
know if I'm gonna move and you don't

0:17:14.209,0:17:18.260
know where you're gonna be and it's like

0:17:15.890,0:17:21.260
I just want to enjoy it and I don't want

0:17:18.260,0:17:24.920
that but I also just want you to know

0:17:21.260,0:17:33.080
like I want you to know so bad well now

0:17:24.920,0:17:35.120
I do know you know I think about it

0:17:33.080,0:17:35.900
that's how you know yeah and I do too

0:17:35.120,0:17:44.620
okay

0:17:35.900,0:17:47.880
and yeah I don't know like when it's but

0:17:44.620,0:17:47.880
I care about you deeply

0:17:57.290,0:18:03.750
and you know like I do love you

0:18:00.650,0:18:06.120
are you just saying now no I don't think

0:18:03.750,0:18:10.890
so I think but I mean I'm saying that

0:18:06.120,0:18:14.640
with maybe the just like I don't really

0:18:10.890,0:18:17.520
know what that means fully but but if

0:18:14.640,0:18:19.470
I'm gonna like define it for me right

0:18:17.520,0:18:21.630
now in my life which is like you have

0:18:19.470,0:18:23.100
somebody that you care about that you

0:18:21.630,0:18:25.140
enjoy spending time with that you feel

0:18:23.100,0:18:36.390
like you're learning from and growing

0:18:25.140,0:18:39.299
with then then yeah I do you know yeah

0:18:36.390,0:18:41.460
and but I don't I mean to be honest I

0:18:39.299,0:18:46.860
don't know like how that can change or

0:18:41.460,0:18:48.330
what's gonna happen but I think part of

0:18:46.860,0:18:49.980
what I like about us is that we just

0:18:48.330,0:18:52.980
kind of go with it you know like we

0:18:49.980,0:18:56.070
don't really know and I think we should

0:18:52.980,0:18:59.280
just keep doing that and then like they

0:18:56.070,0:19:01.380
said that but I don't want you to think

0:18:59.280,0:19:04.440
that now I expect I'm saying it to me it

0:19:01.380,0:19:06.030
was not guilty no I know I know I don't

0:19:04.440,0:19:08.070
think that you would say it if you

0:19:06.030,0:19:10.679
didn't want to say it but I also don't

0:19:08.070,0:19:12.990
want you to feel like you know now it's

0:19:10.679,0:19:15.120
a thing that we have said I hate that

0:19:12.990,0:19:19.350
it's like a milestone okay you know wow

0:19:15.120,0:19:20.809
I feel good yeah yeah cool okay I feel

0:19:19.350,0:19:29.940
good

0:19:20.809,0:19:31.530
okay no it's yours oh it's mine yeah mmm

0:19:29.940,0:19:47.730
am I the best sex you've ever had

0:19:31.530,0:19:49.049
yes you are mine very much so what do

0:19:47.730,0:19:56.340
you think is the hardest thing for me

0:19:49.049,0:19:59.669
right now the hardest thing for you yeah

0:19:56.340,0:20:01.380
I mean I guess and maybe you can say

0:19:59.669,0:20:05.429
what you think but I've just that kind

0:20:01.380,0:20:09.360
of figuring out yeah school major career

0:20:05.429,0:20:10.419
life you know where you gonna live yes

0:20:09.360,0:20:21.789
everything

0:20:10.419,0:20:24.989
yeah you think that's you got it what

0:20:21.789,0:20:24.989
can I do to improve our relationship

0:20:30.389,0:20:37.090
nothing I want you to do what you do

0:20:33.999,0:20:40.899
because I want to look good no I just

0:20:37.090,0:20:42.159
want to experience it the way that you

0:20:40.899,0:20:49.629
want it to be you know I like I don't

0:20:42.159,0:20:51.549
want you to I don't think that I have an

0:20:49.629,0:20:55.179
answer to that really I don't think that

0:20:51.549,0:20:58.210
there's anything that I think is not

0:20:55.179,0:21:00.759
good right now hmm other than like

0:20:58.210,0:21:04.409
what's gonna happen later but nobody can

0:21:00.759,0:21:08.769
do anything about that anyway mm-hmm

0:21:04.409,0:21:12.460
nothing okay wait you have to look at my

0:21:08.769,0:21:13.809
eyes right no I answered it all right is

0:21:12.460,0:21:20.350
it mine no I think it's mine

0:21:13.809,0:21:23.379
didn't you just yeah yeah that's you

0:21:20.350,0:21:27.330
do you believe in the one and am i it

0:21:23.379,0:21:30.309
what makes you believe in the one I

0:21:27.330,0:21:35.649
don't believe in the one I believe

0:21:30.309,0:21:39.429
there's so many ones that it all just

0:21:35.649,0:21:44.559
comes down to circumstances and the

0:21:39.429,0:21:46.809
right time right place you know if I was

0:21:44.559,0:21:48.700
having a really bad day and I felt like

0:21:46.809,0:21:50.619
crap and I probably might have had a bad

0:21:48.700,0:21:52.029
date and we even never be sitting here

0:21:50.619,0:21:54.789
you know but I was probably having a

0:21:52.029,0:21:56.529
pretty good day and I was excited and I

0:21:54.789,0:21:58.690
don't know it's great to meet you and

0:21:56.529,0:22:09.129
everything was great

0:21:58.690,0:22:17.220
and then so I mean yeah I don't know I

0:22:09.129,0:22:20.220
guess that's right yeah

0:22:17.220,0:22:32.640
then there's only one yeah and also

0:22:20.220,0:22:47.030
statistically very yeah when do you

0:22:32.640,0:22:47.030
think I take you for granted and why I

0:22:50.360,0:23:00.090
don't think I just simply do not think

0:22:52.950,0:23:04.380
that like I hate that I'm like you're a

0:23:00.090,0:23:08.520
great--you're I don't know like I hurt

0:23:04.380,0:23:16.770
yeah right trust me I want to answer

0:23:08.520,0:23:18.960
that but I don't maybe when I like make

0:23:16.770,0:23:20.760
a plan like that I'm excited about we

0:23:18.960,0:23:22.799
talked about this recently when I make a

0:23:20.760,0:23:27.870
plan that I'm excited about you know and

0:23:22.799,0:23:31.260
you kind of just want to invite people

0:23:27.870,0:23:32.820
but it's just out of like oh I missed

0:23:31.260,0:23:34.830
that dude Michael like let's invite him

0:23:32.820,0:23:36.210
- Oh what miss Ben was inviting it's

0:23:34.830,0:23:37.440
like you just want you just love

0:23:36.210,0:23:39.390
everyone and you just want to hang out

0:23:37.440,0:23:42.059
with everyone at the same time but

0:23:39.390,0:23:44.220
sometimes I just want like time with you

0:23:42.059,0:23:46.860
but I don't know that that's necessarily

0:23:44.220,0:23:47.820
taken but your deaths you've taken me

0:23:46.860,0:23:50.429
for granted

0:23:47.820,0:23:52.880
maybe it's just like not recognizing

0:23:50.429,0:23:52.880
what I want

0:23:58.759,0:24:09.840
what do you wish I did differently you

0:24:08.039,0:24:12.779
know something I just had a conversation

0:24:09.840,0:24:17.639
with a friend recently we were talking

0:24:12.779,0:24:21.029
about you know texting verse calling and

0:24:17.639,0:24:22.980
I feel like we text a lot more than we

0:24:21.029,0:24:26.940
talk to each other in the phone yeah I

0:24:22.980,0:24:31.559
hate that so I guess yeah it'd be nice

0:24:26.940,0:24:33.659
if unless it's you know you know making

0:24:31.559,0:24:35.220
plans or like meet up here or here's the

0:24:33.659,0:24:37.489
address you know it'd be nice just to

0:24:35.220,0:24:42.539
talk and hear your voice and yeah

0:24:37.489,0:24:43.799
instead of texting I feel like I feel

0:24:42.539,0:24:49.139
like a relationships maybe a little too

0:24:43.799,0:24:53.039
text heavy yeah but you've actually

0:24:49.139,0:24:58.259
tried to do recently I noticed that yeah

0:24:53.039,0:24:59.970
I don't like just texting anyway yeah

0:24:58.259,0:25:03.590
yeah you're always like throwing your

0:24:59.970,0:25:13.889
phone can't do this right now

0:25:03.590,0:25:15.989
yeah that's good what do you think is

0:25:13.889,0:25:19.519
the most important lesson I'm learning

0:25:15.989,0:25:19.519
at this stage in my life

0:25:31.000,0:25:44.350
what yep living I think something over

0:25:33.409,0:25:44.350
here here okay okay I think

0:25:51.050,0:25:56.240
maybe this is like I'm going to twist

0:25:53.300,0:26:03.800
this a little bit I think maybe this is

0:25:56.240,0:26:09.410
just how I see you but I sometimes just

0:26:03.800,0:26:13.520
think that you aren't realistic about

0:26:09.410,0:26:15.500
things like just it's the simplest thing

0:26:13.520,0:26:19.790
that you're just not realistic about

0:26:15.500,0:26:22.100
like when you told me about three

0:26:19.790,0:26:24.080
bottles of honey this is tiny but I was

0:26:22.100,0:26:29.480
like why do you really bought three

0:26:24.080,0:26:32.210
bottles just so many that's just a small

0:26:29.480,0:26:37.340
example but like in the giant bag of

0:26:32.210,0:26:47.500
can't like I don't know you can all

0:26:37.340,0:26:51.200
before it goes bad okay for myself okay

0:26:47.500,0:26:53.330
I don't know it's like like I just think

0:26:51.200,0:26:55.580
they're sweet so it's how is it the most

0:26:53.330,0:26:59.360
important lesson well I'm getting OH

0:26:55.580,0:27:01.490
so but I think like sometimes I'll seeds

0:26:59.360,0:27:02.960
like take a step back I just wish I had

0:27:01.490,0:27:05.750
a better example than pickles on honey

0:27:02.960,0:27:08.390
but you know you like it a step back and

0:27:05.750,0:27:10.160
you like Oh Bobby that was like oh I

0:27:08.390,0:27:12.290
should have thought about that or

0:27:10.160,0:27:14.420
whatever I just think like there are

0:27:12.290,0:27:16.490
some circumstances especially for me

0:27:14.420,0:27:20.810
because I'm a planner when it comes to

0:27:16.490,0:27:23.000
planning you know like but I think that

0:27:20.810,0:27:26.540
I always see you do that and I always

0:27:23.000,0:27:28.310
want to just be like what why though

0:27:26.540,0:27:30.260
like what it was like didn't you think

0:27:28.310,0:27:32.720
about just because that's the way that I

0:27:30.260,0:27:35.150
think like I just plan and you I don't

0:27:32.720,0:27:39.980
think you really plan that much I don't

0:27:35.150,0:27:41.660
know but I think I always see like you

0:27:39.980,0:27:52.700
know the calculation right in your head

0:27:41.660,0:27:54.170
like another example because I see I see

0:27:52.700,0:27:57.160
buying three jars of honey is like

0:27:54.170,0:27:59.920
planning for the future I'm always gonna

0:27:57.160,0:28:04.660

went hiking with my brother Drake and

0:28:15.060,0:28:21.160
you were like and we were all so dirty

0:28:18.190,0:28:25.510
and sweaty and covered in sunscreen and

0:28:21.160,0:28:28.600
you were like oh let's go visit Jacob

0:28:25.510,0:28:30.790
and his house if he's here and I was

0:28:28.600,0:28:32.860
just like I'm so tired

0:28:30.790,0:28:34.750
like I know do you really want to go to

0:28:32.860,0:28:38.320
sit in someone's living room right now

0:28:34.750,0:28:43.270
with my brother who's 18 like I don't

0:28:38.320,0:28:44.980
know okay yeah I twisted that a little

0:28:43.270,0:28:55.270
bit maybe it's not a lesson movie it's

0:28:44.980,0:28:57.550
just something that I want to just why

0:28:55.270,0:29:00.820
haven't you given up on our relationship

0:28:57.550,0:29:07.420
Oh cuz I like you and I like spending

0:29:00.820,0:29:08.500
time with you and and it's like I don't

0:29:07.420,0:29:10.840
know I think like you're a really

0:29:08.500,0:29:14.140
wonderful person and I feel like I'm

0:29:10.840,0:29:23.200
learning a lot like how my lack of

0:29:14.140,0:29:26.770
planning yeah and it's just it's just

0:29:23.200,0:29:29.070
nice to have you around and to hold you

0:29:26.770,0:29:29.070
and

0:29:34.289,0:29:44.859
yeah well yeah like I don't know that

0:29:42.789,0:30:02.499
the idea giving up on the relationship

0:29:44.859,0:30:04.419
they did seem so far from how has your

0:30:02.499,0:30:08.229
parents relationship influenced our

0:30:04.419,0:30:11.229
relationship I just think a lot of

0:30:08.229,0:30:13.960
people think that my like having

0:30:11.229,0:30:15.999
divorced parents is like the worst thing

0:30:13.960,0:30:17.710
ever but for me I think it happened at a

0:30:15.999,0:30:19.179
time where I could understand it because

0:30:17.710,0:30:22.029
I was a senior in high school and I'm

0:30:19.179,0:30:25.330
you know I it was miserable to be in a

0:30:22.029,0:30:26.529
house with them and okay I can answer

0:30:25.330,0:30:29.169
this it was miserable

0:30:26.529,0:30:30.429
to be in a house with them because they

0:30:29.169,0:30:31.899
were always yelling and fighting and it

0:30:30.429,0:30:34.179
was one parent against the other and

0:30:31.899,0:30:38.349
like that there was just no cohesiveness

0:30:34.179,0:30:42.059
and the house at all and when they moved

0:30:38.349,0:30:46.509
out they became great friends and I

0:30:42.059,0:30:50.559
think it just showed me what I what I

0:30:46.509,0:30:52.960
don't want that like you can have like

0:30:50.559,0:30:55.929
you can find a partner that you're great

0:30:52.960,0:30:57.669
friends with but that's not like enough

0:30:55.929,0:30:58.720
you have to kind of just be on the same

0:30:57.669,0:30:59.739
same wavelength

0:30:58.720,0:31:01.379
and I just want to be on the same

0:30:59.739,0:31:05.409
wavelength as somebody I want them to

0:31:01.379,0:31:08.109
you know obviously that does it that

0:31:05.409,0:31:10.359
means like we can have different

0:31:08.109,0:31:14.529
opinions we can fight and we can you

0:31:10.359,0:31:15.999
know but I just at the core of their

0:31:14.529,0:31:19.090
beings my parents are different people

0:31:15.999,0:31:27.789
and I just want to have some more

0:31:19.090,0:31:30.369
similarity than that but that's I don't

0:31:27.789,0:31:31.809
like they haven't like damaged me or

0:31:30.369,0:31:34.599
anything like that I've been divorced I

0:31:31.809,0:31:39.009
actually think they it's been great for

0:31:34.599,0:31:41.580
everyone in the family divorced the

0:31:39.009,0:31:41.580
hosta home

0:31:48.880,0:31:54.820
what is one sexual fantasy you would

0:31:51.860,0:31:58.000
like to have oh my gosh

0:31:54.820,0:31:58.000
just one

0:31:59.000,0:32:05.210
well definitely the airplane yeah thing

0:32:03.040,0:32:05.600
yeah I always want every time I'm on an

0:32:05.210,0:32:07.280
airplane

0:32:05.600,0:32:10.040
people are gonna steal two people go in

0:32:07.280,0:32:12.500
there oh yeah oh no oh and the flight

0:32:10.040,0:32:16.250
attendants yeah oh yeah

0:32:12.500,0:32:17.060
no no idea I don't know yeah that's a

0:32:16.250,0:32:22.060
very huge plane

0:32:17.060,0:32:25.310
yeah thanks Gare buses but uh let's

0:32:22.060,0:32:27.790
that's like too easy let me think of a

0:32:25.310,0:32:27.790
different way okay

0:32:27.880,0:32:31.109
[Music]

0:32:39.409,0:32:46.279
I don't know I just I think I think just

0:32:43.549,0:32:47.899
I guess just interesting places like I

0:32:46.279,0:32:52.929
like the letter that you wrote me which

0:32:47.899,0:32:52.929
is just all the places that we could

0:32:54.579,0:33:09.459
yeah I guess just different places what

0:33:05.719,0:33:23.929
would you change in me in you in reality

0:33:09.459,0:33:29.949
to make this work I was all sort of

0:33:23.929,0:33:34.809
myself sure I would change my skepticism

0:33:29.949,0:33:40.659
about it being able to work and I would

0:33:34.809,0:33:44.289
stop thinking so much it was like

0:33:40.659,0:33:46.669
thinking planning what's gonna happen is

0:33:44.289,0:33:49.329
and I think I would also change that in

0:33:46.669,0:33:58.389
you because I think you do that too and

0:33:49.329,0:34:06.229
I think it's like it could ultimately be

0:33:58.389,0:34:15.470
like a hindrance in continuing in

0:34:06.229,0:34:17.659
reality I would move the Bay Area down

0:34:15.470,0:34:19.909
just like Los Angeles I'm just like cut

0:34:17.659,0:34:21.440
it out I was flush lost actually I don't

0:34:19.909,0:34:23.779
make Los Angeles and put it up there

0:34:21.440,0:34:25.309
it's way better weather okay but that's

0:34:23.779,0:34:30.079
what I would do I would just put it in

0:34:25.309,0:34:31.750
the middle of the bay okay yeah and all

0:34:30.079,0:34:37.160
the San Franciscans would love that

0:34:31.750,0:34:37.160
[Laughter]

0:34:42.340,0:34:45.699
[Music]

0:34:47.280,0:34:55.470
oh it's ears that was mine so which of

0:34:53.909,0:35:03.120
my friends do you wish you didn't have

0:34:55.470,0:35:05.070
to hang out with and why I mean I've

0:35:03.120,0:35:08.580
never gotten much out of hanging out

0:35:05.070,0:35:10.950
with Keith my friend is not a friend

0:35:08.580,0:35:12.660
he's Dillon's boyfriend so doesn't okay

0:35:10.950,0:35:14.640
that doesn't count I don't even really

0:35:12.660,0:35:21.660

0:35:14.640,0:35:23.160

0:35:21.660,0:35:25.680
nice guy just don't we just spend

0:35:23.160,0:35:27.510
nothing I know don't blame conversations

0:35:25.680,0:35:30.570
yeah the super nice guy though yeah very

0:35:27.510,0:35:36.210
nice don't I both know that too um let's

0:35:30.570,0:35:41.670

0:35:36.210,0:35:50.040
really cool and I feel like I get along

0:35:41.670,0:35:53.940
fairly well with them yeah so my answer

0:35:50.040,0:35:55.290
it's like is like I I have no problem

0:35:53.940,0:35:57.210
with hanging out there cuz I think she's

0:35:55.290,0:36:00.660
really cool but I just don't know her

0:35:57.210,0:36:06.260
that well and my very limited impression

0:36:00.660,0:36:09.360
Sophie okay it's just very dramatic and

0:36:06.260,0:36:12.150
lots of talking and yeah and it's hard

0:36:09.360,0:36:14.430
for me to like keep up with like yeah

0:36:12.150,0:36:16.200
things but like I think she's very loved

0:36:14.430,0:36:17.520
like I mean I get excited like when

0:36:16.200,0:36:19.640
you're like oh so if he's coming over or

0:36:17.520,0:36:22.970
whatever you know like that's cool yeah

0:36:19.640,0:36:26.010
but I'd say like if I had to choose one

0:36:22.970,0:36:42.420
person to was it not have to hang out

0:36:26.010,0:36:44.930

0:37:41.880,0:38:02.340
soft I'll just think about like you know

0:37:49.050,0:38:09.000
who I don't okay well I want to answer

0:38:02.340,0:38:11.820
it I don't know but I've been in

0:38:09.000,0:38:15.510
situations at parties with you where I

0:38:11.820,0:38:19.320
don't know anyone and I want to like try

0:38:15.510,0:38:19.920
to talk to people but I just oh you know

0:38:19.320,0:38:25.860
what

0:38:19.920,0:38:27.390
I you like made it so like you've really

0:38:25.860,0:38:30.750
built it up that I was gonna like have

0:38:27.390,0:38:33.480
this huge connection with Han Solo Hanna

0:38:30.750,0:38:37.560
oh and like I do I think she's really

0:38:33.480,0:38:41.040
great but I don't like feel as deeply

0:38:37.560,0:38:43.440
yes I think you did like you hoped or

0:38:41.040,0:38:45.360
something like she's awesome she is

0:38:43.440,0:38:47.160
awesome but we're just very different I

0:38:45.360,0:38:50.340
think it's the same thing is this for

0:38:47.160,0:39:06.410
you yeah sure very different but she's

0:38:50.340,0:39:10.920
cool how many people have you slept with

0:39:06.410,0:39:14.730
Wow yeah well this is actually the

0:39:10.920,0:39:18.770
question that I wrote down well I know

0:39:14.730,0:39:21.090
and I know I said it was evil yeah valid

0:39:18.770,0:39:23.730
yeah I wrote it because I was just

0:39:21.090,0:39:25.020
thinking like what is something that cuz

0:39:23.730,0:39:26.490
I was like I feel like we talk about

0:39:25.020,0:39:28.040
things a lot and like

0:39:26.490,0:39:31.260
I was trying to think of a moment when

0:39:28.040,0:39:35.369
we didn't like that that stood out that

0:39:31.260,0:39:38.190
like you know you didn't and I remember

0:39:35.369,0:39:44.760
that so I was like so I mean you don't

0:39:38.190,0:39:46.770
have to answer to but yeah it's just I

0:39:44.760,0:39:48.540
knew it was more than yours so I just

0:39:46.770,0:39:51.480
didn't want like it was so early when

0:39:48.540,0:39:53.340
you asked me that it was like we were

0:39:51.480,0:39:57.450
just getting to know each other and we

0:39:53.340,0:39:59.220
were like I don't know it was valid we

0:39:57.450,0:40:00.869
were like we had slept together so it

0:39:59.220,0:40:06.990
was a valid question like I think that's

0:40:00.869,0:40:12.690
okay to ask eight which I don't feel

0:40:06.990,0:40:14.250
like is a lot but I don't know I just

0:40:12.690,0:40:16.170
don't like I don't like to think about

0:40:14.250,0:40:17.490
that so I don't like this you know when

0:40:16.170,0:40:25.110
it's so unimportant to me I don't even

0:40:17.490,0:40:26.490
like that I know the number yeah even

0:40:25.110,0:40:27.840
like really care to know that much oh

0:40:26.490,0:40:30.619
that was the only thing that I could

0:40:27.840,0:40:35.730
think of okay it's eight including you

0:40:30.619,0:40:47.720
okay what is a secret that you have been

0:40:35.730,0:40:47.720
too afraid to tell me a secret

0:40:59.370,0:41:03.500
secretly I've been too afraid to tell

0:41:01.290,0:41:03.500
you

0:41:06.300,0:41:17.010
gosh I really don't know it's gotta be

0:41:10.770,0:41:18.840
something what do you do that's like

0:41:17.010,0:41:26.640

0:41:34.590,0:41:37.770

actually I've been wanting to tell you

0:41:41.610,0:41:47.280
this for so long yeah it was the

0:41:43.140,0:41:49.710
opportune moment okay you um I've got a

0:41:47.280,0:41:51.570
broom whoa wait I was in the bathroom oh

you're in the kitchen and there's this

0:41:55.200,0:42:00.300
window it was dark outside so the window

0:41:57.630,0:42:02.460
is like reflective and I was in the

0:42:00.300,0:42:04.530
mirror and I thought I had a booger so I

0:42:02.460,0:42:06.240
took like a tissue and I stuck it up my

0:42:04.530,0:42:08.880
nose and I was like moving it around in

0:42:06.240,0:42:12.060
there and then I look I just gaze over

0:42:08.880,0:42:13.470
in the reflection and you're doing the

0:42:12.060,0:42:15.810
exact same thing but you're just using

0:42:13.470,0:42:17.520
your finger but we were doing the exact

0:42:15.810,0:42:26.730
same thing and hiding from each other at

0:42:17.520,0:42:28.230
the exact oh wow I told like now all

0:42:28.230,0:42:36.090
and they know what I am too I'll try to

0:42:34.260,0:42:37.950
think of something better a better

0:42:36.090,0:42:39.750
secret that I oh yeah yeah I think I'm a

0:42:37.950,0:42:43.980
better secret well I I can't think of

0:42:39.750,0:42:45.359
anything right now okay I don't think

0:42:43.980,0:42:47.310
there's anything like really important

0:42:45.359,0:42:50.910
that I haven't told you okay and

0:42:47.310,0:42:54.530
probably be very little okay but yeah

0:42:50.910,0:42:54.530
okay so I guess yeah

0:43:04.680,0:43:07.309
okay

0:43:11.590,0:43:26.050
what would make you leave me just like

0:43:26.350,0:43:38.330
okay we kind of talked about this before

0:43:28.550,0:43:42.560
but I was cheated on one time and I

0:43:38.330,0:43:45.470
didn't really care about the

0:43:42.560,0:43:48.200
relationship as like at the time it was

0:43:45.470,0:43:54.770
like going out it was on its way out and

0:43:48.200,0:43:57.860
I like it only affected me because of

0:43:54.770,0:43:59.750
the thought that I had like done

0:43:57.860,0:44:03.440
something that would warrant someone to

0:43:59.750,0:44:09.650
like look elsewhere like but I just

0:44:03.440,0:44:11.750
think like I don't know I don't it would

0:44:09.650,0:44:15.850
depend on what the situation was but I

0:44:11.750,0:44:19.130
just think there's no reason for it and

0:44:15.850,0:44:21.050
I mean that there should not be a reason

0:44:19.130,0:44:22.850
for it and if there is if you feel that

0:44:21.050,0:44:25.400
there is I don't want to be here anyway

0:44:22.850,0:44:27.470
like if you feel that you're not getting

0:44:25.400,0:44:28.510
something from me then I'm not this

0:44:27.470,0:44:33.320
isn't right anyway

0:44:28.510,0:44:36.130
because if we're having great sex if we

0:44:33.320,0:44:38.570
are you know we have a great connection

0:44:36.130,0:44:43.750
we can talk about whatever we want

0:44:38.570,0:44:43.750
there's just like why there's no reason

0:44:46.780,0:44:51.590
what so it'd be cheating I think so just

0:44:49.820,0:44:59.240
for lack of a better likes or if you

0:44:51.590,0:45:01.780
like hippier okay it's very reasonable

0:44:59.240,0:45:01.780
right

0:45:05.510,0:45:11.580
what do you see as the next steps in

0:45:07.859,0:45:17.700
this relationship the next steps um I

0:45:11.580,0:45:22.560
don't I think the next step in this

0:45:17.700,0:45:24.920
relationship is to leave here get a

0:45:22.560,0:45:24.920
drink

0:45:25.760,0:45:36.230
sneak little kisses like and cuddle yeah

0:45:41.480,0:45:52.560
are you scared I'll hurt you emotionally

0:45:44.369,0:45:57.720
yeah yeah I mean but yeah because I

0:45:52.560,0:45:59.460
really care about you and I think if

0:45:57.720,0:46:01.890
this if you were to tell me like

0:45:59.460,0:46:04.920
tomorrow that you don't ever want to see

0:46:01.890,0:46:07.830
me again like I honestly think I might

0:46:04.920,0:46:11.960
be pretty devastated like I am NOT ready

0:46:07.830,0:46:15.060
for that yet and just knowing that

0:46:11.960,0:46:17.820
something you know this could be over in

0:46:15.060,0:46:23.250
a matter of months depending on what

0:46:17.820,0:46:25.730
happens in our lives like that could be

0:46:23.250,0:46:25.730
really hurtful

0:46:33.680,0:46:44.430
but I I'm not afraid of it but yeah but

0:46:41.039,0:46:48.569
I know I am afraid of it but I wouldn't

0:46:44.430,0:46:51.660
let it stop me from like being you know

0:46:48.569,0:46:54.479
or like experiencing it the way that it

0:46:51.660,0:46:55.600
would be if there wasn't you know that

0:46:54.479,0:46:58.830
hanging around here

0:46:55.600,0:46:58.830
[Music]

0:47:13.990,0:47:17.320
tough question

0:47:36.030,0:47:47.090
what do you think is a weakness that I

0:47:42.210,0:47:47.090
have in this relationship

0:47:53.770,0:47:56.949
[Music]

0:48:08.950,0:48:11.640
think

0:48:15.030,0:48:29.460
I don't know I'm not a person that lets

0:48:21.810,0:48:31.020
go of things easily but I think that I'm

0:48:29.460,0:48:35.430
not a person like who moves on easily

0:48:31.020,0:48:38.130
but I am a person that like has been

0:48:35.430,0:48:43.650
because I've moved around like my entire

0:48:38.130,0:48:49.320
life I think I've maybe had practice and

0:48:43.650,0:48:54.650
I don't know I think that and I don't

0:48:49.320,0:48:57.780
really know how this is gonna sound I

0:48:54.650,0:49:08.640
just feel like if if we are kind of

0:48:57.780,0:49:12.390
forced to part ways then I think that

0:49:08.640,0:49:13.440
would be really hard for you and it

0:49:12.390,0:49:16.800
would be for me too

0:49:13.440,0:49:24.840
but I also feel like I have a tremendous

0:49:16.800,0:49:27.900
amount of love for just even just the

0:49:24.840,0:49:32.250
transience of of like a relationship you

0:49:27.900,0:49:39.960
can have with somebody and I think that

0:49:32.250,0:49:41.340
would help me in a lot of ways you had

0:49:39.960,0:49:43.650
to be honest like I'm really scared like

0:49:41.340,0:49:45.390
if we are if you do move up to the bay

0:49:43.650,0:49:48.570
or I like move away or something and we

0:49:45.390,0:49:53.040
have to and and like we have to break up

0:49:48.570,0:49:56.760
or however it ends up working I'm really

0:49:53.040,0:50:05.250
I'm really scared that it's gonna suck

0:49:56.760,0:50:09.440
really bad for you and and I wouldn't I

0:50:05.250,0:50:09.440
would never want you to be hurt you know

0:50:12.470,0:50:22.700
I know that I already knew that you have

0:50:15.230,0:50:26.510
to say it because I know like I know

0:50:22.700,0:50:30.410
that about you like I know how you just

0:50:26.510,0:50:32.750
like thrive on moving around and

0:50:30.410,0:50:34.460
traveling and learning and I love that

0:50:32.750,0:50:37.730
about you and I think I'm the same way

0:50:34.460,0:50:39.830
but I think if I find something good I'm

0:50:37.730,0:50:46.970
more likely to hold on to it and I don't

0:50:39.830,0:50:54.080
think you are because you know that

0:50:46.970,0:50:55.340
there's you know you know because you

0:50:54.080,0:50:57.770
know that there are other people that

0:50:55.340,0:51:03.670
you know and you know that and I know

0:50:57.770,0:51:03.670
that too for myself but I'm just I

0:51:05.740,0:51:10.720
wouldn't I probably wouldn't do the same

0:51:08.210,0:51:10.720
thing you would

0:51:18.829,0:51:23.599
because that's something that I don't

0:51:20.329,0:51:29.479
want you to be like I don't know how you

0:51:23.599,0:51:34.519
how I can say this and you know expected

0:51:29.479,0:51:36.019
of you I guess but I don't want you to

0:51:34.519,0:51:38.269
be afraid of hurting me it's kind of

0:51:36.019,0:51:40.189
inevitable maybe because of you know

0:51:38.269,0:51:46.699
things like feelings I have expressed to

0:51:40.189,0:51:49.609
you but I just like that's so not I just

0:51:46.699,0:51:53.719
want you to know that's not what I want

0:51:49.609,0:51:57.140
like I just want to have things be as

0:51:53.719,0:51:59.599
they are I think would be and I don't

0:51:57.140,0:52:01.849
want you to think about hurting me

0:51:59.599,0:52:03.529
because then you will and it'll be

0:52:01.849,0:52:05.809
earlier you know I just feel like

0:52:03.529,0:52:08.150
something will happen earlier than it's

0:52:05.809,0:52:10.939
supposed to because you're afraid and I

0:52:08.150,0:52:14.719
although I'm so afraid of like a lot of

0:52:10.939,0:52:18.140
things I'm not like I would never choose

0:52:14.719,0:52:19.640
not to move on with you because I'm

0:52:18.140,0:52:21.469
afraid of moving on with you

0:52:19.640,0:52:23.719
you know I would have I would have said

0:52:21.469,0:52:28.959
goodbye like a couple months ago I think

0:52:23.719,0:52:28.959
if that's how I was planning on being

0:52:36.970,0:52:55.680
I don't know it is what do you love

0:52:51.130,0:52:55.680
about me that I don't see with myself I

0:53:01.260,0:53:15.970
don't know if you don't see this but I

0:53:04.290,0:53:18.819
think you just so like you probably see

0:53:15.970,0:53:20.560
this are you like so spongy like you

0:53:18.819,0:53:23.500
just want to know everyone and you want

0:53:20.560,0:53:25.780
to like know everything and maybe you do

0:53:23.500,0:53:27.369
know that but I don't like it's just

0:53:25.780,0:53:30.640
like when we were a new year at that New

0:53:27.369,0:53:31.390
Year's party and you were all my friends

0:53:30.640,0:53:34.810
and you didn't know a single person

0:53:31.390,0:53:36.220
supper done really like you went over to

0:53:34.810,0:53:37.750
this group of people I don't even know

0:53:36.220,0:53:39.220
and you just wanted to know everything

0:53:37.750,0:53:42.190
about them and you were introducing me

0:53:39.220,0:53:45.150
to my friends acquaintances and like you

0:53:42.190,0:53:50.010
just you know I don't know if you

0:53:45.150,0:53:55.270
realize how like good you are at being

0:53:50.010,0:53:58.210
like I don't know open I guess I don't

0:53:55.270,0:54:01.569
know maybe you do I don't know I think

0:53:58.210,0:54:03.010
it's just kind of intuitive but ya know

0:54:01.569,0:54:06.130
I feel like I was looking like a really

0:54:03.010,0:54:07.990
shy person right yeah I thought oh you

0:54:06.130,0:54:09.640
just you ask everyone questions about

0:54:07.990,0:54:11.650
you want to know and you don't ask

0:54:09.640,0:54:15.750
questions that you don't really care to

0:54:11.650,0:54:15.750
know I think which is important to me

0:54:22.099,0:54:31.160
what do you love about me I don't know

0:54:28.039,0:54:34.999
you just there's I think it's a quality

0:54:31.160,0:54:38.059
that's very difficult to articulate but

0:54:34.999,0:54:43.339
I know within moments of meeting

0:54:38.059,0:54:45.380
somebody is and to me it's like the

0:54:43.339,0:54:48.049
highest compliment that you could give

0:54:45.380,0:54:53.900
somebody which is just like that you're

0:54:48.049,0:54:55.970
genuine do you know I feel like there

0:54:53.900,0:54:59.599
you meet so many people and there's all

0:54:55.970,0:55:01.609
of these walls and and and and not just

0:54:59.599,0:55:07.069
like being vulnerable emotionally but

0:55:01.609,0:55:09.769
just there's just a certain fakeness to

0:55:07.069,0:55:11.599
them and and I never felt that with you

0:55:09.769,0:55:17.779
and I feel like when everybody you meet

0:55:11.599,0:55:20.299
there's just a genuine just a genuine

0:55:17.779,0:55:24.430
interest in them and also just like a

0:55:20.299,0:55:28.099
genuine affection and thoughtfulness

0:55:24.430,0:55:30.200
towards them you know and I think that's

0:55:28.099,0:55:32.390
really special you know like I think I

0:55:30.200,0:55:33.950
think the best way actually probably the

0:55:32.390,0:55:36.049
best way to articulate is just to look

0:55:33.950,0:55:40.789
at your friends like the people that you

0:55:36.049,0:55:42.469
have around you are just like are all

0:55:40.789,0:55:45.499
amazing and the way that they speak

0:55:42.469,0:55:48.969
about you is not in a way that that is

0:55:45.499,0:55:52.190
you're a friend you know like they're

0:55:48.969,0:55:54.979
you know they're you're their family you

0:55:52.190,0:55:57.920
know like they would do anything for you

0:55:54.979,0:55:59.059
because they know that because they know

0:55:57.920,0:56:01.099
who you are and they know that you're

0:55:59.059,0:56:07.549
genuine and and you know that you would

0:56:01.099,0:56:10.999
do the same for them and I think yeah I

0:56:07.549,0:56:13.269
think that's something that's so hard to

0:56:10.999,0:56:13.269
find
