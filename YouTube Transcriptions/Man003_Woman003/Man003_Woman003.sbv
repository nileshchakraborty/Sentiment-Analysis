0:00:03.290,0:00:27.390
okay when you think about the first time

0:00:21.990,0:00:30.720
we met what do you remember well I do

0:00:27.390,0:00:33.570
remember the nice dinah restaurant we

0:00:30.720,0:00:36.510
went to called the vagus Dinah because I

0:00:33.570,0:00:40.590
always liked Vegas stays in Vegas stays

0:00:36.510,0:00:44.489
in Vegas I was in Brooklyn my alma mater

0:00:40.590,0:00:47.850
and I like that nice dinner we went to

0:00:44.489,0:00:50.940
and you met my nephew because he was

0:00:47.850,0:00:57.270
just a baby man so I really had a great

0:00:50.940,0:01:01.440
time what do you love about our

0:00:57.270,0:01:02.910
relationship it's extremely interesting

0:01:01.440,0:01:07.380
I can never predict what you're gonna do

0:01:02.910,0:01:09.600
next and you do get me involved in

0:01:07.380,0:01:12.270
things that I probably wouldn't have

0:01:09.600,0:01:16.320
anything to do with if I weren't with

0:01:12.270,0:01:29.009
you so it's always an experience all

0:01:16.320,0:01:33.500
right she can respond my turn

0:01:29.009,0:01:33.500
oh yes sorry I think that was the point

0:01:35.960,0:01:45.689
when do you feel closest to me I guess I

0:01:41.820,0:01:48.270
felt closest to you and in the bedroom

0:01:45.689,0:01:49.470
when we're snuggling because I feel so

0:01:48.270,0:01:52.759
cold in the winter

0:01:49.470,0:01:56.909
mm-hmm it makes me feel really secure

0:01:52.759,0:01:59.990
okay like I smell funny all right that's

0:01:56.909,0:02:03.509
good okay thank you

0:01:59.990,0:02:08.690
okay well what are you hesitant to tell

0:02:03.509,0:02:11.730
me what am i hesitant to tell you huh

0:02:08.690,0:02:13.400
probably when I have to clean up the

0:02:11.730,0:02:15.840
house

0:02:13.400,0:02:17.459
get rid of the crap that you have lying

0:02:15.840,0:02:22.349
around that you don't want to clean

0:02:17.459,0:02:22.799
because you get a little lazy that's my

0:02:22.349,0:02:27.239
answer

0:02:22.799,0:02:28.849
okay how have I changed since we first

0:02:27.239,0:02:32.159
met

0:02:28.849,0:02:34.780
what do you miss about me what do I miss

0:02:32.159,0:02:37.829
about you how have you changed

0:02:34.780,0:02:39.930
[Laughter]

0:02:37.829,0:02:42.719
have you changed where you've tried or

0:02:39.930,0:02:44.969
better yourself you try to improve your

0:02:42.719,0:02:45.889
education I mean you did finally finish

0:02:44.969,0:02:49.439
college

0:02:45.889,0:02:53.120
alright and you're willing to take

0:02:49.439,0:02:54.720
chances do a lot of interesting things

0:02:53.120,0:03:02.310
okay thank you

0:02:54.720,0:03:04.769
oh yeah forgetting thank you what's the

0:03:02.310,0:03:07.709
one thing you can't stand about right Oh

0:03:04.769,0:03:10.739
like the one thing and one thing only

0:03:07.709,0:03:11.090
one but you take my crap and throw it

0:03:10.739,0:03:13.620
away

0:03:11.090,0:03:15.659
that's a biggest thing said the words

0:03:13.620,0:03:23.579
that I clean yeah that's the one thing

0:03:15.659,0:03:33.569
yes okay do you trust that I can provide

0:03:23.579,0:03:35.669
for you no okay all right

0:03:33.569,0:03:37.769
oh that should what do you think do you

0:03:35.669,0:03:40.919
trust that I can provide for you

0:03:37.769,0:03:51.780
oh yes yes okay well that makes sense I

0:03:40.919,0:03:54.540
have some savings though okay I have

0:03:51.780,0:03:57.239
some savings okay that's pretty good all

0:03:54.540,0:04:00.930
right okay but it still would feel that

0:03:57.239,0:04:04.019
on the most I'm the breadwinner yes but

0:04:00.930,0:04:11.400
if I have some savings oh okay you go

0:04:04.019,0:04:16.620
they my turn to pick up the gun yes what

0:04:11.400,0:04:19.229
are you scared to tell me okay if

0:04:16.620,0:04:21.630
anything are you is there anything

0:04:19.229,0:04:25.139
you're scared to tell me oh I guess

0:04:21.630,0:04:26.130
about my my past when I was at what my

0:04:25.139,0:04:28.650
drug use

0:04:26.130,0:04:30.300
all right but not too scared they told

0:04:28.650,0:04:32.430
okay because in my case there's really

0:04:30.300,0:04:34.590
nothing about to be afraid to tell you

0:04:32.430,0:04:37.050
because you told me everything I told

0:04:34.590,0:04:38.970
you everything it was pretty easy yeah

0:04:37.050,0:04:43.230
okay so that's about or you think about

0:04:38.970,0:04:46.740
no okay did you ever want children with

0:04:43.230,0:04:48.660
me no absolutely not

0:04:46.740,0:04:50.790
it would be a beautiful blue-eyed girl

0:04:48.660,0:04:53.370
yeah well the thing is you have to have

0:04:50.790,0:04:56.040
a better maturity level so what can I

0:04:53.370,0:04:58.170
tell you some people are destined not to

0:04:56.040,0:04:59.490
have children except we have a

0:04:58.170,0:05:01.080
stepdaughter from hell

0:04:59.490,0:05:04.490
okay well stepdaughter from hell is

0:05:01.080,0:05:15.000
better than no do it up mm-hmm

0:05:04.490,0:05:16.860
okay what's the biggest compromise that

0:05:15.000,0:05:22.440
you have made that I have not

0:05:16.860,0:05:26.610
acknowledged oh yes I guess not having

0:05:22.440,0:05:28.320
to the children and also not having a

0:05:26.610,0:05:31.350
bigger place to keep all my oh my god

0:05:28.320,0:05:36.630
you just need a whole warehouse this

0:05:31.350,0:05:40.440
place be big enough for you a walk-in

0:05:36.630,0:05:40.920
closet okay like 20 of them yeah all

0:05:40.440,0:05:44.160
right

0:05:40.920,0:05:46.950
that's really nothing my turn I think

0:05:44.160,0:05:50.850
it's you yes who has more power in the

0:05:46.950,0:05:52.950
relationship you or me that depends on

0:05:50.850,0:05:54.720
the activity level when it comes to

0:05:52.950,0:05:56.490
financial things obviously I probably

0:05:54.720,0:05:59.160
have some more power when it comes to

0:05:56.490,0:06:02.160
social things you probably have more

0:05:59.160,0:06:03.750
power the main reason is because you

0:06:02.160,0:06:07.230
whine better than me

0:06:03.750,0:06:09.660
thank ya that's not a compliment it's

0:06:07.230,0:06:11.880
like a badass compliment well yeah

0:06:09.660,0:06:13.950
because you are better at getting your

0:06:11.880,0:06:15.630
way for certain things I manipulate you

0:06:13.950,0:06:19.770
better right you're a better manipulator

0:06:15.630,0:06:28.220
and and what do you better add giving in

0:06:19.770,0:06:28.220
okay it's in my turn yeah I forgot oh

0:06:28.280,0:06:36.850
all right tell me about the time I

0:06:31.860,0:06:41.180
disappointed you the one time

0:06:36.850,0:06:45.380
mmm-hmm you've disappointed me by only

0:06:41.180,0:06:48.050
in minor things usually not keeping the

0:06:45.380,0:06:50.090
place clean by I did do it dish today

0:06:48.050,0:06:51.199
yeah congratulations hey that's the only

0:06:50.090,0:06:54.110
thing you know you just got to get

0:06:51.199,0:06:57.919
yourself a little more organized okay

0:06:54.110,0:06:58.460
not be as much as slob yes that's about

0:06:57.919,0:07:02.050
it

0:06:58.460,0:07:12.080
otherwise no major disappointments okay

0:07:02.050,0:07:14.780
hmm okay list the top the three the top

0:07:12.080,0:07:19.669
three best memories from our

0:07:14.780,0:07:21.650
relationship okay one when I first met

0:07:19.669,0:07:23.690
you when you met my baby nephew yeah

0:07:21.650,0:07:26.600
that was a hoot number two when we went

0:07:23.690,0:07:29.180
on a trip to China China was very good

0:07:26.600,0:07:32.479
yes tremendous three when we wrote the

0:07:29.180,0:07:34.130
camel and Egypt camels difference with

0:07:32.479,0:07:37.820
three things three things that's stuck

0:07:34.130,0:07:43.820
in your mind okay that's you too right

0:07:37.820,0:07:47.840
yeah there was a good time okay what do

0:07:43.820,0:07:53.530
you think I'm insecure about you're

0:07:47.840,0:08:00.710
insecure about hmm that's a tough one

0:07:53.530,0:08:01.880
maybe insecurity and hmm yeah that's a

0:08:00.710,0:08:03.919
hard way I'm gonna pass

0:08:01.880,0:08:07.300
yeah I'm gonna pass on that one because

0:08:03.919,0:08:11.570
I don't see too much insecurity in there

0:08:07.300,0:08:12.979
yeah both of them in my way they could

0:08:11.570,0:08:15.530
play the bathroom yeah but that's not

0:08:12.979,0:08:19.910
real insecurity okay you know I I don't

0:08:15.530,0:08:22.970
see true insecurity I really am true yes

0:08:19.910,0:08:26.060
you have them folks are you really in

0:08:22.970,0:08:30.860
the time we have shared together do you

0:08:26.060,0:08:35.360
have any resentment towards me any

0:08:30.860,0:08:37.490
resentment no not really it's like it's

0:08:35.360,0:08:39.320
a passive man okay - thank you boys I

0:08:37.490,0:08:40.820
guess I would resent if you if you die

0:08:39.320,0:08:43.599
too young the way you live - I would

0:08:40.820,0:08:45.399
present that I'd be pretty unhappy

0:08:43.599,0:08:48.370
they're gonna wouldn't know it that's my

0:08:45.399,0:08:52.139
turn no I was just 60 more years

0:08:48.370,0:08:55.540
thank you why did what do you love me

0:08:52.139,0:08:56.800
you're just that's something you know

0:08:55.540,0:08:59.319
what's hard to say sometimes you just

0:08:56.800,0:09:01.149
attracted to somebody mm-hmm okay you

0:08:59.319,0:09:03.810
just like something you know like some

0:09:01.149,0:09:07.089
properties about them some qualities and

0:09:03.810,0:09:09.790
things just fall into place so it's kind

0:09:07.089,0:09:11.709
of hard for you to really just put your

0:09:09.790,0:09:16.060
finger on one particular thing it's sort

0:09:11.709,0:09:17.829
of a like a total package all right so I

0:09:16.060,0:09:19.480
think that would be the best way to say

0:09:17.829,0:09:25.060
that like a total package

0:09:19.480,0:09:27.480
me too okay hits a kiss yeah well it's

0:09:25.060,0:09:27.480
my turn okay

0:09:29.009,0:09:37.300
what are your financial concerns oh yeah

0:09:34.990,0:09:39.069
I want to get um instead of a part-time

0:09:37.300,0:09:42.100
job I might want to get a full-time job

0:09:39.069,0:09:43.029
but otherwise that's a real concern no

0:09:42.100,0:09:44.920
okay

0:09:43.029,0:09:46.930
I mean financial concerns like that you

0:09:44.920,0:09:49.720
afraid that you won't be able to take

0:09:46.930,0:09:52.750
care of yourself or something happen to

0:09:49.720,0:09:58.000
you would that be a concern I think

0:09:52.750,0:10:00.040
married legally for benefit that's a

0:09:58.000,0:10:03.430
question no so you will skip right yeah

0:10:00.040,0:10:07.000
track time if you could change one thing

0:10:03.430,0:10:12.339
in our relationship what would it be and

0:10:07.000,0:10:14.589
why I would like you to be a better well

0:10:12.339,0:10:17.259
in terms of interpersonal relationship

0:10:14.589,0:10:18.519
yeah not too bad nothing but I would

0:10:17.259,0:10:20.920
just like you to be a neater more

0:10:18.519,0:10:23.019
organized person fit that in the other

0:10:20.920,0:10:26.230
claim yeah I know but that's where it is

0:10:23.019,0:10:28.660
okay I mean otherwise personality-wise

0:10:26.230,0:10:29.920
you're fine into relationship wise you

0:10:28.660,0:10:31.779
find this is some little little tiny

0:10:29.920,0:10:33.550
things in the house for two anonymous

0:10:31.779,0:10:38.130
that yeah weather yeah you're hoarding

0:10:33.550,0:10:38.130
could be improved a bit okay

0:10:41.509,0:10:51.319
what would you do if I cheated on you I

0:10:47.540,0:10:55.559
would give you another chance would ya

0:10:51.319,0:10:57.089
very magnanimous mistake all right very

0:10:55.559,0:11:03.389
magnanimous I probably kicked your ass

0:10:57.089,0:11:06.110
out the window by then you'd be impotent

0:11:03.389,0:11:10.350
anyway getting older

0:11:06.110,0:11:12.209
why do I hurt you so physically or

0:11:10.350,0:11:14.009
mentally I guess whatever you're a

0:11:12.209,0:11:15.480
terrific no I don't think you heard me

0:11:14.009,0:11:17.399
no how about the time when I kicked your

0:11:15.480,0:11:18.899
ass when they took my stuff all right

0:11:17.399,0:11:20.970
well that's different but that's not

0:11:18.899,0:11:23.369
really hurt that's just you blowing

0:11:20.970,0:11:25.829
steam off okay so I don't consider that

0:11:23.369,0:11:31.860
a catfight all right yeah that's not

0:11:25.829,0:11:43.860
really hurting okay your turn yeah what

0:11:31.860,0:11:48.689
is it okay what do you wish had never

0:11:43.860,0:11:51.509
been a part of our experience okay what

0:11:48.689,0:11:53.910
do I wish that never happened that you

0:11:51.509,0:11:55.620
never experienced well I wish when we

0:11:53.910,0:11:57.929
were on the plane that turbulence that

0:11:55.620,0:12:01.429
it almost happened that was scary

0:11:57.929,0:12:04.949
that something more like maybe emotional

0:12:01.429,0:12:07.829
um when you took my stuff and I was

0:12:04.949,0:12:10.620
yelling at you and I and I quickly I

0:12:07.829,0:12:11.279
said that what that's it that's as bad

0:12:10.620,0:12:15.660
as it gets

0:12:11.279,0:12:19.579
it's just bad okay so pretty easy to

0:12:15.660,0:12:25.889
please you then mm-hmm just about okay

0:12:19.579,0:12:30.679

a couple a biggest challenge as a couple

0:12:30.679,0:12:37.619
okay is something that I've discussed

0:12:34.649,0:12:42.689
with you a lot and it always comes back

0:12:37.619,0:12:47.519
to that you're hoarding that's it okay

0:12:42.689,0:12:51.089

0:23:47.240,0:23:55.100
in acting all right all right

0:23:50.710,0:23:57.050
comedy maybe just developing your

0:23:55.100,0:24:00.710
talents a little better or making the

0:23:57.050,0:24:08.420
right connections that's okay Thanks all

0:24:00.710,0:24:11.510
right thanks mm-hmm when was the last

0:24:08.420,0:24:16.940
time I pissed you off when I wasted

0:24:11.510,0:24:18.770
money when I waste money the last time

0:24:16.940,0:24:20.300
you got mad I was like the other

0:24:18.770,0:24:22.310
question it's similar to the other

0:24:20.300,0:24:26.630
question but it wasn't really wasting

0:24:22.310,0:24:28.520
money because I don't waste money no

0:24:26.630,0:24:30.590
you're pretty pretty frugal right so you

0:24:28.520,0:24:32.420
really can let me go to soup kitchens

0:24:30.590,0:24:37.340
forget the free food so you really can't

0:24:32.420,0:24:39.440
say I waste money okay I see we have a

0:24:37.340,0:24:44.300
cup of mice you cook and I clean yeah

0:24:39.440,0:24:48.680
yeah I mean okay what is sexual act

0:24:44.300,0:24:53.420
you'd like to try but afraid to ask was

0:24:48.680,0:24:58.210
that the anal one maybe I just know what

0:24:53.420,0:24:58.210
to do the same my ass hurts

0:25:07.780,0:25:15.080
that was more of a comic relief question

0:25:12.370,0:25:20.320
do you ever think about other people

0:25:15.080,0:25:20.320
during sex and who if you do

0:25:21.510,0:25:34.110
oh yes I would say a celebrity like

0:25:26.820,0:25:36.780
George Clooney okay I was one time right

0:25:34.110,0:25:38.610
the next time I was Brad Pitt okay

0:25:36.780,0:25:40.610
but I had a beat Jennifer Aniston and

0:25:38.610,0:25:47.250
that one all right yeah that was my toe

0:25:40.610,0:25:49.590
mm-hmm what would you want me to do in

0:25:47.250,0:25:52.320
bed that I don't commonly do now oh

0:25:49.590,0:25:57.059
don't say it the BJ's or the peanut

0:25:52.320,0:26:00.660
butter and jelly I just be a little more

0:25:57.059,0:26:03.240
open and not be as germaphobic that's

0:26:00.660,0:26:06.059
probably yet I ask the same and taut

0:26:03.240,0:26:09.600
right you see them in right yes you see

0:26:06.059,0:26:11.520
them in stopping see me no phobia I'm

0:26:09.600,0:26:15.590
seeing a folks I'm in a phobic I have to

0:26:11.520,0:26:15.590
wear gloves like playing doctor right

0:26:16.850,0:26:27.360
and what's your sexual fantasy that we

0:26:26.040,0:26:30.150
haven't tried yet
