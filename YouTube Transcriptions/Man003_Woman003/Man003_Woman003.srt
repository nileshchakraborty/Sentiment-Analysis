1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:27,390
okay when you think about the first time

2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:30,720
we met what do you remember well I do

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,570
remember the nice dinah restaurant we

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,510
went to called the vagus Dinah because I

5
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,590
always liked Vegas stays in Vegas stays

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,489
in Vegas I was in Brooklyn my alma mater

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:47,850
and I like that nice dinner we went to

8
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,940
and you met my nephew because he was

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:57,270
just a baby man so I really had a great

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:01,440
time what do you love about our

11
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,910
relationship it's extremely interesting

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,380
I can never predict what you're gonna do

13
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,600
next and you do get me involved in

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,270
things that I probably wouldn't have

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,320
anything to do with if I weren't with

16
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:29,009
you so it's always an experience all

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:33,500
right she can respond my turn

18
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,500
oh yes sorry I think that was the point

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:45,689
when do you feel closest to me I guess I

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,270
felt closest to you and in the bedroom

21
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,470
when we're snuggling because I feel so

22
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,759
cold in the winter

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,909
mm-hmm it makes me feel really secure

24
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:59,990

25
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:03,509

me what am i hesitant to tell you huh

28
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,400
probably when I have to clean up the

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,840
house

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,459

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,349
around that you don't want to clean

32
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,799
because you get a little lazy that's my

33
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:27,239
answer

00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:53,120
alright and you're willing to take

44
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,720
chances do a lot of interesting things

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:02,310
okay thank you

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:04,769
oh yeah forgetting thank you what's the

47
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,709
one thing you can't stand about right Oh

48
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,739
like the one thing and one thing only

49
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,090
one but you take my crap and throw it

50
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,620
away

51
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,659
that's a biggest thing said the words

52
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:23,579
that I clean yeah that's the one thing

53
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:33,569
yes okay do you trust that I can provide

54
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:35,669
for you no okay all right

55
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,769
oh that should what do you think do you

56
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,919
trust that I can provide for you

57
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:51,780
oh yes yes okay well that makes sense I

58
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:54,540
have some savings though okay I have

59
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,239
some savings okay that's pretty good all

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,930
right okay but it still would feel that

61
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,019
on the most I'm the breadwinner yes but

62
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:11,400
if I have some savings oh okay you go

63
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:16,620
they my turn to pick up the gun yes what

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,229
are you scared to tell me okay if

65
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,630
anything are you is there anything

66
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:25,139
you're scared to tell me oh I guess

67
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,130
about my my past when I was at what my

68
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,650
drug use

69
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,300
all right but not too scared they told

70
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,430
okay because in my case there's really

71
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,590
nothing about to be afraid to tell you

72
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,050
because you told me everything I told

73
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,970
you everything it was pretty easy yeah

74
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:43,230
okay so that's about or you think about

75
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:46,740
no okay did you ever want children with

76
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,660
me no absolutely not

77
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,790
it would be a beautiful blue-eyed girl

78
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,370
yeah well the thing is you have to have

79
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,040
a better maturity level so what can I

80
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,170
tell you some people are destined not to

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,490
have children except we have a

82
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,080
stepdaughter from hell

83
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,490
okay well stepdaughter from hell is

84
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:15,000
better than no do it up mm-hmm

85
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:16,860
okay what's the biggest compromise that

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,440
you have made that I have not

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:26,610
acknowledged oh yes I guess not having

88
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,320
to the children and also not having a

89
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,350
bigger place to keep all my oh my god

90
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:36,630
you just need a whole warehouse this

91
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:40,440
place be big enough for you a walk-in

92
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,920
closet okay like 20 of them yeah all

93
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,160
right

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,950
that's really nothing my turn I think

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,850
it's you yes who has more power in the

96
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,950
relationship you or me that depends on

97
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,720
the activity level when it comes to

98
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,490
financial things obviously I probably

99
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,160
have some more power when it comes to

100
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:02,160
social things you probably have more

101
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,750
power the main reason is because you

102
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,230
whine better than me

103
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,660
thank ya that's not a compliment it's

104
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,880
like a badass compliment well yeah

105
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,950
because you are better at getting your

106
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,630
way for certain things I manipulate you

107
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,770
better right you're a better manipulator

108
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:28,220
and and what do you better add giving in

109
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:28,220
okay it's in my turn yeah I forgot oh

110
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,850
all right tell me about the time I

111
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:41,180
disappointed you the one time

112
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:45,380
mmm-hmm you've disappointed me by only

113
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,050
in minor things usually not keeping the

114
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,090

thing you know you just got to get

117
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,919
yourself a little more organized okay

118
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,460
not be as much as slob yes that's about

119
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,050
it

120
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:12,080
otherwise no major disappointments okay

121
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:14,780
hmm okay list the top the three the top

122
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,669
three best memories from our

123
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,650
relationship okay one when I first met

124
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,690
you when you met my baby nephew yeah

125
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,600
that was a hoot number two when we went

126
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,180
on a trip to China China was very good

127
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,479
yes tremendous three when we wrote the

128
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,130
camel and Egypt camels difference with

129
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,820
three things three things that's stuck

130
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:43,820
in your mind okay that's you too right

131
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:47,840
yeah there was a good time okay what do

132
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:53,530
you think I'm insecure about you're

133
00:07:47,840 --> 00:08:00,710
insecure about hmm that's a tough one

134
00:07:53,530 --> 00:08:01,880
maybe insecurity and hmm yeah that's a

135
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,919
hard way I'm gonna pass

136
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,300
yeah I'm gonna pass on that one because

137
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,570
I don't see too much insecurity in there

138
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,979
yeah both of them in my way they could

139
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,530
play the bathroom yeah but that's not

140
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:19,910
real insecurity okay you know I I don't

141
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:22,970
see true insecurity I really am true yes

142
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,060
you have them folks are you really in

143
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:30,860
the time we have shared together do you

144
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:35,360
have any resentment towards me any

145
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:37,490
resentment no not really it's like it's

146
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,320
a passive man okay - thank you boys I

147
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,820
guess I would resent if you if you die

148
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,599
too young the way you live - I would

149
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,399
present that I'd be pretty unhappy

150
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,370
they're gonna wouldn't know it that's my

151
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:52,139
turn no I was just 60 more years

152
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:55,540
thank you why did what do you love me

153
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,800
you're just that's something you know

154
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,319
what's hard to say sometimes you just

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,149
attracted to somebody mm-hmm okay you

156
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,810
just like something you know like some

157
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:07,089
properties about them some qualities and

158
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,790
things just fall into place so it's kind

159
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,709
of hard for you to really just put your

160
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:16,060
finger on one particular thing it's sort

161
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:17,829
of a like a total package all right so I

162
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,480
think that would be the best way to say

163
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:25,060
that like a total package

164
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:27,480
me too okay hits a kiss yeah well it's

165
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,480
my turn okay

166
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:37,300
what are your financial concerns oh yeah

167
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,069
I want to get um instead of a part-time

168
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,100
job I might want to get a full-time job

169
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:43,029
but otherwise that's a real concern no

170
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,920
okay

171
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,930
I mean financial concerns like that you

172
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,720
afraid that you won't be able to take

173
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,750
care of yourself or something happen to

174
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:58,000
you would that be a concern I think

175
00:09:52,750 --> 00:10:00,040
married legally for benefit that's a

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,430
question no so you will skip right yeah

177
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:07,000
track time if you could change one thing

178
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:12,339
in our relationship what would it be and

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,589
why I would like you to be a better well

180
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,259
in terms of interpersonal relationship

181
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,519
yeah not too bad nothing but I would

182
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,920
just like you to be a neater more

183
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,019
organized person fit that in the other

184
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,230
claim yeah I know but that's where it is

185

comedy maybe just developing your

415
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,710
talents a little better or making the

416
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:08,420

418
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:16,940
time I pissed you off when I wasted

419
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:18,770
money when I waste money the last time

420
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,300
you got mad I was like the other

421
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,310
question it's similar to the other

422
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:26,630
question but it wasn't really wasting

423
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:28,520
money because I don't waste money no

424
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,590
you're pretty pretty frugal right so you

425
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,420
really can let me go to soup kitchens

426
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:37,340
forget the free food so you really can't

427
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:39,440
say I waste money okay I see we have a

428
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:44,300
cup of mice you cook and I clean yeah

429
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:48,680
yeah I mean okay what is sexual act

430
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:53,420
you'd like to try but afraid to ask was

431
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:58,210
that the anal one maybe I just know what

432
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,210
to do the same my ass hurts

433
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:15,080
that was more of a comic relief question

434
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:20,320
do you ever think about other people

435
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,320
during sex and who if you do

436
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:34,110
