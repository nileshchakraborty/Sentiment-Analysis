one right okay do I still turn you all

0:20:39.650,0:20:48.470

you turn me on now more yeah you turned

0:20:48.470,0:20:53.810
out more now than back then like I said

0:20:52.280,0:20:56.120
back then I used to think about other

0:20:53.810,0:20:58.250
people or not just not just thinking

0:20:56.120,0:21:05.480
about you know I know you're I know your

0:20:58.250,0:21:09.200
favorite spots yeah you still turn me on

0:21:05.480,0:21:11.510
- yes are we

0:21:09.200,0:21:15.200
and we broke up and got back together I

0:21:11.510,0:21:17.570
was exactly like the first time I didn't

0:21:15.200,0:21:19.450
touch team like three days when we first

0:21:17.570,0:21:24.560
kissed again after we come back together

0:21:19.450,0:21:45.920
yeah in your room yeah what was that

0:21:24.560,0:21:54.310
whatever cuz you know me so well do you

0:21:45.920,0:21:57.410
think I'm the one for you yes yeah yeah

0:21:54.310,0:21:59.150
I think we always meant for each other I

0:21:57.410,0:22:01.250
think that's one thing yeah that's what

0:21:59.150,0:22:03.050
I was confused at first like like I feel

0:22:01.250,0:22:05.660
like wow I did I already found the

0:22:03.050,0:22:07.610
person I want to be with like I was just

0:22:05.660,0:22:11.120
like like I want to explore further and

0:22:07.610,0:22:13.280
then later on you know but you know what

0:22:11.120,0:22:18.740
I guess I found the person already

0:22:13.280,0:22:21.140
I don't why is that

0:22:18.740,0:22:23.840
yeah because we now we gave I could

0:22:21.140,0:22:25.910
expand as new inventory's with another

0:22:23.840,0:22:27.890
person which is good that's fine

0:22:25.910,0:22:30.680
hey my friends complain about how single

0:22:27.890,0:22:32.120
they are like it's good for them to be

0:22:30.680,0:22:35.600
single you know for the life that they

0:22:32.120,0:22:37.340
want like georgina wants to travel so

0:22:35.600,0:22:38.900
that's all you have to be single now you

0:22:37.340,0:22:42.380
know well the kind of trap I don't see

0:22:38.900,0:22:44.840
there balancing stuff but like the house

0:22:42.380,0:22:49.220
what's a relationship like this like

0:22:44.840,0:22:52.250
long time yeah it's it's rare for this

0:22:49.220,0:22:54.440
actually especially a young age yeah

0:22:52.250,0:22:57.940
that's right

0:22:54.440,0:23:00.950
that's like an accomplishment actually

0:22:57.940,0:23:04.019
and achievement

0:23:00.950,0:23:04.019
[Music]

0:23:05.890,0:23:16.100
when was the last time you almost

0:23:08.090,0:23:22.400
cheated on me probably talking you know

0:23:16.100,0:23:30.290
no cheated but I know if it went any

0:23:22.400,0:23:33.140
further than yeah I haven't physically

0:23:30.290,0:23:39.110
cheating with another person like not

0:23:33.140,0:23:41.360
like touching anything like that but I

0:23:39.110,0:23:53.600
think I was doing the time that's all

0:23:41.360,0:23:55.760
it's that cotechino oh yes absolutely

0:23:53.600,0:23:57.260
okay I see Mildred going through it babe

0:23:55.760,0:24:02.510
and I can't I can't

0:23:57.260,0:24:05.410
she's going through right now yeah I

0:24:02.510,0:24:05.410
heard you for like an hour

0:24:09.310,0:24:16.280
what's the biggest compromise you've

0:24:11.480,0:24:18.290
made that I haven't acknowledged I think

0:24:16.280,0:24:20.150
I think you know all my compromises like

0:24:18.290,0:24:22.280
sometimes I won't stay late to my work

0:24:20.150,0:24:26.270
and I really want to but I want to stay

0:24:22.280,0:24:27.430
with you as well like that's the risk

0:24:26.270,0:24:29.870
I'm taking

0:24:27.430,0:24:31.160
yeah like I say I got in like a photo

0:24:29.870,0:24:33.440

0:24:48.410,0:24:52.460
what you want to do I mean I would do

0:24:50.510,0:24:53.690
the same thing most of things you know

0:24:52.460,0:24:56.390
the thing that I want to do is probably

0:24:53.690,0:25:00.760
in Canada anyways oh yeah oh yeah

0:24:56.390,0:25:04.280
Washington if I want to know one thing

0:25:23.990,0:25:35.330
of something new what's gonna happen if

0:25:39.190,0:25:46.060
who has more power than religion you are

0:25:41.600,0:25:49.670
weak don't know

0:25:46.060,0:25:54.440
no I think we shared up how I feel like

0:25:49.670,0:25:56.480
you have more in anymore you think so no

0:25:54.440,0:26:01.340
I like your tone hey don't do that or

0:25:56.480,0:26:02.720
like hey don't drink too much or no you

0:26:01.340,0:26:07.250

you're out yeah like yeah you know I'm

0:26:07.250,0:26:11.980
probably do I feel like we share the

0:26:08.900,0:26:11.980
power but I think so too

0:26:12.760,0:26:20.120
you know you sometimes want to be a mom

0:26:15.620,0:26:20.780
towards me so yeah I have more power to

0:26:20.120,0:26:29.550
me too

0:26:20.780,0:26:31.630
no no name one thing okay

0:26:29.550,0:26:34.760
[Laughter]

0:26:31.630,0:26:40.250

0:26:34.760,0:26:45.110
the worst neighborhood yeah yeah I know

0:26:40.250,0:26:47.240
especially j-train this yeah no but I

0:26:45.110,0:26:50.810
was fine even died also worried too

0:26:47.240,0:26:52.430
I mean it's a big difference before man

0:26:50.810,0:26:54.200
and a female and not experienced

0:26:52.430,0:26:55.150
something going traveling alone actually

0:26:54.200,0:26:57.140
a night

0:26:55.150,0:26:59.510
yeah you know same same thing could

0:26:57.140,0:27:01.310
happen for both of us love like there's

0:26:59.510,0:27:04.960
more percentage than something to happen

0:27:01.310,0:27:04.960
to you that's about it

0:27:11.169,0:27:18.280
if you could change one thing and our

0:27:13.820,0:27:18.280
relationship what would it be and why

0:27:18.309,0:27:24.169
the fuck out that's one thing that would

0:27:20.990,0:27:26.960
change yeah between us

0:27:24.169,0:27:29.540
oh think so you guys so far all that

0:27:26.960,0:27:33.370
shit and the first three years are the

0:27:29.540,0:27:38.780
worst yeah I think the first thing yeah

0:27:33.370,0:27:41.780
we're over right we're over it no

0:27:38.780,0:27:44.500
seriously I just think like we're like I

0:27:41.780,0:27:46.280
tell people you're my best friend so

0:27:44.500,0:27:48.230
that's the only thing I would change

0:27:46.280,0:27:50.150
I just I want us to just keep moving on

0:27:48.230,0:27:54.049
with our life I don't want us to stay

0:27:50.150,0:27:59.210
there and fucking Jamaica Queens until

0:27:54.049,0:27:59.919

0:28:03.080,0:28:12.080

it's time no we had to wait moving out

0:28:30.169,0:28:37.040
