97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,970
family but then you know like I got used

98
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,790

but I don't say it to you

104
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,270

106
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,750

326
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,050
I was confused at first like like I feel

327
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,660
like wow I did I already found the

328
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,610
person I want to be with like I was just

329
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,120

then later on you know but you know what

331
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,740
I guess I found the person already

332
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:21,140
I don't why is that

333
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,840
yeah because we now we gave I could

334
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,910
expand as new inventory's with another

335
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,890

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,840
there balancing stuff but like the house

343
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:49,220
what's a relationship like this like

344
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:52,250
long time yeah it's it's rare for this

345
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,440
actually especially a young age yeah

346
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,940
that's right

347
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,950

00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:26,270
and I really want to but I want to stay

367
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,430

you're out yeah like yeah you know I'm

402
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,980
probably do I feel like we share the

403
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,980
power but I think so too

404
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:20,120
you know you sometimes want to be a mom

405
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,780
towards me so yeah I have more power to

406
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:29,550
me too

407
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:31,630

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:47,240
especially j-train this yeah no but I

412
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:50,810
was fine even died also worried too

413
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,430
I mean it's a big difference before man

414
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,200
and a female and not experienced

415
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,150
something going traveling alone actually

416
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,140
a night

417
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,510
yeah you know same same thing could

418
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,310
happen for both of us love like there's

419
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,960
more percentage than something to happen

420
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,960
to you that's about it

421
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:18,280
if you could change one thing and our

422
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,280
relationship what would it be and why

423
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:24,169
the fuck out that's one thing that would

424
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,960
change yeah between us

425
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:29,540
oh think so you guys so far all that

426
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,370
shit and the first three years are the

427
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:38,780
worst yeah I think the first thing yeah

428
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:41,780
we're over right we're over it no

429
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:44,500

tell people you're my best friend so

431
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,230
that's the only thing I would change

432
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,150
I just I want us to just keep moving on

433
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:54,049
with our life I don't want us to stay

434
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:59,210

together I feel like the other might be

493
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,690
a situation the only thing I would worry

494
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:49,139
about yeah it's already bills and stuff

495
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,730
