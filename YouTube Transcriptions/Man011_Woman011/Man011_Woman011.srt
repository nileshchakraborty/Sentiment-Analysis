1
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,600
[Laughter]

2
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:59,309
when you think about the first time that

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:01:01,979
we met what do you remember I remember

4
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:08,250
being on a shit-ton of mushrooms and

5
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:11,010
being 21 years old and I remember your

6
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,159
yellow Tyrone shirt that had that woman

7
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,090
on his lap screaming spank me we're

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,370
wearing and I remember you dropping down

9
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,729
on on your knees in front of me and

10
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:28,560
grabbing my waist and me being in total

11
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:33,750
shock it who was this guy and you just

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:37,320
being really cute and total magic just I

13
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,009
remember being so blown away by who you

14
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,310
were and what I saw you to be in such a

15
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,960
quick moment of time that it seemed that

16
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,700
the facts of her meeting in the words of

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,619
Brock Travis were completely

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,820
inconsequential to the amount of feeling

19
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,859
that I felt in the moment

20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:59,880
and that I needed to pay attention and I

21
00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:03,799
did knowing I was moving out to Atlanta

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,799
five days later after meeting you

23
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:21,170
they after the first one we're just

24
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:25,930
gonna be solving this entire time what

25
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,930
do you love about our relationship I

26
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:46,040
love the freedom to be me I love the

27
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:50,239
support in being me I love the deepening

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,940
that I feel every day every week every

29
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,860
month and every year he's constantly new

30
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,620
revolutions that include where we've

31
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,760
been and what we've seen before it's

32
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:06,290
something new and different

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:09,849
I love how free we are together I love

34
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,849
how much we make each other laugh

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,650
love it spending time with you never

36
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,650
gets old

37
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,530
every minute we get to spend together it

38
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,710
feels like it feels just as deeply

39
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:37,570
fulfilling even more fulfilling that did

40
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:41,740
the last time we we spent time our story

41
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:43,330
of yours gets old no hearing of anything

42
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:53,200
you have to say even if she told me

43
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:55,420
before I'm here I love how much you're

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,290
willing to embrace things that are deep

45
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,910
and and close to me even if it's not

46
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,260
something that you're passionate about

47
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,700
I love math II weird program things and

48
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,060
then you might not love that they'll

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,490
still ask me about it I'm still act

50
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,850
excited about it even though I can tell

51
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,530
you're actually excited about it just

52
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,010
two is way easier but you gentlemen

53
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:24,360
genuinely want to be excited about it

54
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,360
because you know it's important to me

55
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,700
there's some things I love about our

56
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,700
relationship

57
00:04:30,220 --> 00:05:06,450
I need a box of tissue when do you feel

58
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,450
the closest to me

59
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,510
it's funny I have a hard time coming up

60
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,370
with the answer because I'm trying to

61
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:34,890
think of when I don't feel close to you

62
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:38,790
because it's such a it's that thing

63
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:42,060
that's so important of the vigilance

64
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,480
that we both exude in our relationship

65
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,610
to safeguard that feeling of proximity

66
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,520
and closeness it's this connection that

67
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:58,830
feels like it's the thing that you know

68
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:03,390
is is the rarest when did I feel closest

69
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:08,370
to you I guess it's in those moments of

70
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:10,230
pause those moments of pause I have two

71
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,870
answers coming up one is the one in the

72
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,190
moments of pause when we're not doing

73
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,800
because we get so wrapped up in our

74
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,440
routines and you know that just the day

75
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,380
of of whatever the day is the works

76
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,890
New York moving around emails phone

77
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,830
calls texts Facebook you know all of

78
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:32,850
that stuff and those pauses of when

79
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:37,560
everything's kind of shut off and we

80
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,910
have a moment just to be without without

81
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,120
all of the distractions

82
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,040
I feel closest to you and the other

83
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,160
times I feel closest to you ironically

84
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:52,620
is when when you're gone because it's

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,700
when you're gone that that choice of

86
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,860
being with you is palpable because

87
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,180
there's never a default to us being

88
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,880
together even though we've been together

89
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,010
for 10 years there's not a default of

90
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,490
our marriage meeting that were in

91
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:11,340
relationship and it's whenever you're

92
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,190
gone and in the absence of you know that

93
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,320
reminds me of this amazing choice that

94
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,780
we live with day to day that we

95
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,740
continually enact and we renew every day

96
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,110
with each other

97
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:28,560
of being together and so I always have

98
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,570
this very bittersweet gratitude for the

99
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,710
mystic that comes

100
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,930
and the wake of your absence of feeling

101
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,610
close to you of feeling close to that

102
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,770
choice of being with you and it's

103
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,700
tangible on those moments of the absence

104
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,700
i rana clay

105
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,120
what are you hesitant to tell me

106
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:16,309
it's challenging because I feel like

107
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:19,639
there's nothing I don't tell you you are

108
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:24,789
so supportive and understanding and we

109
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:27,409
have a bond of honesty and integrity so

110
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:31,129
if I see some girl that's really hot

111
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:34,899
like I look at her and you like that's

112
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,899
fine that's totally fine

113
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,440
so I it's challenging because I don't

114
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:45,100
feel like there's a lot that I'm

115
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:50,480
hesitant to tell you about I think maybe

116
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:54,589
those are probably the things that if I

117
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,920
were if I were to feel any semblance of

118
00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:01,040
hesitation it would be around my

119
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,980
sexuality as it relates towards its

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,230
expression or feeling of anyone other

121
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,370
than you but I still talk like we still

122
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:12,949
talk about that so if I were to feel any

123
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,870
hesitation it would be probably around

124
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:20,569
that because I just feel like it's such

125
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:22,790
a it's such just an unending force

126
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:30,350
that's like this looping record it's

127
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:31,819
like no I know but again it's it's never

128
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,440
something that I don't tell you it's

129
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:36,079
never something that we don't talk about

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,880
it's never something isn't expressed but

131
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,630
if there was any hesitation I guess it

132
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,630
would be around that

133
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:58,810
are you worried about your body changing

134
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:12,370
after the pregnancy why or why not

135
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:14,290
I may be too detriment no you know maybe

136
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,870
my ass will be handed to me over the

137
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:21,010
next six months and something will just

138
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:24,270
be different and I won't be able to get

139
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:28,720
my body back like I expected to but I

140
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:32,380
guess right now I'm I'm not worried I'm

141
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,820
not worried because I I just I feel like

142
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm in this perfect balanced state of

143
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,450
gratitude of what my body is capable of

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,740
like I just can't believe I'm so big and

145
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:46,750
it could grow that size and I can make a

146
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,750
being inside of me and support it and

147
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,060
feed this being and and I also feel

148
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,610
great about how I look right now and how

149
00:10:52,060 --> 00:11:02,620
I feel and I know you're gonna kick my

150
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:06,160
ass like I know like 110 percent like

151
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,440
you know if I say I want to look like

152
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,120
this by the end of summer like you're

153
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,860
gonna support me in my decisions of diet

154
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,870
exercise and then you're gonna challenge

155
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,860
and drag me along with whatever it is I

156
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:22,740
felt okay so um I feel really confident

157
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:24,940
about about that and I guess like I

158
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,800
guess the things that I could think of

159
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,720
that I would be worried about is that

160
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,390
I'm gonna have like some stretchy vagina

161
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,270
for the rest of my life it's never gonna

162
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,790
go back to normal but if you're even

163
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:40,870
that is fine you know like you just

164
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:44,340
gotta do different set of exercises so

165
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:47,680
I'm just kind of in on the process and I

166
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,780
may trust that however I want my body to

167
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,880
be I'm totally capable of making my body

168
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,010
do that and I at this point I know it's

169
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,990
just dedication and hard work and a plan

170
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,600
that's it

171
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,830
because I thought great genetics and

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,879
it's genetics and then it's what you do

173
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:12,600
so I feel really

174
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:12,600
yeah do we have enough sex

175
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,650
[Music]

176
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:35,600
I've tried the word enough sex is just a

177
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:38,420
weird oxymoron one of our biggest

178
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,150
challenges is working in the most

179
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:46,550
magical part of either of our days into

180
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:49,700
our days I feel like just like

181
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:54,460
everything in life there are ABS inflows

182
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:57,380
that revolve around commitment stress

183
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:02,180
dedications that we have other things

184
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:05,210
that are on our plate but I guess I I

185
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:08,720
feel really satisfied at how much we

186
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:12,020
make love I feel like because of where

187
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:17,210
we are in pregnancy we've been in an ebb

188
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:19,820
and not as much of a flow I still feel

189
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,440
like we've we've really tried and you

190
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:31,400
know we've been really good about it

191
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:34,060
even really gonna work yeah I mean I

192
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,460
guess if I were to say enough sex is

193
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:40,880
feeling deeply physically connected to

194
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,490
your partner and that's what the

195
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,670
intimacy the physical intimacy allows

196
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,460
you to maintain and yeah I absolutely

197
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,560
continue to feel persistently that deep

198
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,460
physical connection and lusting for you

199
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,460
and that's really special

200
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:19,079
when do I hurt you

201
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:44,030
you only think I can think of this like

202
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,940
you know what are the instances that we

203
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:52,610
feel you know sharply disconnected from

204
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:55,360
each other but again that's not you

205
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,360
hurting me

206
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,630
it's triggers that bring about you know

207
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,980
disconnection like substance is a

208
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,170
trigger that drink brings about a

209
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:11,750
disconnection I'm not hurt by it but

210
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,340
it's very disconnecting for me and it's

211
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,640
painful to be in a state of

212
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:21,170
disconnection when we're you know and at

213
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,850
any point in our relationship and at the

214
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,460
same time I feel really confident the

215
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:30,140
strategies or just the templates that

216
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:36,650
we've set up to negotiate that it's you

217
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:42,380
know it's but it's still one that we

218
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:44,990
need reminders of there then I guess you

219
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,180
know the other thing is like but being

220
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,700
like a lifestyle thing that you die

221
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,240
before I do that's always like my

222
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,760
biggest fear you know and perhaps that

223
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,060
also rides and like on those crazy

224
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,330
nights of like enthusing or shit tons of

225
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,830
drugs or adderall or whatever it's like

226
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:07,270
you know what is this taking away from

227
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,270
my time with you

228
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:17,160
and then yeah that's what that's and the

229
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:20,730
other thing I can think of is my own

230
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:24,360
fear is about you know my body aging and

231
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,770
my aging you know but that's not again

232
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:32,520
you hurting me

233
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:36,300
that's kind of more men being there

234
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,360
being this very odd inverse now of all

235
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,430
this crazy stuff that goes on around

236
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,170
attraction and desire and all of that

237
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:49,880
stuff those are the things that I can

238
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,880
think of when I try

239
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,809
how do you feel about coming secondary

240
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,809
to the baby

241
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:27,089
and when we had our second last child

242
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:32,790
birthing class I expressed you know that

243
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:34,500
vision that I had was my nightmare was

244
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,990
you starting to have the baby you going

245
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,970
to the process of labor and screaming at

246
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:46,470
me to get out and you didn't want me

247
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:50,460
there and I guess there are two two

248
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:54,470
parts of it for me one is should there

249
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,840
be some kind of a physiological change

250
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,510
that happens from hormones and oxytocin

251
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,270
flooding and everything else that you

252
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:08,700
just your Center the center of your

253
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:12,929
world does in fact become this baby yeah

254
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,650
I'll definitely feel sad and a little

255
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:20,970
bit left out and not quite as much the

256
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:28,050
center of your world and we have been

257
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:31,170
through so much and I know that we will

258
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:36,050
get back to this maybe it's three months

259
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:38,730
maybe it's six months maybe it's a year

260
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:43,320
but we know how to climb back up this

261
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:47,059
hill and get back here and I'll do that

262
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,059
as many times I have to

263
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,860
most important person in the world

264
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:25,480
[Laughter]

265
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:27,460
we haven't needed tissues yet okay I'm

266
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,370
so cold I can't do cold water right now

267
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,370
I'm fine yeah thank you

268
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,180
[Laughter]

269
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:09,990
in the time we have shared together do

270
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:09,990
you have any resentments towards me no

271
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:28,539
hey the only thing I can think of is

272
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:30,490
just so much gratitude even the only

273
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:33,149
thing I can think of is it's just not

274
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,149
enough time

275
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:57,980
am I the best sex you've ever had yeah

276
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,840
one of the things that just blew me away

277
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,519
about you and still continues to just

278
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,159
blow me away about you this was

279
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:14,700
amazingly erotic and sexual you being

280
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,870
longer but the sexiest most profound

281
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,870
lover I have ever met

282
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:38,010
water it's a break here what are you

283
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,010
scared to tell me

284
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:59,179
I just draw such a blank I if I'm scared

285
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:00,950
of something to tell you it's kind of

286
00:21:59,179 --> 00:23:26,929
like the signal that I need to tell you

287
00:22:00,950 --> 00:23:38,929
something in the back of your mind are

288
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:42,350
you scared that I'll walk away no no I

289
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:46,340
think if there's one thing that over the

290
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:50,299
past ten years has really come to light

291
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:53,139
is that you and I are sitting at the

292
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:56,899
table and we're sitting at the table

293
00:23:53,139 --> 00:24:01,009
we're not going anywhere but it welcomes

294
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:04,240
the table we're staying there and

295
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:08,929
whatever we have to do we're gonna do

296
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,700
walking away just it's nowhere in the

297
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:13,870
back of my mind the front of my mind

298
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,870
it's nowhere in my mind

299
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,670
what would make you leave me

300
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:46,900
I can't think of anything that would be

301
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:48,850
realistic of I guess if you weren't you

302
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,300
like if something happened where there's

303
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:56,850
like some sort of break with reality or

304
00:24:52,300 --> 00:25:02,410
I don't know or something but I I just I

305
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:04,330
don't I mean I don't know I I can't

306
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:07,690
honestly think of anything I can't think

307
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:14,650
of affairs or the death of a child even

308
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:18,070
or I can't think of I can't they give

309
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:23,560
even or one of us becomes paraplegic you

310
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:27,630
know I just I can't think of anything

311
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,630
where that would happen

312
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,950
I love being with you so much it's the

313
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,950
most amazing part of my life

314
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,590
what's the biggest compromise that

315
00:25:52,610 --> 00:26:02,420
you've made that I haven't acknowledged

316
00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:04,870
that you haven't acknowledged biggest

317
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,870
compromise

318
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,730
right everybody this is passing is like

319
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:32,870
I don't want to answer that

320
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:35,420
this is merrily I mean honesty and being

321
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:38,990
forthright and kind of telling each

322
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:42,260
other how we feel is is a really big

323
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:47,290
part of our relationship it's why I feel

324
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,290
so constantly connected to you and why I

325
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,770
am always so excited to see you and be

326
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:58,600
with you and get to spend time with you

327
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:58,600
any chance I get and I can't think of

328
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:15,100
what have you learned about me during

329
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,100
this pregnancy

330
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:41,990
I'm trying to think of what I've learned

331
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:47,450
about you that's new I've been surprised

332
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:49,280
that like I've been I've been surprised

333
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,230
at at the fears that have come up just

334
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,770
that I said I may be not surprised but

335
00:27:51,230 --> 00:28:01,160
that's new you know just the the Furies

336
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:04,130
of like you know how will having a baby

337
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,590
like displace us you know the this

338
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:14,540
nucleus like how is our Triad going to

339
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:16,130
be created that's trying to be what else

340
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,460
I've learned about you during this

341
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:21,380
pregnancy I feel like there's so many

342
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,110
things that I've depended on during this

343
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:27,520
pregnancy that just are you like you

344
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:32,570
know you know making me do my exercises

345
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:36,440
you know he needed the hell is like yeah

346
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:40,080
you know fries or something but that's

347
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:43,260
so it's also consistent with who you are

348
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,260
[Music]

349
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm having a really hard time thinking

350
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,070
about what's something that I've learned

351
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,919
about you I feel like I'm about to learn

352
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,960
a lot about you as a father I feel like

353
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,309
it kind of feels like this has been a

354
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,710
little bit like this is the calm before

355
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:59,690
the storm you know like we're about to

356
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,910
learn a lot about each other and that

357
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:07,010
capacity but we're here to support one

358
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:11,740
another as we learn ourselves I wish I

359
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:13,880
could think of something I can't really

360
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:18,200
the thing that you're really jealous you

361
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,610
don't get to give birth and the crazy

362
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,440
totally makes heads because it's like

363
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,830
this peak physical experience they

364
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,240
you're such an extremist you could do it

365
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,730
you would

366
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,809
[Laughter]

367
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,809
[Music]

368
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,060
how do you think I'll change with this

369
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,060
baby

370
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:07,379
that's fine I so much of the roles that

371
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:10,830
I feel like you played for friends in

372
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:14,849
the past has had a motherly component to

373
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:16,440
it where you've helped them to see or

374
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:18,119
understand an aspect you've helped them

375
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,999
out in a situation you've traveled

376
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,099
halfway around the world to go see them

377
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:26,029
you know there's there's a very deep and

378
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:28,259
profound motherly aspect to all of the

379
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:33,960
meaningful relationships that I watch

380
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:40,349
you cultivate and so how you're going to

381
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:42,479
change I guess it doesn't feel like it's

382
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:45,929
you changing as a person so it's kind of

383
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:48,419
like I have to approach it from how is

384
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:52,919
your experience going to change in a way

385
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:56,339
that it never has been before and maybe

386
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:59,849
it's just that there won't feel like

387
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:02,549
there's a tap out you know like I I

388
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:03,690
think that might be the one thing that

389
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,649
seems like it's going to drastically

390
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:11,460
change is is there's you know I mean

391
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:13,049
obviously if I could like you know like

392
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,779
a really late night or something or

393
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:17,369
whatever and it's like dogs still need

394
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:19,440
to go out or whatever like I got your

395
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:29,099
back I got your back

396
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:31,109
always always right I mean you can't so

397
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:32,639
so it just seems like there gonna be

398
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:35,219
some aspects of this where it's like I

399
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:39,089
can't I can't I literally can't have

400
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:41,190
your back it's gotta be you and I were

401
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:42,899
so good about sharing responsibilities

402
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:47,639
whether it's dogs cleaning up house

403
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:49,739
duties whatever it is and I can't I

404
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,239
can't step in for a lot of this maybe we

405
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:54,029
can find out a way around it with

406
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:56,429
pumping and stuff like that but that's

407
00:31:54,029 --> 00:32:00,179
you know that kind of seems like one of

408
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:02,609
the one of the biggest one of the

409
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:06,250
biggest differences is that there won't

410
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:08,640
be a tag urine kind of a thing for some

411
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,640
things

412
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:26,409
what do I do that detracts from our

413
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:26,409
relationship

414
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,210
that's another hard question for me to

415
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,760
answer because I don't feel like you're

416
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,440
doing anything that's detracting from

417
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,860
our relationship like I could say like

418
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,360
you know you're the hours that you're

419
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,179
putting in at work every night till 3:00

420
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,880
in the morning but at the same time IV

421
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:05,059
that as you're very actively trying to

422
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,840
add to our relationship it really like

423
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:10,429
you're so intensely focused on being

424
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,980
able to provide for our family that I

425
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:16,789
know that that is it's yet another thing

426
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:22,429
you're doing for us so I'm trying to

427
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:24,590
think of like what you have been so so

428
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:25,610
much in solidarity with me maybe that is

429
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,649
something that I can think I've been

430
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,649
learning about you know this pregnancy

431
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:32,690
is you really have made a statement of

432
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:34,820
being in solidarity with me during this

433
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,269
time of the physical changes and my own

434
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,179
limitations that have you know changed

435
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:43,070
and arose of being pregnant and even

436
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:46,250
like last night when I'm just done and I

437
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:48,409
just I just didn't want to go out for

438
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,000
the fifth night in a week even if it was

439
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:54,710
just for dinner and you stayed home with

440
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,019
me you know I'm trying to think of what

441
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,820
what you do that detracts from it and I

442
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:02,289
just feel like you're like you're so by

443
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:06,740
my side right now you've so you know

444
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:09,500
you're so by my side in in solidarity

445
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:14,690
and in a shared reality and shared

446
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:18,230
priorities and nothing sprang to mind

447
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,730
that that detracts and again I feel like

448
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,500
if there's something that arises in the

449
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,060
day-to-day we so quickly address that

450
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,310
that maybe that's why I've had

451
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,290
difficulty answering a lot of these like

452
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,139
umbrella looming questions is because we

453
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:33,740
are specifically vigilant against there

454
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,480
becoming an umbrella becoming a loom you

455
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,869
know like we've both sincerely committed

456
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,000
to each other to to communicate and to

457
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,470
breathe to press the refresh rate so

458
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,419
that doesn't happen because that is

459
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:50,230
dangerous that's proven to be dangerous

460
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:53,300
for us and I feel really good with where

461
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,890
where we are

462
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,710
and how are you working for us like

463
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,330
you're working so hard for us I just

464
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,970
every night you're fucking up till 3:00

465
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:21,570
or 4:00 in the morning and I feel like

466
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:34,230
I'm working - who has more power in the

467
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:38,010
relationship you or meaning that's

468
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:40,290
interesting I I guess power for me feels

469
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,480
of course I'm going to the definition of

470
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:48,510
power to me power feels like the ability

471
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:51,450
to influence another it's real it's

472
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,850
really special because I feel like one

473
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,620
of my biggest fears around relate long

474
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,010
term relationships in general is my

475
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:00,660
parents relationship where I feel like

476
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,820
you know my mom was the dominant figure

477
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,740
in the relationship my dad was

478
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,110
constantly succumbing and constantly

479
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,730
ceding his interest to make her feel

480
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,070
better than something that I always felt

481
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:15,720
really apprehensive about in long-term

482
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:18,180
relationships and I guess we each we

483
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,000
each kind of let the other know like hey

484
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,970
this is a big card for me this is this

485
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,080
is an important card for me and so you

486
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:30,990
know in situations where one of us feels

487
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,450
really strongly about something I feel

488
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,920
like we both really concede okay I see

489
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,320
that's a big issue for you that's that's

490
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,880
it's not a big deal I think you know

491
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,770
when we start doing with like schools of

492
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,810
our kid you know it's gonna get a little

493
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:50,400
bit more difficult if we if we have

494
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:52,920
contradictory viewpoints but I still

495
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,070
feel like we come to the table whenever

496
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,990
you and I are discussing something isn't

497
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,850
feelings based right because if it's

498
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,360
feelings based and it's hey this is the

499
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,070
way that I'm feeling and it's about

500
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,740
taking an opportunity to express how I

501
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:08,020
feel and feel hurt or have certain needs

502
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,940
met and that's that's different than a

503
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,620
view point a view point isn't

504
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,570
necessarily about feelings and it feels

505
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:17,110
like that's more where power comes in is

506
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:19,870
when I want my viewpoint to dominate or

507
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,940
take priority over your viewpoint I feel

508
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,700
like we both come to the table when we

509
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,470
have different viewpoints with the

510
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,110
understanding that I'm willing to let

511
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,840
this go this is just a viewpoint and

512
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,980
whenever we're like stuck on a viewpoint

513
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,110
I think we kind of bring that to each

514
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,120
other's attention that hey look you know

515
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:40,900
this is just a point of view this isn't

516
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:45,250
you this is just the way that you see

517
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:47,890
things and I guess I feel like that

518
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,560
really I I can think of so many times

519
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,330
where you have seated because I've felt

520
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,000
like that's this viewpoint or this

521
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:57,160
desire strong for me and vice versa so

522
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,660
it's it's really challenging to feel

523
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,330
like who has more power in the

524
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:04,710
relationship

525
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,710
it feels really balanced

526
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,940
what would you do if I cheated on you

527
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:26,330
[Music]

528
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:33,120
[Laughter]

529
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:36,990
well I guess I just I laugh a little bit

530
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,700
because it's yet another thing to you

531
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,220
know hey

532
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:45,750
I guess cheat in my mind is you cheat

533
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:50,430
you don't tell me you know to whatever

534
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:52,470
extent that makes sense if you come to

535
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,810
me and you tell me something you know

536
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:57,300
I'll tell you whatever comes up I'll

537
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:59,400
tell you if something you know if I

538
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:04,020
don't feel like a priority or I didn't

539
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,370
feel considered or I didn't feel I'm

540
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:13,020
disappointed you didn't talk to me about

541
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:15,480
it or hand or whatever but I guess yeah

542
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:22,290
I guess I'm having a hard time answering

543
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:26,340
because there's video cameras on I'm

544
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:31,710
fine I in a way I feel like there is no

545
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:32,850
cheat it's there's a conversation you

546
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:37,370
know and it's the courage to have a

547
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,370
conversation that's kind of how I feel

548
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,130
do you think I'm ready to be a parent

549
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:58,520
why or why not

550
00:39:49,130 --> 00:40:01,070
I gonna give no one luckier on this

551
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:07,850
planet the being that gets to have you

552
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:10,310
as their mother you are so ready to be a

553
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:13,060
parent my biggest fear when you got

554
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:17,600
pregnant was here's this beautiful woman

555
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:19,760
this Austrian woman with this incredible

556
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,360
body and incredible everything what's

557
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,440
gonna happen when she gets pregnant and

558
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,320
that starts to change

559
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,090
I've heard of experiences where women

560
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,680
start to not like their body or take it

561
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,540
out on the baby and feel like this

562
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,560
little being is the reason that my body

563
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:38,390
has changed you embraced it you embraced

564
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,270
it like I feel like I've never seen a

565
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,860
woman embrace it then you continue to

566
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:46,420
listen to your body and and you want

567
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:49,940
this one with this amazing natural ebb

568
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:52,430
when your body started changing to the

569
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:56,630
point that you know I feel like you are

570
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:58,190
the most embracing pregnant woman I

571
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,710
think you said the other day I can't

572
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,540
imagine a woman not being able to

573
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,610
connect to the majesty of being pregnant

574
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:09,800
because we had heard somebody else say

575
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:15,050
it and so the question are you ready to

576
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:19,070
be a parent I mean I there's not an

577
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:22,720
aspect of it that I don't see you not

578
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:25,490
ready to embrace whether it's listening

579
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,960
whether it's admitting that maybe you

580
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,480
didn't do something quite right and

581
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,670
trying to do it better next time whether

582
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:37,850
it's just making sure that this child

583
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:42,020
feels so unconditionally loved and

584
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:45,200
supported there's not an aspect of

585
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,540
parenting that I don't feel like if you

586
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,700
don't already innately have inside of

587
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:56,600
your being it that you aren't ready to

588
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:59,770
just Evan flow into so yeah I think

589
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,770
you're ready to be a parent

590
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,880
what scares you the most about being a

591
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,880
mother

592
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,580
but somehow I can recreate somehow I

593
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,320
would be capable of recreating anything

594
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:51,790
close the dynamic that I have with my

595
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:53,710
mother and somehow you know through

596
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,660
whatever interaction that I could have a

597
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,600
child that didn't want to be close to me

598
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:02,170
when they reached adulthood when they

599
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:04,500
gained an independent mind and I'm so

600
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:08,860
ashamed about how I feel about my mom

601
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:17,530
it's so scary to think of the child that

602
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:20,550
could ever feel that way about me that

603
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,550
would be my biggest fear

604
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,800
[Music]

605
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:52,180
[Laughter]

606
00:43:49,380 --> 00:44:05,859
don't have meaningful conversations this

607
00:43:52,180 --> 00:44:08,740
can happen no actually it's telling if

608
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:21,280
you had a daughter what advice would you

609
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:26,380
give her regarding boys or men I would

610
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:31,240
tell her that she is the conduit of

611
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:33,339
vulnerability she has the ability it's

612
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:38,500
naturally wired in her women naturally

613
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:41,170
have this to be so deeply connected to

614
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:45,390
being vulnerable and that's something

615
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:52,119
that men so deeply need to be shown and

616
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:56,460
with that comes a great power and with

617
00:44:52,119 --> 00:45:00,549
that also comes a great risk because

618
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:05,380
women who were vulnerable women who are

619
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:10,299
showing men the way can be scary and men

620
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:13,030
can do bad things and so I would ask her

621
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:17,170
and tell her to trust her intuition

622
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:21,280
about people and I would also tell her

623
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:24,730
to trust and really try to connect

624
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:30,609
people to that vulnerability of human

625
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:34,450
emotion of connection because she being

626
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:38,099
a woman is is the natural carrier she is

627
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,099
the conduit she is the pathway

628
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,170
and I could pour her with hours upon

629
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,560
hours of things that I would tell her

630
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:49,520
about the film and that would probably

631
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,750
be the one of the biggest and most

632
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,750
important pieces that I would tell her
