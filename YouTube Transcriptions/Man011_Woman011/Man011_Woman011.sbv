0:00:42.480,0:00:48.600
[Laughter]

0:00:46.350,0:00:59.309
when you think about the first time that

0:00:48.600,0:01:01.979
we met what do you remember I remember

0:00:59.309,0:01:08.250
being on a shit-ton of mushrooms and

0:01:01.979,0:01:11.010
being 21 years old and I remember your

0:01:08.250,0:01:14.159
yellow Tyrone shirt that had that woman

0:01:11.010,0:01:18.090
on his lap screaming spank me we're

0:01:14.159,0:01:20.370
wearing and I remember you dropping down

0:01:18.090,0:01:23.729
on on your knees in front of me and

0:01:20.370,0:01:28.560
grabbing my waist and me being in total

0:01:23.729,0:01:33.750
shock it who was this guy and you just

0:01:28.560,0:01:37.320
being really cute and total magic just I

0:01:33.750,0:01:41.009
remember being so blown away by who you

0:01:37.320,0:01:43.310
were and what I saw you to be in such a

0:01:41.009,0:01:45.960
quick moment of time that it seemed that

0:01:43.310,0:01:47.700
the facts of her meeting in the words of

0:01:45.960,0:01:49.619
Brock Travis were completely

0:01:47.700,0:01:50.820
inconsequential to the amount of feeling

0:01:49.619,0:01:54.859
that I felt in the moment

0:01:50.820,0:01:59.880
and that I needed to pay attention and I

0:01:54.859,0:02:03.799
did knowing I was moving out to Atlanta

0:01:59.880,0:02:03.799
five days later after meeting you

0:02:12.459,0:02:21.170
they after the first one we're just

0:02:16.580,0:02:25.930
gonna be solving this entire time what

0:02:21.170,0:02:25.930
do you love about our relationship I

0:02:31.780,0:02:46.040
love the freedom to be me I love the

0:02:36.920,0:02:50.239
support in being me I love the deepening

0:02:46.040,0:02:52.940
that I feel every day every week every

0:02:50.239,0:02:54.860
month and every year he's constantly new

0:02:52.940,0:02:57.620
revolutions that include where we've

0:02:54.860,0:02:58.760
been and what we've seen before it's

0:02:57.620,0:03:06.290
something new and different

0:02:58.760,0:03:09.849
I love how free we are together I love

0:03:06.290,0:03:09.849
how much we make each other laugh

0:03:17.880,0:03:22.650
love it spending time with you never

0:03:20.110,0:03:22.650
gets old

0:03:23.610,0:03:29.530
every minute we get to spend together it

0:03:26.020,0:03:32.710
feels like it feels just as deeply

0:03:29.530,0:03:37.570
fulfilling even more fulfilling that did

0:03:32.710,0:03:41.740
the last time we we spent time our story

0:03:37.570,0:03:43.330
of yours gets old no hearing of anything

0:03:41.740,0:03:53.200
you have to say even if she told me

0:03:43.330,0:03:55.420
before I'm here I love how much you're

0:03:53.200,0:03:59.290
willing to embrace things that are deep

0:03:55.420,0:04:00.910
and and close to me even if it's not

0:03:59.290,0:04:04.260
something that you're passionate about

0:04:00.910,0:04:06.700
I love math II weird program things and

0:04:04.260,0:04:10.060
then you might not love that they'll

0:04:06.700,0:04:12.490
still ask me about it I'm still act

0:04:10.060,0:04:15.850
excited about it even though I can tell

0:04:12.490,0:04:17.530
you're actually excited about it just

0:04:15.850,0:04:20.010
two is way easier but you gentlemen

0:04:17.530,0:04:24.360
genuinely want to be excited about it

0:04:20.010,0:04:24.360
because you know it's important to me

0:04:24.780,0:04:29.700
there's some things I love about our

0:04:27.040,0:04:29.700
relationship

0:04:30.220,0:05:06.450
I need a box of tissue when do you feel

0:05:03.010,0:05:06.450
the closest to me

0:05:22.740,0:05:27.510
it's funny I have a hard time coming up

0:05:25.470,0:05:31.370
with the answer because I'm trying to

0:05:27.510,0:05:34.890
think of when I don't feel close to you

0:05:31.370,0:05:38.790
because it's such a it's that thing

0:05:34.890,0:05:42.060
that's so important of the vigilance

0:05:38.790,0:05:45.480
that we both exude in our relationship

0:05:42.060,0:05:47.610
to safeguard that feeling of proximity

0:05:45.480,0:05:52.520
and closeness it's this connection that

0:05:47.610,0:05:58.830
feels like it's the thing that you know

0:05:52.520,0:06:03.390
is is the rarest when did I feel closest

0:05:58.830,0:06:08.370
to you I guess it's in those moments of

0:06:03.390,0:06:10.230
pause those moments of pause I have two

0:06:08.370,0:06:11.870
answers coming up one is the one in the

0:06:10.230,0:06:14.190
moments of pause when we're not doing

0:06:11.870,0:06:16.800
because we get so wrapped up in our

0:06:14.190,0:06:19.440
routines and you know that just the day

0:06:16.800,0:06:22.380
of of whatever the day is the works

0:06:19.440,0:06:25.890
New York moving around emails phone

0:06:22.380,0:06:28.830
calls texts Facebook you know all of

0:06:25.890,0:06:32.850
that stuff and those pauses of when

0:06:28.830,0:06:37.560
everything's kind of shut off and we

0:06:32.850,0:06:38.910
have a moment just to be without without

0:06:37.560,0:06:42.120
all of the distractions

0:06:38.910,0:06:44.040
I feel closest to you and the other

0:06:42.120,0:06:50.160
times I feel closest to you ironically

0:06:44.040,0:06:52.620
is when when you're gone because it's

0:06:50.160,0:06:56.700
when you're gone that that choice of

0:06:52.620,0:06:58.860
being with you is palpable because

0:06:56.700,0:07:00.180
there's never a default to us being

0:06:58.860,0:07:02.880
together even though we've been together

0:07:00.180,0:07:05.010
for 10 years there's not a default of

0:07:02.880,0:07:08.490
our marriage meeting that were in

0:07:05.010,0:07:11.340
relationship and it's whenever you're

0:07:08.490,0:07:14.190
gone and in the absence of you know that

0:07:11.340,0:07:16.320
reminds me of this amazing choice that

0:07:14.190,0:07:18.780
we live with day to day that we

0:07:16.320,0:07:19.740
continually enact and we renew every day

0:07:18.780,0:07:25.110
with each other

0:07:19.740,0:07:28.560
of being together and so I always have

0:07:25.110,0:07:30.570
this very bittersweet gratitude for the

0:07:28.560,0:07:34.710
mystic that comes

0:07:30.570,0:07:36.930
and the wake of your absence of feeling

0:07:34.710,0:07:41.610
close to you of feeling close to that

0:07:36.930,0:07:43.770
choice of being with you and it's

0:07:41.610,0:07:46.700
tangible on those moments of the absence

0:07:43.770,0:07:46.700
i rana clay

0:07:53.900,0:07:59.120
what are you hesitant to tell me

0:08:10.689,0:08:16.309
it's challenging because I feel like

0:08:13.069,0:08:19.639
there's nothing I don't tell you you are

0:08:16.309,0:08:24.789
so supportive and understanding and we

0:08:19.639,0:08:27.409
have a bond of honesty and integrity so

0:08:24.789,0:08:31.129
if I see some girl that's really hot

0:08:27.409,0:08:34.899
like I look at her and you like that's

0:08:31.129,0:08:34.899
fine that's totally fine

0:08:34.959,0:08:39.440
so I it's challenging because I don't

0:08:37.909,0:08:45.100
feel like there's a lot that I'm

0:08:39.440,0:08:50.480
hesitant to tell you about I think maybe

0:08:45.100,0:08:54.589
those are probably the things that if I

0:08:50.480,0:08:57.920
were if I were to feel any semblance of

0:08:54.589,0:09:01.040
hesitation it would be around my

0:08:57.920,0:09:03.980
sexuality as it relates towards its

0:09:01.040,0:09:06.230
expression or feeling of anyone other

0:09:03.980,0:09:10.370
than you but I still talk like we still

0:09:06.230,0:09:12.949
talk about that so if I were to feel any

0:09:10.370,0:09:14.870
hesitation it would be probably around

0:09:12.949,0:09:20.569
that because I just feel like it's such

0:09:14.870,0:09:22.790
a it's such just an unending force

0:09:20.569,0:09:30.350
that's like this looping record it's

0:09:22.790,0:09:31.819
like no I know but again it's it's never

0:09:30.350,0:09:33.440
something that I don't tell you it's

0:09:31.819,0:09:36.079
never something that we don't talk about

0:09:33.440,0:09:37.880
it's never something isn't expressed but

0:09:36.079,0:09:40.630
if there was any hesitation I guess it

0:09:37.880,0:09:40.630
would be around that

0:09:51.660,0:09:58.810
are you worried about your body changing

0:09:55.180,0:10:12.370
after the pregnancy why or why not

0:09:58.810,0:10:14.290
I may be too detriment no you know maybe

0:10:12.370,0:10:16.870
my ass will be handed to me over the

0:10:14.290,0:10:21.010
next six months and something will just

0:10:16.870,0:10:24.270
be different and I won't be able to get

0:10:21.010,0:10:28.720
my body back like I expected to but I

0:10:24.270,0:10:32.380
guess right now I'm I'm not worried I'm

0:10:28.720,0:10:33.820
not worried because I I just I feel like

0:10:32.380,0:10:36.000
I'm in this perfect balanced state of

0:10:33.820,0:10:40.450
gratitude of what my body is capable of

0:10:36.000,0:10:44.740
like I just can't believe I'm so big and

0:10:40.450,0:10:46.750
it could grow that size and I can make a

0:10:44.740,0:10:49.750
being inside of me and support it and

0:10:46.750,0:10:52.060
feed this being and and I also feel

0:10:49.750,0:10:54.610
great about how I look right now and how

0:10:52.060,0:11:02.620
I feel and I know you're gonna kick my

0:10:54.610,0:11:06.160
ass like I know like 110 percent like

0:11:02.620,0:11:08.440
you know if I say I want to look like

0:11:06.160,0:11:10.120
this by the end of summer like you're

0:11:08.440,0:11:11.860
gonna support me in my decisions of diet

0:11:10.120,0:11:13.870
exercise and then you're gonna challenge

0:11:11.860,0:11:17.860
and drag me along with whatever it is I

0:11:13.870,0:11:22.740
felt okay so um I feel really confident

0:11:17.860,0:11:24.940
about about that and I guess like I

0:11:22.740,0:11:26.800
guess the things that I could think of

0:11:24.940,0:11:28.720
that I would be worried about is that

0:11:26.800,0:11:31.390
I'm gonna have like some stretchy vagina

0:11:28.720,0:11:34.270
for the rest of my life it's never gonna

0:11:31.390,0:11:36.790
go back to normal but if you're even

0:11:34.270,0:11:40.870
that is fine you know like you just

0:11:36.790,0:11:44.340
gotta do different set of exercises so

0:11:40.870,0:11:47.680
I'm just kind of in on the process and I

0:11:44.340,0:11:49.780
may trust that however I want my body to

0:11:47.680,0:11:51.880
be I'm totally capable of making my body

0:11:49.780,0:11:54.010
do that and I at this point I know it's

0:11:51.880,0:11:54.990
just dedication and hard work and a plan

0:11:54.010,0:11:57.600
that's it

0:11:54.990,0:11:59.830
because I thought great genetics and

0:11:57.600,0:12:02.879
it's genetics and then it's what you do

0:11:59.830,0:12:12.600
so I feel really

0:12:02.879,0:12:12.600
yeah do we have enough sex

0:12:17.970,0:12:23.650
[Music]

0:12:19.750,0:12:35.600
I've tried the word enough sex is just a

0:12:23.650,0:12:38.420
weird oxymoron one of our biggest

0:12:35.600,0:12:41.150
challenges is working in the most

0:12:38.420,0:12:46.550
magical part of either of our days into

0:12:41.150,0:12:49.700
our days I feel like just like

0:12:46.550,0:12:54.460
everything in life there are ABS inflows

0:12:49.700,0:12:57.380
that revolve around commitment stress

0:12:54.460,0:13:02.180
dedications that we have other things

0:12:57.380,0:13:05.210
that are on our plate but I guess I I

0:13:02.180,0:13:08.720
feel really satisfied at how much we

0:13:05.210,0:13:12.020
make love I feel like because of where

0:13:08.720,0:13:17.210
we are in pregnancy we've been in an ebb

0:13:12.020,0:13:19.820
and not as much of a flow I still feel

0:13:17.210,0:13:21.440
like we've we've really tried and you

0:13:19.820,0:13:31.400
know we've been really good about it

0:13:21.440,0:13:34.060
even really gonna work yeah I mean I

0:13:31.400,0:13:37.460
guess if I were to say enough sex is

0:13:34.060,0:13:40.880
feeling deeply physically connected to

0:13:37.460,0:13:43.490
your partner and that's what the

0:13:40.880,0:13:46.670
intimacy the physical intimacy allows

0:13:43.490,0:13:49.460
you to maintain and yeah I absolutely

0:13:46.670,0:13:51.560
continue to feel persistently that deep

0:13:49.460,0:13:54.460
physical connection and lusting for you

0:13:51.560,0:13:54.460
and that's really special

0:14:15.149,0:14:19.079
when do I hurt you

0:14:38.450,0:14:44.030
you only think I can think of this like

0:14:40.940,0:14:46.940
you know what are the instances that we

0:14:44.030,0:14:52.610
feel you know sharply disconnected from

0:14:46.940,0:14:55.360
each other but again that's not you

0:14:52.610,0:14:55.360
hurting me

0:14:55.720,0:15:02.630
it's triggers that bring about you know

0:15:00.250,0:15:03.980
disconnection like substance is a

0:15:02.630,0:15:09.170
trigger that drink brings about a

0:15:03.980,0:15:11.750
disconnection I'm not hurt by it but

0:15:09.170,0:15:13.340
it's very disconnecting for me and it's

0:15:11.750,0:15:16.640
painful to be in a state of

0:15:13.340,0:15:21.170
disconnection when we're you know and at

0:15:16.640,0:15:22.850
any point in our relationship and at the

0:15:21.170,0:15:25.460
same time I feel really confident the

0:15:22.850,0:15:30.140
strategies or just the templates that

0:15:25.460,0:15:36.650
we've set up to negotiate that it's you

0:15:30.140,0:15:42.380
know it's but it's still one that we

0:15:36.650,0:15:44.990
need reminders of there then I guess you

0:15:42.380,0:15:47.180
know the other thing is like but being

0:15:44.990,0:15:49.700
like a lifestyle thing that you die

0:15:47.180,0:15:53.240
before I do that's always like my

0:15:49.700,0:15:55.760
biggest fear you know and perhaps that

0:15:53.240,0:15:59.060
also rides and like on those crazy

0:15:55.760,0:16:01.330
nights of like enthusing or shit tons of

0:15:59.060,0:16:03.830
drugs or adderall or whatever it's like

0:16:01.330,0:16:07.270
you know what is this taking away from

0:16:03.830,0:16:07.270
my time with you

0:16:08.660,0:16:17.160
and then yeah that's what that's and the

0:16:14.310,0:16:20.730
other thing I can think of is my own

0:16:17.160,0:16:24.360
fear is about you know my body aging and

0:16:20.730,0:16:25.770
my aging you know but that's not again

0:16:24.360,0:16:32.520
you hurting me

0:16:25.770,0:16:36.300
that's kind of more men being there

0:16:32.520,0:16:38.360
being this very odd inverse now of all

0:16:36.300,0:16:41.430
this crazy stuff that goes on around

0:16:38.360,0:16:46.170
attraction and desire and all of that

0:16:41.430,0:16:49.880
stuff those are the things that I can

0:16:46.170,0:16:49.880
think of when I try

0:17:05.319,0:17:10.809
how do you feel about coming secondary

0:17:08.179,0:17:10.809
to the baby

0:17:20.030,0:17:27.089
and when we had our second last child

0:17:24.209,0:17:32.790
birthing class I expressed you know that

0:17:27.089,0:17:34.500
vision that I had was my nightmare was

0:17:32.790,0:17:36.990
you starting to have the baby you going

0:17:34.500,0:17:38.970
to the process of labor and screaming at

0:17:36.990,0:17:46.470
me to get out and you didn't want me

0:17:38.970,0:17:50.460
there and I guess there are two two

0:17:46.470,0:17:54.470
parts of it for me one is should there

0:17:50.460,0:17:57.840
be some kind of a physiological change

0:17:54.470,0:18:00.510
that happens from hormones and oxytocin

0:17:57.840,0:18:03.270
flooding and everything else that you

0:18:00.510,0:18:08.700
just your Center the center of your

0:18:03.270,0:18:12.929
world does in fact become this baby yeah

0:18:08.700,0:18:16.650
I'll definitely feel sad and a little

0:18:12.929,0:18:20.970
bit left out and not quite as much the

0:18:16.650,0:18:28.050
center of your world and we have been

0:18:20.970,0:18:31.170
through so much and I know that we will

0:18:28.050,0:18:36.050
get back to this maybe it's three months

0:18:31.170,0:18:38.730
maybe it's six months maybe it's a year

0:18:36.050,0:18:43.320
but we know how to climb back up this

0:18:38.730,0:18:47.059
hill and get back here and I'll do that

0:18:43.320,0:18:47.059
as many times I have to

0:18:47.450,0:18:51.860
most important person in the world

0:19:10.110,0:19:25.480
[Laughter]

0:19:15.640,0:19:27.460
we haven't needed tissues yet okay I'm

0:19:25.480,0:19:32.370
so cold I can't do cold water right now

0:19:27.460,0:19:32.370
I'm fine yeah thank you

0:19:46.130,0:19:50.180
[Laughter]

0:20:00.510,0:20:09.990
in the time we have shared together do

0:20:04.389,0:20:09.990
you have any resentments towards me no

0:20:14.519,0:20:28.539
hey the only thing I can think of is

0:20:17.080,0:20:30.490
just so much gratitude even the only

0:20:28.539,0:20:33.149
thing I can think of is it's just not

0:20:30.490,0:20:33.149
enough time

0:20:48.799,0:20:57.980
am I the best sex you've ever had yeah

0:21:02.240,0:21:06.840
one of the things that just blew me away

0:21:04.320,0:21:08.519
about you and still continues to just

0:21:06.840,0:21:11.159
blow me away about you this was

0:21:08.519,0:21:14.700
amazingly erotic and sexual you being

0:21:11.159,0:21:17.870
longer but the sexiest most profound

0:21:14.700,0:21:17.870
lover I have ever met

0:21:29.190,0:21:38.010
water it's a break here what are you

0:21:34.840,0:21:38.010
scared to tell me

0:21:51.559,0:21:59.179
I just draw such a blank I if I'm scared

0:21:57.499,0:22:00.950
of something to tell you it's kind of

0:21:59.179,0:23:26.929
like the signal that I need to tell you

0:22:00.950,0:23:38.929
something in the back of your mind are

0:23:26.929,0:23:42.350
you scared that I'll walk away no no I

0:23:38.929,0:23:46.340
think if there's one thing that over the

0:23:42.350,0:23:50.299
past ten years has really come to light

0:23:46.340,0:23:53.139
is that you and I are sitting at the

0:23:50.299,0:23:56.899
table and we're sitting at the table

0:23:53.139,0:24:01.009
we're not going anywhere but it welcomes

0:23:56.899,0:24:04.240
the table we're staying there and

0:24:01.009,0:24:08.929
whatever we have to do we're gonna do

0:24:04.240,0:24:10.700
walking away just it's nowhere in the

0:24:08.929,0:24:13.870
back of my mind the front of my mind

0:24:10.700,0:24:13.870
it's nowhere in my mind

0:24:24.210,0:24:28.670
what would make you leave me

0:24:32.410,0:24:46.900
I can't think of anything that would be

0:24:41.310,0:24:48.850
realistic of I guess if you weren't you

0:24:46.900,0:24:52.300
like if something happened where there's

0:24:48.850,0:24:56.850
like some sort of break with reality or

0:24:52.300,0:25:02.410
I don't know or something but I I just I

0:24:56.850,0:25:04.330
don't I mean I don't know I I can't

0:25:02.410,0:25:07.690
honestly think of anything I can't think

0:25:04.330,0:25:14.650
of affairs or the death of a child even

0:25:07.690,0:25:18.070
or I can't think of I can't they give

0:25:14.650,0:25:23.560
even or one of us becomes paraplegic you

0:25:18.070,0:25:27.630
know I just I can't think of anything

0:25:23.560,0:25:27.630
where that would happen

0:25:32.320,0:25:37.950
I love being with you so much it's the

0:25:34.600,0:25:37.950
most amazing part of my life

0:25:50.180,0:25:54.590
what's the biggest compromise that

0:25:52.610,0:26:02.420
you've made that I haven't acknowledged

0:25:54.590,0:26:04.870
that you haven't acknowledged biggest

0:26:02.420,0:26:04.870
compromise

0:26:19.060,0:26:22.730
right everybody this is passing is like

0:26:21.500,0:26:32.870
I don't want to answer that

0:26:22.730,0:26:35.420
this is merrily I mean honesty and being

0:26:32.870,0:26:38.990
forthright and kind of telling each

0:26:35.420,0:26:42.260
other how we feel is is a really big

0:26:38.990,0:26:47.290
part of our relationship it's why I feel

0:26:42.260,0:26:47.290
so constantly connected to you and why I

0:26:47.320,0:26:51.770
am always so excited to see you and be

0:26:50.480,0:26:58.600
with you and get to spend time with you

0:26:51.770,0:26:58.600
any chance I get and I can't think of

0:27:09.310,0:27:15.100
what have you learned about me during

0:27:12.440,0:27:15.100
this pregnancy

0:27:34.610,0:27:41.990
I'm trying to think of what I've learned

0:27:36.679,0:27:47.450
about you that's new I've been surprised

0:27:41.990,0:27:49.280
that like I've been I've been surprised

0:27:47.450,0:27:51.230
at at the fears that have come up just

0:27:49.280,0:27:54.770
that I said I may be not surprised but

0:27:51.230,0:28:01.160
that's new you know just the the Furies

0:27:54.770,0:28:04.130
of like you know how will having a baby

0:28:01.160,0:28:06.590
like displace us you know the this

0:28:04.130,0:28:14.540
nucleus like how is our Triad going to

0:28:06.590,0:28:16.130
be created that's trying to be what else

0:28:14.540,0:28:19.460
I've learned about you during this

0:28:16.130,0:28:21.380
pregnancy I feel like there's so many

0:28:19.460,0:28:24.110
things that I've depended on during this

0:28:21.380,0:28:27.520
pregnancy that just are you like you

0:28:24.110,0:28:32.570
know you know making me do my exercises

0:28:27.520,0:28:36.440
you know he needed the hell is like yeah

0:28:32.570,0:28:40.080
you know fries or something but that's

0:28:36.440,0:28:43.260
so it's also consistent with who you are

0:28:40.080,0:28:43.260
[Music]

0:28:43.480,0:28:46.880
I'm having a really hard time thinking

0:28:45.650,0:28:49.070
about what's something that I've learned

0:28:46.880,0:28:51.919
about you I feel like I'm about to learn

0:28:49.070,0:28:53.960
a lot about you as a father I feel like

0:28:51.919,0:28:55.309
it kind of feels like this has been a

0:28:53.960,0:28:57.710
little bit like this is the calm before

0:28:55.309,0:28:59.690
the storm you know like we're about to

0:28:57.710,0:29:01.910
learn a lot about each other and that

0:28:59.690,0:29:07.010
capacity but we're here to support one

0:29:01.910,0:29:11.740
another as we learn ourselves I wish I

0:29:07.010,0:29:13.880
could think of something I can't really

0:29:11.740,0:29:18.200
the thing that you're really jealous you

0:29:13.880,0:29:19.610
don't get to give birth and the crazy

0:29:18.200,0:29:21.440
totally makes heads because it's like

0:29:19.610,0:29:24.830
this peak physical experience they

0:29:21.440,0:29:25.240
you're such an extremist you could do it

0:29:24.830,0:29:27.730
you would

0:29:25.240,0:29:30.809
[Laughter]

0:29:27.730,0:29:30.809
[Music]

0:29:40.020,0:29:45.060
how do you think I'll change with this

0:29:42.790,0:29:45.060
baby

0:30:00.379,0:30:07.379
that's fine I so much of the roles that

0:30:04.169,0:30:10.830
I feel like you played for friends in

0:30:07.379,0:30:14.849
the past has had a motherly component to

0:30:10.830,0:30:16.440
it where you've helped them to see or

0:30:14.849,0:30:18.119
understand an aspect you've helped them

0:30:16.440,0:30:20.999
out in a situation you've traveled

0:30:18.119,0:30:23.099
halfway around the world to go see them

0:30:20.999,0:30:26.029
you know there's there's a very deep and

0:30:23.099,0:30:28.259
profound motherly aspect to all of the

0:30:26.029,0:30:33.960
meaningful relationships that I watch

0:30:28.259,0:30:40.349
you cultivate and so how you're going to

0:30:33.960,0:30:42.479
change I guess it doesn't feel like it's

0:30:40.349,0:30:45.929
you changing as a person so it's kind of

0:30:42.479,0:30:48.419
like I have to approach it from how is

0:30:45.929,0:30:52.919
your experience going to change in a way

0:30:48.419,0:30:56.339
that it never has been before and maybe

0:30:52.919,0:30:59.849
it's just that there won't feel like

0:30:56.339,0:31:02.549
there's a tap out you know like I I

0:30:59.849,0:31:03.690
think that might be the one thing that

0:31:02.549,0:31:07.649
seems like it's going to drastically

0:31:03.690,0:31:11.460
change is is there's you know I mean

0:31:07.649,0:31:13.049
obviously if I could like you know like

0:31:11.460,0:31:15.779
a really late night or something or

0:31:13.049,0:31:17.369
whatever and it's like dogs still need

0:31:15.779,0:31:19.440
to go out or whatever like I got your

0:31:17.369,0:31:29.099
back I got your back

0:31:19.440,0:31:31.109
always always right I mean you can't so

0:31:29.099,0:31:32.639
so it just seems like there gonna be

0:31:31.109,0:31:35.219
some aspects of this where it's like I

0:31:32.639,0:31:39.089
can't I can't I literally can't have

0:31:35.219,0:31:41.190
your back it's gotta be you and I were

0:31:39.089,0:31:42.899
so good about sharing responsibilities

0:31:41.190,0:31:47.639
whether it's dogs cleaning up house

0:31:42.899,0:31:49.739
duties whatever it is and I can't I

0:31:47.639,0:31:51.239
can't step in for a lot of this maybe we

0:31:49.739,0:31:54.029
can find out a way around it with

0:31:51.239,0:31:56.429
pumping and stuff like that but that's

0:31:54.029,0:32:00.179
you know that kind of seems like one of

0:31:56.429,0:32:02.609
the one of the biggest one of the

0:32:00.179,0:32:06.250
biggest differences is that there won't

0:32:02.609,0:32:08.640
be a tag urine kind of a thing for some

0:32:06.250,0:32:08.640
things

0:32:20.049,0:32:26.409
what do I do that detracts from our

0:32:23.659,0:32:26.409
relationship

0:32:43.730,0:32:47.210
that's another hard question for me to

0:32:45.860,0:32:49.760
answer because I don't feel like you're

0:32:47.210,0:32:51.440
doing anything that's detracting from

0:32:49.760,0:32:54.860
our relationship like I could say like

0:32:51.440,0:32:56.360
you know you're the hours that you're

0:32:54.860,0:32:59.179
putting in at work every night till 3:00

0:32:56.360,0:33:01.880
in the morning but at the same time IV

0:32:59.179,0:33:05.059
that as you're very actively trying to

0:33:01.880,0:33:08.840
add to our relationship it really like

0:33:05.059,0:33:10.429
you're so intensely focused on being

0:33:08.840,0:33:12.980
able to provide for our family that I

0:33:10.429,0:33:16.789
know that that is it's yet another thing

0:33:12.980,0:33:22.429
you're doing for us so I'm trying to

0:33:16.789,0:33:24.590
think of like what you have been so so

0:33:22.429,0:33:25.610
much in solidarity with me maybe that is

0:33:24.590,0:33:27.649
something that I can think I've been

0:33:25.610,0:33:30.649
learning about you know this pregnancy

0:33:27.649,0:33:32.690
is you really have made a statement of

0:33:30.649,0:33:34.820
being in solidarity with me during this

0:33:32.690,0:33:38.269
time of the physical changes and my own

0:33:34.820,0:33:41.179
limitations that have you know changed

0:33:38.269,0:33:43.070
and arose of being pregnant and even

0:33:41.179,0:33:46.250
like last night when I'm just done and I

0:33:43.070,0:33:48.409
just I just didn't want to go out for

0:33:46.250,0:33:50.000
the fifth night in a week even if it was

0:33:48.409,0:33:54.710
just for dinner and you stayed home with

0:33:50.000,0:33:57.019
me you know I'm trying to think of what

0:33:54.710,0:33:58.820
what you do that detracts from it and I

0:33:57.019,0:34:02.289
just feel like you're like you're so by

0:33:58.820,0:34:06.740
my side right now you've so you know

0:34:02.289,0:34:09.500
you're so by my side in in solidarity

0:34:06.740,0:34:14.690
and in a shared reality and shared

0:34:09.500,0:34:18.230
priorities and nothing sprang to mind

0:34:14.690,0:34:19.730
that that detracts and again I feel like

0:34:18.230,0:34:21.500
if there's something that arises in the

0:34:19.730,0:34:23.060
day-to-day we so quickly address that

0:34:21.500,0:34:25.310
that maybe that's why I've had

0:34:23.060,0:34:27.290
difficulty answering a lot of these like

0:34:25.310,0:34:30.139
umbrella looming questions is because we

0:34:27.290,0:34:33.740
are specifically vigilant against there

0:34:30.139,0:34:35.480
becoming an umbrella becoming a loom you

0:34:33.740,0:34:38.869
know like we've both sincerely committed

0:34:35.480,0:34:41.000
to each other to to communicate and to

0:34:38.869,0:34:42.470
breathe to press the refresh rate so

0:34:41.000,0:34:44.419
that doesn't happen because that is

0:34:42.470,0:34:50.230
dangerous that's proven to be dangerous

0:34:44.419,0:34:53.300
for us and I feel really good with where

0:34:50.230,0:34:55.890
where we are

0:34:53.300,0:34:57.710
and how are you working for us like

0:34:55.890,0:35:00.330
you're working so hard for us I just

0:34:57.710,0:35:02.970
every night you're fucking up till 3:00

0:35:00.330,0:35:21.570
or 4:00 in the morning and I feel like

0:35:02.970,0:35:34.230
I'm working - who has more power in the

0:35:21.570,0:35:38.010
relationship you or meaning that's

0:35:34.230,0:35:40.290
interesting I I guess power for me feels

0:35:38.010,0:35:42.480
of course I'm going to the definition of

0:35:40.290,0:35:48.510
power to me power feels like the ability

0:35:42.480,0:35:51.450
to influence another it's real it's

0:35:48.510,0:35:53.850
really special because I feel like one

0:35:51.450,0:35:55.620
of my biggest fears around relate long

0:35:53.850,0:35:58.010
term relationships in general is my

0:35:55.620,0:36:00.660
parents relationship where I feel like

0:35:58.010,0:36:02.820
you know my mom was the dominant figure

0:36:00.660,0:36:04.740
in the relationship my dad was

0:36:02.820,0:36:07.110
constantly succumbing and constantly

0:36:04.740,0:36:08.730
ceding his interest to make her feel

0:36:07.110,0:36:11.070
better than something that I always felt

0:36:08.730,0:36:15.720
really apprehensive about in long-term

0:36:11.070,0:36:18.180
relationships and I guess we each we

0:36:15.720,0:36:21.000
each kind of let the other know like hey

0:36:18.180,0:36:22.970
this is a big card for me this is this

0:36:21.000,0:36:28.080
is an important card for me and so you

0:36:22.970,0:36:30.990
know in situations where one of us feels

0:36:28.080,0:36:33.450
really strongly about something I feel

0:36:30.990,0:36:34.920
like we both really concede okay I see

0:36:33.450,0:36:37.320
that's a big issue for you that's that's

0:36:34.920,0:36:38.880
it's not a big deal I think you know

0:36:37.320,0:36:40.770
when we start doing with like schools of

0:36:38.880,0:36:45.810
our kid you know it's gonna get a little

0:36:40.770,0:36:50.400
bit more difficult if we if we have

0:36:45.810,0:36:52.920
contradictory viewpoints but I still

0:36:50.400,0:36:56.070
feel like we come to the table whenever

0:36:52.920,0:36:57.990
you and I are discussing something isn't

0:36:56.070,0:36:59.850
feelings based right because if it's

0:36:57.990,0:37:01.360
feelings based and it's hey this is the

0:36:59.850,0:37:03.070
way that I'm feeling and it's about

0:37:01.360,0:37:05.740
taking an opportunity to express how I

0:37:03.070,0:37:08.020
feel and feel hurt or have certain needs

0:37:05.740,0:37:09.940
met and that's that's different than a

0:37:08.020,0:37:11.620
view point a view point isn't

0:37:09.940,0:37:13.570
necessarily about feelings and it feels

0:37:11.620,0:37:17.110
like that's more where power comes in is

0:37:13.570,0:37:19.870
when I want my viewpoint to dominate or

0:37:17.110,0:37:21.940
take priority over your viewpoint I feel

0:37:19.870,0:37:24.700
like we both come to the table when we

0:37:21.940,0:37:26.470
have different viewpoints with the

0:37:24.700,0:37:29.110
understanding that I'm willing to let

0:37:26.470,0:37:31.840
this go this is just a viewpoint and

0:37:29.110,0:37:32.980
whenever we're like stuck on a viewpoint

0:37:31.840,0:37:35.110
I think we kind of bring that to each

0:37:32.980,0:37:37.120
other's attention that hey look you know

0:37:35.110,0:37:40.900
this is just a point of view this isn't

0:37:37.120,0:37:45.250
you this is just the way that you see

0:37:40.900,0:37:47.890
things and I guess I feel like that

0:37:45.250,0:37:50.560
really I I can think of so many times

0:37:47.890,0:37:52.330
where you have seated because I've felt

0:37:50.560,0:37:55.000
like that's this viewpoint or this

0:37:52.330,0:37:57.160
desire strong for me and vice versa so

0:37:55.000,0:37:58.660
it's it's really challenging to feel

0:37:57.160,0:38:00.330
like who has more power in the

0:37:58.660,0:38:04.710
relationship

0:38:00.330,0:38:04.710
it feels really balanced

0:38:14.690,0:38:19.940
what would you do if I cheated on you

0:38:20.050,0:38:26.330
[Music]

0:38:20.430,0:38:33.120
[Laughter]

0:38:26.330,0:38:36.990
well I guess I just I laugh a little bit

0:38:33.120,0:38:38.700
because it's yet another thing to you

0:38:36.990,0:38:41.220
know hey

0:38:38.700,0:38:45.750
I guess cheat in my mind is you cheat

0:38:41.220,0:38:50.430
you don't tell me you know to whatever

0:38:45.750,0:38:52.470
extent that makes sense if you come to

0:38:50.430,0:38:54.810
me and you tell me something you know

0:38:52.470,0:38:57.300
I'll tell you whatever comes up I'll

0:38:54.810,0:38:59.400
tell you if something you know if I

0:38:57.300,0:39:04.020
don't feel like a priority or I didn't

0:38:59.400,0:39:05.370
feel considered or I didn't feel I'm

0:39:04.020,0:39:13.020
disappointed you didn't talk to me about

0:39:05.370,0:39:15.480
it or hand or whatever but I guess yeah

0:39:13.020,0:39:22.290
I guess I'm having a hard time answering

0:39:15.480,0:39:26.340
because there's video cameras on I'm

0:39:22.290,0:39:31.710
fine I in a way I feel like there is no

0:39:26.340,0:39:32.850
cheat it's there's a conversation you

0:39:31.710,0:39:37.370
know and it's the courage to have a

0:39:32.850,0:39:37.370
conversation that's kind of how I feel

0:39:45.040,0:39:49.130
do you think I'm ready to be a parent

0:39:47.450,0:39:58.520
why or why not

0:39:49.130,0:40:01.070
I gonna give no one luckier on this

0:39:58.520,0:40:07.850
planet the being that gets to have you

0:40:01.070,0:40:10.310
as their mother you are so ready to be a

0:40:07.850,0:40:13.060
parent my biggest fear when you got

0:40:10.310,0:40:17.600
pregnant was here's this beautiful woman

0:40:13.060,0:40:19.760
this Austrian woman with this incredible

0:40:17.600,0:40:22.360
body and incredible everything what's

0:40:19.760,0:40:24.440
gonna happen when she gets pregnant and

0:40:22.360,0:40:26.320
that starts to change

0:40:24.440,0:40:29.090
I've heard of experiences where women

0:40:26.320,0:40:30.680
start to not like their body or take it

0:40:29.090,0:40:32.540
out on the baby and feel like this

0:40:30.680,0:40:36.560
little being is the reason that my body

0:40:32.540,0:40:38.390
has changed you embraced it you embraced

0:40:36.560,0:40:41.270
it like I feel like I've never seen a

0:40:38.390,0:40:42.860
woman embrace it then you continue to

0:40:41.270,0:40:46.420
listen to your body and and you want

0:40:42.860,0:40:49.940
this one with this amazing natural ebb

0:40:46.420,0:40:52.430
when your body started changing to the

0:40:49.940,0:40:56.630
point that you know I feel like you are

0:40:52.430,0:40:58.190
the most embracing pregnant woman I

0:40:56.630,0:41:00.710
think you said the other day I can't

0:40:58.190,0:41:02.540
imagine a woman not being able to

0:41:00.710,0:41:04.610
connect to the majesty of being pregnant

0:41:02.540,0:41:09.800
because we had heard somebody else say

0:41:04.610,0:41:15.050
it and so the question are you ready to

0:41:09.800,0:41:19.070
be a parent I mean I there's not an

0:41:15.050,0:41:22.720
aspect of it that I don't see you not

0:41:19.070,0:41:25.490
ready to embrace whether it's listening

0:41:22.720,0:41:26.960
whether it's admitting that maybe you

0:41:25.490,0:41:29.480
didn't do something quite right and

0:41:26.960,0:41:34.670
trying to do it better next time whether

0:41:29.480,0:41:37.850
it's just making sure that this child

0:41:34.670,0:41:42.020
feels so unconditionally loved and

0:41:37.850,0:41:45.200
supported there's not an aspect of

0:41:42.020,0:41:47.540
parenting that I don't feel like if you

0:41:45.200,0:41:49.700
don't already innately have inside of

0:41:47.540,0:41:56.600
your being it that you aren't ready to

0:41:49.700,0:41:59.770
just Evan flow into so yeah I think

0:41:56.600,0:41:59.770
you're ready to be a parent

0:42:16.730,0:42:21.880
what scares you the most about being a

0:42:19.700,0:42:21.880
mother

0:42:38.880,0:42:45.580
but somehow I can recreate somehow I

0:42:42.940,0:42:47.320
would be capable of recreating anything

0:42:45.580,0:42:51.790
close the dynamic that I have with my

0:42:47.320,0:42:53.710
mother and somehow you know through

0:42:51.790,0:42:55.660
whatever interaction that I could have a

0:42:53.710,0:42:58.600
child that didn't want to be close to me

0:42:55.660,0:43:02.170
when they reached adulthood when they

0:42:58.600,0:43:04.500
gained an independent mind and I'm so

0:43:02.170,0:43:08.860
ashamed about how I feel about my mom

0:43:04.500,0:43:17.530
it's so scary to think of the child that

0:43:08.860,0:43:20.550
could ever feel that way about me that

0:43:17.530,0:43:20.550
would be my biggest fear

0:43:38.730,0:43:41.800
[Music]

0:43:46.510,0:43:52.180
[Laughter]

0:43:49.380,0:44:05.859
don't have meaningful conversations this

0:43:52.180,0:44:08.740
can happen no actually it's telling if

0:44:05.859,0:44:21.280
you had a daughter what advice would you

0:44:08.740,0:44:26.380
give her regarding boys or men I would

0:44:21.280,0:44:31.240
tell her that she is the conduit of

0:44:26.380,0:44:33.339
vulnerability she has the ability it's

0:44:31.240,0:44:38.500
naturally wired in her women naturally

0:44:33.339,0:44:41.170
have this to be so deeply connected to

0:44:38.500,0:44:45.390
being vulnerable and that's something

0:44:41.170,0:44:52.119
that men so deeply need to be shown and

0:44:45.390,0:44:56.460
with that comes a great power and with

0:44:52.119,0:45:00.549
that also comes a great risk because

0:44:56.460,0:45:05.380
women who were vulnerable women who are

0:45:00.549,0:45:10.299
showing men the way can be scary and men

0:45:05.380,0:45:13.030
can do bad things and so I would ask her

0:45:10.299,0:45:17.170
and tell her to trust her intuition

0:45:13.030,0:45:21.280
about people and I would also tell her

0:45:17.170,0:45:24.730
to trust and really try to connect

0:45:21.280,0:45:30.609
people to that vulnerability of human

0:45:24.730,0:45:34.450
emotion of connection because she being

0:45:30.609,0:45:38.099
a woman is is the natural carrier she is

0:45:34.450,0:45:38.099
the conduit she is the pathway

0:45:38.790,0:45:43.170
and I could pour her with hours upon

0:45:41.280,0:45:46.560
hours of things that I would tell her

0:45:43.170,0:45:49.520
about the film and that would probably

0:45:46.560,0:45:53.750
be the one of the biggest and most

0:45:49.520,0:45:53.750
important pieces that I would tell her
