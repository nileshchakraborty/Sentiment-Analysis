0:00:00.140,0:00:19.460
3045 already we turn them up yeah all

0:00:12.389,0:00:22.470
right I'm ready okay question of the one

0:00:19.460,0:00:29.849
what do you remember about the first

0:00:22.470,0:00:31.769
time we met I remember that I was gonna

0:00:29.849,0:00:34.290
be the cool one because it just seemed

0:00:31.769,0:00:40.890
more natural and then I spilled a drink

0:00:34.290,0:00:42.690
really all right yeah I was super

0:00:40.890,0:00:44.730
garrison I did wasn't expecting to be

0:00:42.690,0:00:46.110
all right that's what I remember

0:00:44.730,0:00:47.789
I can't believe that that came to my

0:00:46.110,0:00:49.950
mind first that's not the first thing I

0:00:47.789,0:00:52.500
remember it I would not have probably

0:00:49.950,0:00:55.199
thought of that I don't know what my

0:00:52.500,0:00:57.030
answer would have I don't know I would

0:00:55.199,0:00:59.489
have been awkward it was all awkward it

0:00:57.030,0:01:01.379
was very awkward the first time you kept

0:00:59.489,0:01:02.520
saying that I keep saying that well

0:01:01.379,0:01:03.840
that's just it you kept saying it was

0:01:02.520,0:01:05.850
gonna be awkward that I'm doing this for

0:01:03.840,0:01:10.130
the drink so it was like a way oh yeah

0:01:05.850,0:01:14.250
Wow you know I'm mr. smooth I'm gonna do

0:01:10.130,0:01:17.400
Oh Oh your mind I guess it's your turn

0:01:14.250,0:01:19.549
ah what do you love about our

0:01:17.400,0:01:19.549
relationship

0:01:20.780,0:01:28.530
the I don't know so far it's just been

0:01:25.640,0:01:31.140
the ease of it more than anything

0:01:28.530,0:01:34.290
because it seems like other people I've

0:01:31.140,0:01:36.210
been with and other people you date over

0:01:34.290,0:01:41.070
the course of your life it's just kind

0:01:36.210,0:01:43.380
of like so much goddamn work yeah like

0:01:41.070,0:01:46.350
you know and you don't feel like you can

0:01:43.380,0:01:47.520
be yourself and you don't feel like you

0:01:46.350,0:01:49.590
know you kind of feel like you have to

0:01:47.520,0:01:51.680
play a game a little bit and I don't

0:01:49.590,0:01:54.030
feel like I'm necessarily playing games

0:01:51.680,0:01:56.430
unless I'm playing games but then it's

0:01:54.030,0:02:00.900
kind of been put out there like we're

0:01:56.430,0:02:07.620
just fucking around right now yeah

0:02:00.900,0:02:11.340
oh when do you feel closest to me

0:02:07.620,0:02:21.090
they're closest to me when do we feel

0:02:11.340,0:02:24.690
close when do you feel closest this is

0:02:21.090,0:02:27.000
really weird too but I feel like when I

0:02:24.690,0:02:29.880
do something like work out and tell you

0:02:27.000,0:02:31.560
about it or have a hard day and tell you

0:02:29.880,0:02:33.210
about it cuz there's no one else in my

0:02:31.560,0:02:34.470
life like I talked about my mom and

0:02:33.210,0:02:38.070
mm-hmm

0:02:34.470,0:02:40.470
I talk about my family I talk about okay

0:02:38.070,0:02:41.760
trips and all that with my friends but

0:02:40.470,0:02:46.650
you're the only one I talk about like my

0:02:41.760,0:02:47.970
name I had a hard workout so stupid no

0:02:46.650,0:02:49.560
but do you feel close to me when you

0:02:47.970,0:02:50.970
tell me about it do you feel close to me

0:02:49.560,0:02:53.190
when we're going through it

0:02:50.970,0:02:54.840
no and I'm telling you about it like I

0:02:53.190,0:02:56.940
find myself wanting to call you and tell

0:02:54.840,0:03:00.900
you about it and then I afterward I

0:02:56.940,0:03:02.610
think okay that was I think that's when

0:03:00.900,0:03:05.700
I started knowing that it was like oh

0:03:02.610,0:03:07.110
this might be when you could complain to

0:03:05.700,0:03:11.880
me about your day okay

0:03:07.110,0:03:13.260
no I agreed agreed no it's good I mean

0:03:11.880,0:03:14.459
no they've been right now I feel really

0:03:13.260,0:03:17.489
close to you right yeah we have the

0:03:14.459,0:03:18.989
table looks fine it's like a jailhouse I

0:03:17.489,0:03:20.880
feel like I've done something well we

0:03:18.989,0:03:23.340
should have like a should be on the

0:03:20.880,0:03:27.330
phone yeah oh I'm sorry I think right

0:03:23.340,0:03:30.920
yeah hmm ooh you ready for this

0:03:27.330,0:03:34.350
I guess what are you hesitant to tell me

0:03:30.920,0:03:39.420
what am i hesitant to tell you right now

0:03:34.350,0:03:44.400
or ever ever I'm gonna go ahead and make

0:03:39.420,0:03:49.140
that call hmm I don't know it's always

0:03:44.400,0:03:53.700
difficult to tell you difficult if not

0:03:49.140,0:03:57.989
impossible to tell you if something that

0:03:53.700,0:04:00.030
you've done has bothered me like what

0:03:57.989,0:04:02.100
that might be me it might not be you

0:04:00.030,0:04:04.650
everything might be my perception of you

0:04:02.100,0:04:07.950
I can't think of one right off the top

0:04:04.650,0:04:09.810
of my dresser a little bit a little bit

0:04:07.950,0:04:13.560
let's be honest this is all about

0:04:09.810,0:04:14.510
honesty I think that sometimes you'll do

0:04:13.560,0:04:18.079
something and I'll be like

0:04:14.510,0:04:20.600
oh I don't agree with that but it's not

0:04:18.079,0:04:23.210
worth it for me to have that

0:04:20.600,0:04:24.770
conversation because it's usually not

0:04:23.210,0:04:26.479
anything big it's usually not anything

0:04:24.770,0:04:28.550
that I need to have a conversation about

0:04:26.479,0:04:30.889
it's like usually slept like shouldn't

0:04:28.550,0:04:34.850
just let that go kid is it my only child

0:04:30.889,0:04:37.460
maybe maybe I don't want to analyze you

0:04:34.850,0:04:38.960
but yeah but and then it could just be

0:04:37.460,0:04:40.970
me it could be my perception of whatever

0:04:38.960,0:04:42.080
it is and maybe I'm the wrong one and

0:04:40.970,0:04:43.430
then I don't want to have that

0:04:42.080,0:04:46.810
conversation either you know because

0:04:43.430,0:04:51.590
maybe I'm overreacting okay that's it

0:04:46.810,0:04:53.479
make sense huh okay good we're not

0:04:51.590,0:04:57.229
giving him surprises out here this is a

0:04:53.479,0:04:59.930
oh and leading into that tell me about

0:04:57.229,0:05:02.780
the time I disappointed you and how do

0:04:59.930,0:05:06.260
you feel about it now as if there were

0:05:02.780,0:05:08.600
just one time I don't actually I have to

0:05:06.260,0:05:11.750
be really on it mm-hmm this is a little

0:05:08.600,0:05:14.870
deep preaching like we're the only ones

0:05:11.750,0:05:17.449
here okay I think I've been disappointed

0:05:14.870,0:05:20.210
by so many people in my life but the

0:05:17.449,0:05:22.669
fact that you have so rarely like is

0:05:20.210,0:05:24.830
huge it makes me feel even more trusting

0:05:22.669,0:05:26.570
of you so I know that's not the answer

0:05:24.830,0:05:30.289
to the question but I'm gonna lead with

0:05:26.570,0:05:32.210
that having said that I think the

0:05:30.289,0:05:34.070
disappointment that I've ever felt with

0:05:32.210,0:05:37.370
you I've ever I think I've expressed

0:05:34.070,0:05:40.190
like and it's always really stupid stuff

0:05:37.370,0:05:41.960
right well I can't agree to that right

0:05:40.190,0:05:44.840
sure at the moment it's the most simple

0:05:41.960,0:05:46.789
well no like I've had a really long day

0:05:44.840,0:05:50.330
of making decisions which we obviously

0:05:46.789,0:05:52.400
talked about and I just want you to pick

0:05:50.330,0:05:54.860
where you go to dinner and the answer is

0:05:52.400,0:05:58.750
no I know that's so stupid but that's

0:05:54.860,0:06:01.460
the biggest disappointment you've caused

0:05:58.750,0:06:03.680
okay don't feel very disappointed with

0:06:01.460,0:06:05.870
you in general I'll take it we're not

0:06:03.680,0:06:10.190
very far I mean nine months then I guess

0:06:05.870,0:06:12.289
you have a little you have time but time

0:06:10.190,0:06:15.500
I can make so many more mistakes thank

0:06:12.289,0:06:17.380
you thank you yeah okay I'll pick where

0:06:15.500,0:06:20.830
we're gonna

0:06:17.380,0:06:25.060
I know it is but it is it was ooh

0:06:20.830,0:06:28.540
do we have enough sex enough sex is

0:06:25.060,0:06:31.000
there ever an upset um I don't feel like

0:06:28.540,0:06:32.460
I'm missing out I don't know but I don't

0:06:31.000,0:06:34.780
feel like I'm missing out on anything

0:06:32.460,0:06:37.390
there there aren't necessarily times

0:06:34.780,0:06:40.660
where I'm like damn it if only we had

0:06:37.390,0:06:43.630
had sex I think that you know and taking

0:06:40.660,0:06:46.360
the long view there's gonna be plenty of

0:06:43.630,0:06:48.580
opportunity for me to screw up and for

0:06:46.360,0:06:50.740
us to have sex for me to screw up - Wow

0:06:48.580,0:06:53.740
and for you to have sex and for me to

0:06:50.740,0:06:57.070
say no to sex I've never done you're

0:06:53.740,0:06:57.550
allowed to though you're allowed to do

0:06:57.070,0:06:59.920
that

0:06:57.550,0:07:04.150
it sounds some patriarchal thing where

0:06:59.920,0:07:07.360
it's like it could be better romance now

0:07:04.150,0:07:09.190
what could be sometimes I know that's a

0:07:07.360,0:07:12.090
bit let's see that's a mixed message I

0:07:09.190,0:07:15.550
know I don't know sometimes you you know

0:07:12.090,0:07:17.200
I'm expected to take the lead ie picking

0:07:15.550,0:07:19.950
where we eat for dinner but sometimes

0:07:17.200,0:07:22.720
you might not want to have chicken and I

0:07:19.950,0:07:27.310
thanks their dinner both there were two

0:07:22.720,0:07:29.410
tandem questions but yeah I think I'm

0:07:27.310,0:07:31.030
fine with the amount of sex that I have

0:07:29.410,0:07:34.870
I mean there could be more there could

0:07:31.030,0:07:37.870
be less I I'm not dissatisfied in any

0:07:34.870,0:07:40.570
regard okay yeah okay

0:07:37.870,0:07:43.050
it's all very good on that note that

0:07:40.570,0:07:46.990
abundantly clear all is well enough Oh

0:07:43.050,0:07:48.670
am I the best sex you've ever had I have

0:07:46.990,0:07:53.170
to be honest and say yes well we talked

0:07:48.670,0:07:55.150
about it before yeah no agree yes yeah

0:07:53.170,0:07:57.910
thanks listen I don't even feel like I

0:07:55.150,0:08:01.240
have to speak further about it because

0:07:57.910,0:08:03.430
there's like no comparison I do think

0:08:01.240,0:08:04.690
it's the connection which this is gonna

0:08:03.430,0:08:07.630
look away two years ago

0:08:04.690,0:08:08.530
I know forever somewhere joy two years

0:08:07.630,0:08:10.210
ago would have been like all the

0:08:08.530,0:08:12.430
connection has nothing to do with this

0:08:10.210,0:08:16.270
but I think you've proven that wrong

0:08:12.430,0:08:19.120
yeah yeah well it's not just me you are

0:08:16.270,0:08:23.140
a part of it I know yeah a large part

0:08:19.120,0:08:24.950
some would say more than 13% well some

0:08:23.140,0:08:27.560
nights it no

0:08:24.950,0:08:33.200
just kidding sure we thought you could

0:08:27.560,0:08:35.750
we keep going I was just you know 6040

0:08:33.200,0:08:41.539
you have to be honest for this okay

0:08:35.750,0:08:42.890
where do you think I may fail you I know

0:08:41.539,0:08:44.570
it's a hard one to deal with because

0:08:42.890,0:08:48.020
I've never thought about that I've only

0:08:44.570,0:08:49.880
thought of where I would screw up my

0:08:48.020,0:08:51.230
anxiety is more from like where I would

0:08:49.880,0:08:59.420
screw up rather than where you would

0:08:51.230,0:09:01.400
screw up I don't know a guy okay I'm

0:08:59.420,0:09:05.030
gonna have an add to it so I don't know

0:09:01.400,0:09:11.840
are we allowed to add cheese yeah well

0:09:05.030,0:09:13.990
take you go ahead like without comparing

0:09:11.840,0:09:16.400
me like specifically like in the past

0:09:13.990,0:09:20.090
what didn't work that maybe you're

0:09:16.400,0:09:22.460
worried might not work again it just

0:09:20.090,0:09:24.470
goes back to me I bet I think at some

0:09:22.460,0:09:26.060
point you're gonna you know maybe you're

0:09:24.470,0:09:32.350
gonna get sick having me around all the

0:09:26.060,0:09:35.840
time I don't know so I cannot fail um

0:09:32.350,0:09:37.520
you know you could be mean to people you

0:09:35.840,0:09:39.230
know you could be not welcoming to

0:09:37.520,0:09:42.260
friends and whatever but so far you've

0:09:39.230,0:09:43.250
been good okay I don't I can't think of

0:09:42.260,0:09:46.160
I mean

0:09:43.250,0:09:50.060
fail is such a deep like you have failed

0:09:46.160,0:09:51.440
me is so I mean disappointed but I can't

0:09:50.060,0:09:55.190
even think of a time where you've

0:09:51.440,0:09:58.190
disappointed me necessarily but fail you

0:09:55.190,0:10:00.290
you know I feel like if I had some

0:09:58.190,0:10:02.240
illness you would stick around I feel

0:10:00.290,0:10:06.200
like if there was some catastrophe or

0:10:02.240,0:10:09.860
some you know economic upheaval that you

0:10:06.200,0:10:11.510
would be okay or at least we'd find a

0:10:09.860,0:10:15.050
way I feel like we just find a way to

0:10:11.510,0:10:16.460
work things out okay yeah where things

0:10:15.050,0:10:18.410
would just work out because I feel like

0:10:16.460,0:10:21.380
so far in the nine months or however

0:10:18.410,0:10:23.540
long it's been it's like things have

0:10:21.380,0:10:24.710
pretty much fallen into place I feel

0:10:23.540,0:10:26.960
like I haven't really again it goes back

0:10:24.710,0:10:31.250
to not having to work all that hard yeah

0:10:26.960,0:10:34.710
I feel like powerful forces have come to

0:10:31.250,0:10:39.300
my aid you know so yeah

0:10:34.710,0:10:49.920
as weird as that sounds how do I take

0:10:39.300,0:10:52.940
you for granted I actually don't think

0:10:49.920,0:10:55.370
you do you do a really good job of not

0:10:52.940,0:11:02.640
taking me for granted

0:10:55.370,0:11:04.260
okay I think I don't know dumb but again

0:11:02.640,0:11:06.930
it could be that it hasn't I don't know

0:11:04.260,0:11:08.010
I don't feel taken for granted ever well

0:11:06.930,0:11:10.470
what if like you know like what about

0:11:08.010,0:11:12.300
not responding to your friends emails is

0:11:10.470,0:11:14.450
that me take you for granted is that

0:11:12.300,0:11:16.500
taking in a relationship for granted I

0:11:14.450,0:11:19.580
think that believe me I'm not fishing

0:11:16.500,0:11:22.770
for things I think that's taking their

0:11:19.580,0:11:26.070
comfort and like like their comfort with

0:11:22.770,0:11:27.750
you and they're your likability to them

0:11:26.070,0:11:29.190
for grant I don't think it has to do

0:11:27.750,0:11:31.800
with me I think that's part of I think

0:11:29.190,0:11:34.590
that's been my problem if you if they

0:11:31.800,0:11:40.740
took the time to reach out to you and

0:11:34.590,0:11:42.480
invite you to third party I've always

0:11:40.740,0:11:44.160
been under the assumption that they just

0:11:42.480,0:11:45.930
assumed that if you were going that I

0:11:44.160,0:11:48.270
was going to go to right and but they

0:11:45.930,0:11:51.360
didn't say joy plus wine which they have

0:11:48.270,0:11:53.420
right but now they know I get it I'm

0:11:51.360,0:11:56.070
saying that it might be an example yeah

0:11:53.420,0:11:57.690
me for maybe taking them for you know

0:11:56.070,0:11:59.460
maybe I did taking me for granted or

0:11:57.690,0:12:02.790
taking us for granted there's such a

0:11:59.460,0:12:06.510
thing as taking yeah you take it for

0:12:02.790,0:12:12.030
granted that I'm whither thou goest

0:12:06.510,0:12:15.150
cause die you have to remember they knew

0:12:12.030,0:12:17.060
me first thing go way longer right and

0:12:15.150,0:12:20.880
you were miserable horribly miserably

0:12:17.060,0:12:29.250
that's the story I've saved your life

0:12:20.880,0:12:31.260
I'm apparently sliced bread I know are

0:12:29.250,0:12:33.840
you okay with me sleeping with other

0:12:31.260,0:12:37.170
people no I mean other you've slept with

0:12:33.840,0:12:39.510
other people before me but and I'm you

0:12:37.170,0:12:43.020
know God knows we've both been around

0:12:39.510,0:12:45.990
the bend but not now well we had this

0:12:43.020,0:12:48.480
conversation that it wasn't what

0:12:45.990,0:12:51.210
I don't necessarily believe that we

0:12:48.480,0:12:52.620
agreed with the monogamy thing yeah I

0:12:51.210,0:12:54.240
have to say I mean that I think that's

0:12:52.620,0:12:56.460
the way you have to do it I mean I don't

0:12:54.240,0:12:59.610
want to sound judgmental but you know

0:12:56.460,0:13:02.340
like I feel like if you're more that you

0:12:59.610,0:13:04.950
do it with me someone's having a problem

0:13:02.340,0:13:07.410
I think if there's a three thing going

0:13:04.950,0:13:08.880
on it's there's always one person who's

0:13:07.410,0:13:13.500
getting these three in the bed

0:13:08.880,0:13:14.850
whatever yeah not three together but I'm

0:13:13.500,0:13:17.520
saying anytime you bring somebody else

0:13:14.850,0:13:19.620
in to like a couple I think it's

0:13:17.520,0:13:21.390
somebody out of those three people is

0:13:19.620,0:13:24.450
getting not what they're not being

0:13:21.390,0:13:26.940
served it I just feel like if I'm one of

0:13:24.450,0:13:29.670
the three it's not gonna work I can't

0:13:26.940,0:13:32.160
say that for other people I feel like I

0:13:29.670,0:13:33.210
can I feel like I can say that if there

0:13:32.160,0:13:34.410
are three people that are in a

0:13:33.210,0:13:36.330
relationship and even though they've

0:13:34.410,0:13:38.460
discussed it yeah and said this is what

0:13:36.330,0:13:41.160
we're gonna do and we can make this work

0:13:38.460,0:13:42.540
I think some of the one that one person

0:13:41.160,0:13:45.270
of that three isn't being honest with

0:13:42.540,0:13:48.180
the other two or somebody's disappointed

0:13:45.270,0:13:49.950
so this is a conversation I'm gonna add

0:13:48.180,0:13:52.860
to this chair so what if something like

0:13:49.950,0:13:57.920
happens like like we were talking about

0:13:52.860,0:13:57.920
last night if you've been to the Amazon

0:14:01.040,0:14:08.040
it's a true thing I just read a book but

0:14:05.310,0:14:09.570
it was a David Beckham had to get like

0:14:08.040,0:14:12.330
extra insurance cuz he was going to the

0:14:09.570,0:14:14.370
Amazon and there's microscopic fish that

0:14:12.330,0:14:19.170
will fly up yours yeah and oh you either

0:14:14.370,0:14:19.560
die or they came to me right being alike

0:14:19.170,0:14:21.210
to me

0:14:19.560,0:14:23.220
whatever it's called I don't ever want

0:14:21.210,0:14:24.450
to hear those words okay that's not a

0:14:23.220,0:14:26.790
choice I don't want that to be a choice

0:14:24.450,0:14:30.210
I all I said was I'm afraid to go to the

0:14:26.790,0:14:32.550
Amazon for that reason but you're saying

0:14:30.210,0:14:35.310
if that were to happen and you were to

0:14:32.550,0:14:37.560
find some solace sexually elsewhere I

0:14:35.310,0:14:40.740
don't know that's a weird situation and

0:14:37.560,0:14:42.840
I can't imagine that I would but cuz

0:14:40.740,0:14:46.500
it's not like you know I could do it I

0:14:42.840,0:14:48.420
mean you know it's just a weird creepy

0:14:46.500,0:14:50.790
thing yeah okay well I don't want to so

0:14:48.420,0:14:52.800
I think we're good but all right well we

0:14:50.790,0:14:57.030
could talk about it just know that I

0:14:52.800,0:14:58.140
don't think that you know I also wonder

0:14:57.030,0:14:59.209
like if somebody gets into a situation

0:14:58.140,0:15:01.939
with like so

0:14:59.209,0:15:04.220
he was married that's like have you

0:15:01.939,0:15:06.860
never seen a television show or read a

0:15:04.220,0:15:10.939
book or seen a movie it never it never

0:15:06.860,0:15:13.149
works out the Shonda Rhimes Oh what

0:15:10.939,0:15:16.249
would you do if I cheated on you

0:15:13.149,0:15:23.059
assuming it's already been done what

0:15:16.249,0:15:27.499
would I do I think that's all for me for

0:15:23.059,0:15:30.920
me okay go ahead for me I think it

0:15:27.499,0:15:32.089
depends on is it an emotional thing is

0:15:30.920,0:15:35.629
it just a physical

0:15:32.089,0:15:39.259
I know I know roll your eyes I I really

0:15:35.629,0:15:41.420
do like if you're absolutely madly in

0:15:39.259,0:15:44.149
love with somebody that you have to have

0:15:41.420,0:15:47.389
sex with them and but you don't want to

0:15:44.149,0:15:49.490
lose me I think that's unfair and I

0:15:47.389,0:15:52.490
would end it I think if you went on a

0:15:49.490,0:15:55.910
business trip and had too much to drink

0:15:52.490,0:15:56.839
and screwed up I'd be pissed right I

0:15:55.910,0:16:04.999
wouldn't want you going on a business

0:15:56.839,0:16:08.240
trip with said woman or man again but I

0:16:04.999,0:16:13.220
don't know I don't I I guess I don't put

0:16:08.240,0:16:17.059
that much stock in the physical cheating

0:16:13.220,0:16:19.790
so if that's what it means then okay but

0:16:17.059,0:16:23.269
don't do it let's not try it I wouldn't

0:16:19.790,0:16:26.929
know I don't believe okay I'm okay with

0:16:23.269,0:16:31.029
not doing it I you know point taken what

0:16:26.929,0:16:35.899
is missing from our relationship missing

0:16:31.029,0:16:37.970
I feel like we've only just gotten

0:16:35.899,0:16:41.299
gotten started I think we're still in

0:16:37.970,0:16:45.670
there like not the honeymoon phase

0:16:41.299,0:16:47.990
because it's silly but like I think I

0:16:45.670,0:16:50.720
know it's easy to say I don't feel like

0:16:47.990,0:16:52.790
I'm missing anything but I guess the

0:16:50.720,0:16:55.790
only thing we're missing as a couple or

0:16:52.790,0:16:57.709
in a relationship is further experiences

0:16:55.790,0:16:58.230
that makes sense like you know you

0:16:57.709,0:17:00.360
haven't live

0:16:58.230,0:17:03.960
together that would be something you

0:17:00.360,0:17:06.510
know we haven't gone through like a

0:17:03.960,0:17:10.560
death there's something together thank

0:17:06.510,0:17:12.300
God you know I just feel like there's if

0:17:10.560,0:17:14.790
anything's nothing's missing right now

0:17:12.300,0:17:16.410
day to day I don't feel like I don't

0:17:14.790,0:17:20.340
feel like we don't have any trust or any

0:17:16.410,0:17:22.320
of that stuff I feel like I can't I

0:17:20.340,0:17:25.680
don't know because we haven't had the

0:17:22.320,0:17:30.000
whole breadth of experience yet okay I

0:17:25.680,0:17:33.360
think I agree now that I need any of

0:17:30.000,0:17:36.170
those experiences what do you think is

0:17:33.360,0:17:39.090
the next step in our relationship

0:17:36.170,0:17:42.030
going to Mexico next week well I know

0:17:39.090,0:17:47.280
you're obsessed with knowing it's gonna

0:17:42.030,0:17:48.690
happen Wow yeah I what's the next step

0:17:47.280,0:17:50.280
in our relationship I think the next

0:17:48.690,0:17:53.100
step is not tomorrow but I think the

0:17:50.280,0:17:55.170
next step is do we want to move in

0:17:53.100,0:17:58.200
together and we've already talked about

0:17:55.170,0:18:01.680
it and mm-hmm when is the right time and

0:17:58.200,0:18:03.480
where is the right place and logistics

0:18:01.680,0:18:06.840
work I think that's the next time okay

0:18:03.480,0:18:10.140
it probably is yeah I don't really have

0:18:06.840,0:18:11.370
a list right that's okay you always have

0:18:10.140,0:18:13.350
a list but I think that might be the

0:18:11.370,0:18:16.860
next thing on the list you asked that

0:18:13.350,0:18:19.590
one right yeah yeah what are you scared

0:18:16.860,0:18:23.610
to tell me not hesitant that was earlier

0:18:19.590,0:18:27.380
are you scared to tell me I don't feel

0:18:23.610,0:18:27.380
like I have any deep dark secrets I

0:18:28.730,0:18:32.370
can't think of anything that I would

0:18:30.600,0:18:34.080
would be afraid to tell you

0:18:32.370,0:18:36.330
I mean well there I'm sure that you know

0:18:34.080,0:18:37.920
there would be hard conversations like

0:18:36.330,0:18:43.760
I'd hate to have to come home and say

0:18:37.920,0:18:45.690
you know I lost my job or you know I'm I

0:18:43.760,0:18:47.880
don't know I hope that wouldn't be

0:18:45.690,0:18:49.800
because of me I'm not saying because of

0:18:47.880,0:18:52.590
you but I'd still be afraid to tell you

0:18:49.800,0:18:56.270
because it's just you know I don't need

0:18:52.590,0:18:59.370
that in my life like any kind of

0:18:56.270,0:19:05.490
catastrophe I would feel bad I'm telling

0:18:59.370,0:19:08.550
you in terms of fears I think my it's

0:19:05.490,0:19:11.670
gonna be horrible just gonna tell you

0:19:08.550,0:19:13.530
a fear that I have had which is gonna be

0:19:11.670,0:19:15.510
horrible for you but probably silly for

0:19:13.530,0:19:17.850
people watching this is that at some

0:19:15.510,0:19:21.390
point you're not going to be there and I

0:19:17.850,0:19:25.140
will be there and your gun will die my

0:19:21.390,0:19:26.790
job yes and I will have to tell you that

0:19:25.140,0:19:28.860
she died because you will think that I

0:19:26.790,0:19:31.740
did do you think I'm gonna be at work I

0:19:28.860,0:19:32.970
feel like sometimes I'm gonna be there

0:19:31.740,0:19:35.550
when it happens

0:19:32.970,0:19:39.720
and I'm gonna have to be the one to tell

0:19:35.550,0:19:41.580
you that's interesting oh because I have

0:19:39.720,0:19:45.900
such clear visions of what's gonna

0:19:41.580,0:19:46.290
happen when she died - we sound really

0:19:45.900,0:19:48.540
morbid

0:19:46.290,0:19:51.330
but really do you know it's supposed to

0:19:48.540,0:19:53.250
be yeah it is she's an old dog I'm just

0:19:51.330,0:19:55.320
saying it could happen I know and I

0:19:53.250,0:19:56.940
desperately don't want it to happen when

0:19:55.320,0:19:57.900
I'm there and you're not I wouldn't

0:19:56.940,0:20:00.690
think you did it

0:19:57.900,0:20:04.290
I would feel a good thing somehow you

0:20:00.690,0:20:08.160
wouldn't say it but somehow you would

0:20:04.290,0:20:10.740
say did you feed her today did she need

0:20:08.160,0:20:11.880
something somehow I'm we're talking

0:20:10.740,0:20:13.830
about beers we're talking about beers

0:20:11.880,0:20:17.280
and this is the only one that I actively

0:20:13.830,0:20:18.510
had okay you know not every time but

0:20:17.280,0:20:21.030
like sometimes you go to get like a

0:20:18.510,0:20:23.910
pedicure or something and I'm there and

0:20:21.030,0:20:25.830
I check in with her make sure she's okay

0:20:23.910,0:20:27.120
sometimes in the morning before I leave

0:20:25.830,0:20:29.300
through work I like to make sure that

0:20:27.120,0:20:32.310
her chest is rising and falling okay

0:20:29.300,0:20:38.220
partly because I've I gotta get to work

0:20:32.310,0:20:41.580
I don't have time to do that I'm just

0:20:38.220,0:20:45.420
being honest was that yours or mine that

0:20:41.580,0:20:51.570
was I asked you okay but wishing that

0:20:45.420,0:20:52.890
again you will be irrational about it

0:20:51.570,0:20:55.500
you don't think you are now cuz you've

0:20:52.890,0:20:57.000
got this no I have a plan I know how

0:20:55.500,0:21:01.050
it's gonna or not everything is gonna

0:20:57.000,0:21:05.250
work out according to plan I think is my

0:21:01.050,0:21:07.340
fear in the back of your mind

0:21:05.250,0:21:14.610
are you scared that I'll walk away

0:21:07.340,0:21:17.250
always why the why I know it's why do

0:21:14.610,0:21:19.610
you think I would do that um everybody

0:21:17.250,0:21:19.610
does

0:21:20.619,0:21:23.619
Wow

0:21:24.519,0:21:35.659
how much time do you have right um no I

0:21:28.099,0:21:37.309
mean I think there are three people in

0:21:35.659,0:21:41.239
my life that I know or not I can ever

0:21:37.309,0:21:44.629
walk away and it took them years to get

0:21:41.239,0:21:48.199
there it took them years to earn that or

0:21:44.629,0:21:49.690
it took you years to realize it I think

0:21:48.199,0:21:52.669
it goes hand in hand

0:21:49.690,0:21:56.419
Noby and so I think as short as we are

0:21:52.669,0:21:58.759
into it I you haven't quite like died

0:21:56.419,0:22:00.319
out you haven't proven yet nothing

0:21:58.759,0:22:03.139
there's nothing to prove nothing you're

0:22:00.319,0:22:06.289
tested but well if these other three

0:22:03.139,0:22:09.169
people have been tested and won or have

0:22:06.289,0:22:10.639
been not found to be lacking mm-hmm I'm

0:22:09.169,0:22:14.329
wondering if they knew that they were in

0:22:10.639,0:22:17.779
the process of being tested or if it was

0:22:14.329,0:22:20.329
just all internally with you and when do

0:22:17.779,0:22:21.769
you know and was it something that they

0:22:20.329,0:22:24.169
did that they were aware that they did

0:22:21.769,0:22:27.049
to get there did you say okay well they

0:22:24.169,0:22:30.049
did it I'm just wondering how long I

0:22:27.049,0:22:33.019
have to work welp Jane okay yeah she did

0:22:30.049,0:22:35.239
stuff when I was a teenager that made me

0:22:33.019,0:22:37.969
go oh she's not going anywhere

0:22:35.239,0:22:42.049
okay Celebes been there through

0:22:37.969,0:22:46.489
everything right and I understand I

0:22:42.049,0:22:52.159
don't know I think I need 25 years and

0:22:46.489,0:22:56.869
then Katie who we're just like one we're

0:22:52.159,0:22:58.669
like okay so with her we went through

0:22:56.869,0:23:00.139
major life changes at the same time and

0:22:58.669,0:23:02.049
it just sort of happened that I was like

0:23:00.139,0:23:05.269
oh she she's never gonna go away

0:23:02.049,0:23:07.940
okay okay I'm glad for but but as I'm

0:23:05.269,0:23:09.679
saying is no length of association yeah

0:23:07.940,0:23:13.249
I guess it's like having been through

0:23:09.679,0:23:17.209
life experiences that they didn't run

0:23:13.249,0:23:19.459
and we just haven't had this yet but at

0:23:17.209,0:23:20.869
this point right now I mean you think

0:23:19.459,0:23:22.789
that if something should come up I'm

0:23:20.869,0:23:24.769
gonna kind of bait and go

0:23:22.789,0:23:27.769
I feel more comfortable than I have with

0:23:24.769,0:23:29.059
anybody else okay but do you think it

0:23:27.769,0:23:30.829
would need something like that there

0:23:29.059,0:23:32.149
have to be an impetus for me to go it's

0:23:30.829,0:23:32.440
not like I'm just gonna say well I'm

0:23:32.149,0:23:34.260
going

0:23:32.440,0:23:40.290
for a pack of smokes that's not good

0:23:34.260,0:23:40.290
because it's a 1960s TV no for a Becca

0:23:42.090,0:23:48.610
good for you

0:23:44.800,0:23:58.030
no I think it's I think it's just I

0:23:48.610,0:24:02.680
think it's just time I think I asked you

0:23:58.030,0:24:07.210
that yeah yeah who would struggle more

0:24:02.680,0:24:10.660
if we broke up I feel I would hate I

0:24:07.210,0:24:14.040
just feel like I would I feel like you

0:24:10.660,0:24:16.600
have like such a support group around

0:24:14.040,0:24:18.790
you that would be like it's alright he

0:24:16.600,0:24:21.280
was a jerk blah blah whatever happened

0:24:18.790,0:24:22.660
they would understand whatever I feel

0:24:21.280,0:24:26.530
like you would have people around you

0:24:22.660,0:24:28.180
okay to help you through it you would I

0:24:26.530,0:24:33.700
would have people telling me how dumb I

0:24:28.180,0:24:35.320
was oh yeah you screwed up I may be I

0:24:33.700,0:24:36.340
think I have my friends would say what

0:24:35.320,0:24:39.730
did you do okay

0:24:36.340,0:24:43.420
yeah and then I feel I would just you

0:24:39.730,0:24:46.180
know fall into myself you know yes just

0:24:43.420,0:24:50.440
grow the giant beard and you know just

0:24:46.180,0:24:52.720
be sad all the time yeah mm-hmm I mean

0:24:50.440,0:24:55.290
it could be you I think it seemed to me

0:24:52.720,0:24:55.290
it would be me

0:24:59.900,0:25:07.490
hmm which one of my friends have you

0:25:03.930,0:25:10.710
slept with I mean would you sleep with

0:25:07.490,0:25:14.160
have I slept with I don't think anybody

0:25:10.710,0:25:16.080
haven't there's I Jersey there's a

0:25:14.160,0:25:19.590
little piece of me that's like not that

0:25:16.080,0:25:23.370
I've been with the world but we do have

0:25:19.590,0:25:24.960
some mutual friends like I don't think

0:25:23.370,0:25:26.460
it would be one of your best friends but

0:25:24.960,0:25:28.710
there are a couple of times that I'm

0:25:26.460,0:25:33.420
like I wonder if he knows that person

0:25:28.710,0:25:38.220
from all right who would you sleep with

0:25:33.420,0:25:41.040
that was the second part never metal is

0:25:38.220,0:25:45.800
mad enough of them in now but the one

0:25:41.040,0:25:45.800
guys that are the straight guys that I

0:25:47.630,0:25:52.800
don't really know you just don't want to

0:25:50.520,0:25:54.960
say in today's no I really don't I don't

0:25:52.800,0:25:57.900
I mean Riven but you haven't met I've

0:25:54.960,0:26:01.640
met female friends I've met coworkers

0:25:57.900,0:26:07.370
I've met three guys that I would never

0:26:01.640,0:26:07.370
consider wrong with my friends like

0:26:08.180,0:26:15.630
maybe like no I can't even okay I guess

0:26:13.590,0:26:17.520
nobody I can't picture it myself so

0:26:15.630,0:26:19.830
don't feel bad I wouldn't want to sleep

0:26:17.520,0:26:22.500
with any of them there are stories I've

0:26:19.830,0:26:25.170
heard from fraternity days that I can

0:26:22.500,0:26:26.100
see if I were in college and we were in

0:26:25.170,0:26:28.260
college together

0:26:26.100,0:26:30.240
then I would have gone for that frat guy

0:26:28.260,0:26:33.570
but I don't know him I've never met him

0:26:30.240,0:26:35.610
I probably never will okay like I can

0:26:33.570,0:26:40.770
think about the kind of guy I would have

0:26:35.610,0:26:47.940
gone for definitely well now and not go

0:26:40.770,0:26:50.460
to that weekend this year it's curious

0:26:47.940,0:26:52.980
is Tikku I don't even know the names I

0:26:50.460,0:26:54.090
can like put the story with it but it's

0:26:52.980,0:26:58.080
alright it's alright

0:26:54.090,0:26:59.820
again like 20 years ago sir um what do

0:26:58.080,0:27:02.870
you think you would find if you went

0:26:59.820,0:27:02.870
through my phone right now

0:27:05.970,0:27:15.090
a lot of texts back and forth between

0:27:11.250,0:27:17.670
your people yeah I don't think my people

0:27:15.090,0:27:20.160
what do you like your texts bullshit

0:27:17.670,0:27:21.870
there's gonna be like a lot of that you

0:27:20.160,0:27:24.600
know just back and forth with other

0:27:21.870,0:27:26.490
folks but I don't know that there's

0:27:24.600,0:27:29.730
anything untoward that I would see if

0:27:26.490,0:27:32.400
you're not you know someone may have

0:27:29.730,0:27:36.090
sent you a photo of something I don't

0:27:32.400,0:27:37.950
know years ago but you know I've heard

0:27:36.090,0:27:39.990
stories that that's what people do now

0:27:37.950,0:27:41.310
but I don't know I don't know I don't

0:27:39.990,0:27:42.330
know that I'd find a lot of that I think

0:27:41.310,0:27:45.420
if you did ever get anything like that

0:27:42.330,0:27:51.390
I'd be the first one you'd show you'd be

0:27:45.420,0:27:52.700
like what this fool sent me I don't know

0:27:51.390,0:27:54.900
that there's anything crazy on there

0:27:52.700,0:27:57.480
unless there's discussions you've had

0:27:54.900,0:28:03.930
with your people about me what's your

0:27:57.480,0:28:07.620
lining what I don't know BuzzFeed lists

0:28:03.930,0:28:11.850
yeah boring stuff yeah married girl

0:28:07.620,0:28:13.080
stuff yeah yeah was that me that was

0:28:11.850,0:28:16.590
that was you that asked from you know

0:28:13.080,0:28:31.710
that oh what's the one thing you can't

0:28:16.590,0:28:35.250
stand about me pick only one and that's

0:28:31.710,0:28:35.880
a really strong phrase I think I think

0:28:35.250,0:28:41.790
that's the point

0:28:35.880,0:28:44.550
hmm everything you've ever done I've

0:28:41.790,0:28:46.890
told you instantly like smacking

0:28:44.550,0:28:49.320
chocolate ice cream there's no need to

0:28:46.890,0:28:52.800
smack it's pretty well I think you're

0:28:49.320,0:28:54.000
also too attuned to that and others okay

0:28:52.800,0:28:55.830
I don't pay attention to what other

0:28:54.000,0:28:57.510
people are eating on the subway or how

0:28:55.830,0:28:58.800
they sound eating it I wasn't anything

0:28:57.510,0:29:00.360
ice cream on the subway I haven't seen

0:28:58.800,0:29:02.130
yet and the comfort of our home and I

0:29:00.360,0:29:05.190
didn't realize that I was making that

0:29:02.130,0:29:06.690
kind of noise I think it bothers you but

0:29:05.190,0:29:12.270
you're the only person I've ever met who

0:29:06.690,0:29:14.400
it bothers um I know something it's hard

0:29:12.270,0:29:15.370
to say can't stand but something that is

0:29:14.400,0:29:17.560
of concern

0:29:15.370,0:29:19.270
could I I don't know I don't know what

0:29:17.560,0:29:20.530
they were although I feel like you don't

0:29:19.270,0:29:23.500
take out for yourself enough like it

0:29:20.530,0:29:25.270
work take up for myself and I think like

0:29:23.500,0:29:28.060
right now that doesn't affect me but I

0:29:25.270,0:29:31.600
think in the future it could like if you

0:29:28.060,0:29:33.940
don't insist on promotions and raises or

0:29:31.600,0:29:36.280
going out and getting another job I

0:29:33.940,0:29:38.290
think in the future because I'm gonna do

0:29:36.280,0:29:41.080
that every year every other year every

0:29:38.290,0:29:42.220
five years whatever well so see only

0:29:41.080,0:29:44.080
you're in a different level

0:29:42.220,0:29:47.230
professionally well in a different

0:29:44.080,0:29:49.210
purpose but why because nice because I

0:29:47.230,0:29:50.920
never cuz I do that every couple of

0:29:49.210,0:29:53.610
years I would say I want you to be like

0:29:50.920,0:29:56.950
me cuz I'm sometimes a little too much

0:29:53.610,0:30:00.220
go-getter ish then I think people should

0:29:56.950,0:30:01.570
it's it might also be what you do yeah

0:30:00.220,0:30:04.630
cuz you know that you can go somewhere

0:30:01.570,0:30:07.620
else and do that somewhere else yeah

0:30:04.630,0:30:10.570
fairly easily yeah where's I feel like

0:30:07.620,0:30:12.520
where I just stand on my principles and

0:30:10.570,0:30:14.500
say well then I'm out of here

0:30:12.520,0:30:16.840
you're you to have to be okay with me

0:30:14.500,0:30:19.570
being employed for a long time you're

0:30:16.840,0:30:22.060
right yeah which is I guess I guess I

0:30:19.570,0:30:23.830
would rather be employed and maybe have

0:30:22.060,0:30:25.510
to each and every now and then and not

0:30:23.830,0:30:30.570
get paid exactly what I think I should

0:30:25.510,0:30:33.550
be paid okay but it's also my fault for

0:30:30.570,0:30:35.710
working too hard or doing too good of a

0:30:33.550,0:30:38.200
job and then feeling bad that I'm not

0:30:35.710,0:30:39.940
recognized for it but that you think you

0:30:38.200,0:30:42.460
come home and feel bad about it and then

0:30:39.940,0:30:45.850
what I feel bad about it but I also feel

0:30:42.460,0:30:47.380
stupid for like you know yeah working

0:30:45.850,0:30:51.430
too hard at the place that doesn't

0:30:47.380,0:30:53.920
appreciate it but you know so can't

0:30:51.430,0:30:55.720
stand as strong but I worry I just

0:30:53.920,0:30:57.550
really want to worry about thank you

0:30:55.720,0:30:59.230
like that are you worried about me are

0:30:57.550,0:31:02.710
you worried about us in terms of our

0:30:59.230,0:31:12.160
weight about you you'll be good either

0:31:02.710,0:31:14.050
way there's more power in the

0:31:12.160,0:31:17.020
relationship you were me

0:31:14.050,0:31:23.230
power power what kind of power you tell

0:31:17.020,0:31:26.440
me I don't know I feel like you I know

0:31:23.230,0:31:28.030
what you're I think I am

0:31:26.440,0:31:31.410
I don't know that you think you have

0:31:28.030,0:31:35.290
more power I think that you think that I

0:31:31.410,0:31:37.990
delegate a lot of power to you okay I

0:31:35.290,0:31:42.340
think that you think that I sit back and

0:31:37.990,0:31:44.620
let you do most of the planning and or

0:31:42.340,0:31:48.970
you know and you think that equals power

0:31:44.620,0:31:57.190
I don't know about power I mean I think

0:31:48.970,0:32:00.340
that you know I don't know like you you

0:31:57.190,0:32:02.110
have definite ideas about things and I

0:32:00.340,0:32:06.580
don't necessarily one way or the other

0:32:02.110,0:32:09.010
so you win that one we do a lot of stuff

0:32:06.580,0:32:11.560
that you want to do and it's not that I

0:32:09.010,0:32:13.290
don't want to do it yeah it's just that

0:32:11.560,0:32:17.440
I don't have a lot of other stuff

0:32:13.290,0:32:20.680
demanding my time okay I'm free and easy

0:32:17.440,0:32:23.770
I'm breezy I'm good with it

0:32:20.680,0:32:25.540
I'm breezy I'm good I'm good with it all

0:32:23.770,0:32:28.600
of it so I think in terms of power I

0:32:25.540,0:32:32.320
think you know I think you feel that you

0:32:28.600,0:32:37.840
make a lot of decisions and then I

0:32:32.320,0:32:39.730
should make more power though you mean

0:32:37.840,0:32:41.710
well then what's your idea of it cuz I

0:32:39.730,0:32:46.060
guess I actually think we're pretty

0:32:41.710,0:32:49.930
equal cuz I think you know that the day

0:32:46.060,0:32:53.020
you decided you didn't want to go see X

0:32:49.930,0:32:56.140
movie whatever but you know I'd be like

0:32:53.020,0:33:00.280
oh absolutely which would be like you

0:32:56.140,0:33:02.980
making the final call you don't think I

0:33:00.280,0:33:05.020
do that now no but I think you know if

0:33:02.980,0:33:07.540
he did I would go oh absolutely

0:33:05.020,0:33:09.280
okay that's probably true yeah but I

0:33:07.540,0:33:11.560
also don't feel that I need to exert

0:33:09.280,0:33:14.430
that kind of power he's never there has

0:33:11.560,0:33:17.130
not been a there's not been in a

0:33:14.430,0:33:19.750
presidential veto that I feel I had to

0:33:17.130,0:33:21.490
extend on anything right you know I

0:33:19.750,0:33:23.890
think it's also pretty clear what I will

0:33:21.490,0:33:28.540
and will not do and vice versa you know

0:33:23.890,0:33:30.340
it's not like you know let's bring

0:33:28.540,0:33:34.539
so-and-so into it now

0:33:30.340,0:33:36.279
that I think we're good we're equal in

0:33:34.539,0:33:39.340
terms of that but I feel like in terms

0:33:36.279,0:33:41.110
of a lot of they're like a couple stuff

0:33:39.340,0:33:44.710
you feel like you do a lot of the heavy

0:33:41.110,0:33:45.700
lifting okay

0:33:44.710,0:33:50.669
but I guess that's a different

0:33:45.700,0:33:50.669
interpretation of power yeah is that me

0:33:51.450,0:33:58.890
if you could change one thing in our

0:33:54.100,0:33:58.890
relationship what would it be and why

0:34:14.159,0:34:20.349
that's not fun

0:34:17.050,0:34:22.109
if I wanted to change it I would cuz you

0:34:20.349,0:34:24.399
have the power

0:34:22.109,0:34:28.419
no cuz I've been in enough bad

0:34:24.399,0:34:31.750
relationships that I either just ran

0:34:28.419,0:34:34.540
when things got bad or flat things get

0:34:31.750,0:34:35.820
stay bad for too long that I promised

0:34:34.540,0:34:38.649
myself I wouldn't do that again

0:34:35.820,0:34:41.169
so there's any like changes to be made I

0:34:38.649,0:34:44.830
think I would tell you and make them

0:34:41.169,0:34:47.230
together okay

0:34:44.830,0:34:48.970
I think we have done that yeah we

0:34:47.230,0:34:49.899
haven't had any like major changes I

0:34:48.970,0:34:51.790
mean I guess the only thing I would

0:34:49.899,0:34:54.609
change is that we would both make a lot

0:34:51.790,0:34:56.349
more money and I mean work a lot less

0:34:54.609,0:35:01.330
like that's not a good thing in our

0:34:56.349,0:35:04.170
relationship it's yeah yeah it's math in

0:35:01.330,0:35:06.250
our power to do babe who'd be nice I

0:35:04.170,0:35:09.609
mean I can't think of anything clay yeah

0:35:06.250,0:35:14.050
I would want to change either but you

0:35:09.609,0:35:15.400
know we're still just start now yeah

0:35:14.050,0:35:19.270
okay

0:35:15.400,0:35:25.109
oh oh no I don't want to ask this if I'm

0:35:19.270,0:35:27.790
going to okay do you want to marry me

0:35:25.109,0:35:30.460
this is all been a trick it's all of it

0:35:27.790,0:35:33.050
your mom's gonna be jumping

0:35:30.460,0:35:45.320
where's they're eating they're gonna

0:35:33.050,0:35:49.610
play that Bruno Mars song do I want do I

0:35:45.320,0:35:51.320
want um it's a thought I know you know

0:35:49.610,0:35:53.770
we've had a discussion is that some it's

0:35:51.320,0:35:56.360
not something I need like there's no

0:35:53.770,0:35:58.430
religious reason to do it there's it's

0:35:56.360,0:36:00.260
not for the children it's not her you

0:35:58.430,0:36:01.670
know my mother doesn't give a shit no

0:36:00.260,0:36:06.890
one's gonna pressure me into marrying

0:36:01.670,0:36:08.900
you I don't have significant debt that

0:36:06.890,0:36:11.210
would tie you up so I don't feel like

0:36:08.900,0:36:13.160
there's a reason not to it might be good

0:36:11.210,0:36:15.460
for our taxes or it might be bad for our

0:36:13.160,0:36:17.720
taxes but that seems like a really cold

0:36:15.460,0:36:19.730
estimation of why someone would use

0:36:17.720,0:36:21.620
illegal agree with that you know we

0:36:19.730,0:36:24.980
can't protect you understood understood

0:36:21.620,0:36:26.360
and there's not that you know we can't

0:36:24.980,0:36:28.370
even really do the Brad Pitt and

0:36:26.360,0:36:30.020
Angelina Jolie until all can be married

0:36:28.370,0:36:32.240
we will stay you know that kind of

0:36:30.020,0:36:35.120
bullshit because everyone's pretty much

0:36:32.240,0:36:36.580
doing it now but for the most part in my

0:36:35.120,0:36:42.890
home state Wow

0:36:36.580,0:36:45.080
backwards ex that they are do I want to

0:36:42.890,0:36:48.890
I'm pretty sure that was question do you

0:36:45.080,0:36:50.330
want to marry me um yeah I wouldn't I

0:36:48.890,0:36:52.640
mean it's gonna sound it's such a

0:36:50.330,0:36:54.950
pretentious question and people get so

0:36:52.640,0:36:57.440
tied up in it and it's like a magic

0:36:54.950,0:37:00.260
moment but I wouldn't sure I mean I

0:36:57.440,0:37:03.380
don't have any pressure either way like

0:37:00.260,0:37:06.710
I'm not afraid of it I can totally see

0:37:03.380,0:37:08.390
it happening but I don't know what my

0:37:06.710,0:37:09.920
reasoning for it would be it is

0:37:08.390,0:37:13.010
interesting because we talked about but

0:37:09.920,0:37:15.410
I would also need to know going into it

0:37:13.010,0:37:17.450
that you would want to before you

0:37:15.410,0:37:18.560
propose yeah you spent the money on

0:37:17.450,0:37:19.880
their ring yeah

0:37:18.560,0:37:21.530
well all that aside not even the

0:37:19.880,0:37:24.200
proposal in the Rings I just wouldn't I

0:37:21.530,0:37:26.390
would need to know that it was you know

0:37:24.200,0:37:27.560
something that you and one as well we

0:37:26.390,0:37:29.900
would need to have a discussion well we

0:37:27.560,0:37:31.460
talked about this very early on like way

0:37:29.900,0:37:33.950
earlier than we probably should have but

0:37:31.460,0:37:35.810
it was like I want to make sure that you

0:37:33.950,0:37:38.570
know this is made for me and if it is a

0:37:35.810,0:37:39.920
need for you then we might not it's not

0:37:38.570,0:37:41.570
a date it's ever been Anita I'm

0:37:39.920,0:37:43.790
perfectly fine happy being

0:37:41.570,0:37:47.150
the unmarried couple you know the cool

0:37:43.790,0:37:49.120
kids yeah like I said it's never been on

0:37:47.150,0:37:51.590
my list it's never been there's no

0:37:49.120,0:37:54.110
there's no reason to do it other than to

0:37:51.590,0:37:56.330
do it and I wouldn't mind doing it if

0:37:54.110,0:37:59.420
it's something that we decided we wanted

0:37:56.330,0:38:02.120
to do or if some reasoning came up like

0:37:59.420,0:38:04.730
I think if we were gonna have kids you

0:38:02.120,0:38:07.280
know 1950s dad and me would want to say

0:38:04.730,0:38:10.850
okay I looked at married you know just

0:38:07.280,0:38:13.190
so you the kids can whatever you know we

0:38:10.850,0:38:15.920
were gonna adopt something I don't know

0:38:13.190,0:38:17.810
or if legally there was something like

0:38:15.920,0:38:21.200
we couldn't see the dog if the dog was

0:38:17.810,0:38:25.040
ill without yeah then yes but I don't

0:38:21.200,0:38:26.570
have any strong stirrings to get married

0:38:25.040,0:38:31.040
and does that have anything really to do

0:38:26.570,0:38:33.200
with you it's not anything having it's

0:38:31.040,0:38:35.690
their judgment on you or on us I feel

0:38:33.200,0:38:39.320
family I just feel like as an

0:38:35.690,0:38:40.700
institution it's never been you know but

0:38:39.320,0:38:41.570
of course my father was married like

0:38:40.700,0:38:44.840
four times

0:38:41.570,0:38:48.050
it was very dream so you know the

0:38:44.840,0:38:48.560
sanctity of it is in question it's a

0:38:48.050,0:39:03.950
joke

0:38:48.560,0:39:05.240
yeah I don't know I can't forgive any of

0:39:03.950,0:39:06.740
your okay

0:39:05.240,0:39:08.480
yeah I can't think of any of your

0:39:06.740,0:39:12.920
friends that I would sleep with I was

0:39:08.480,0:39:15.290
gonna ask that whoo it's awkward which

0:39:12.920,0:39:19.280
is whatever the question was which of my

0:39:15.290,0:39:22.450
friends would you sleep with I just

0:39:19.280,0:39:22.450
thought I couldn't think of anybody I

0:39:25.270,0:39:33.520
don't know I mean I feel like I don't

0:39:31.310,0:39:33.520
know

0:39:34.869,0:39:41.089
there's a reason for not doing all of

0:39:37.220,0:39:45.650
them like I feel like most of your

0:39:41.089,0:39:47.359
friends are gay so you know I don't

0:39:45.650,0:39:48.740
think Christina would be interested yeah

0:39:47.359,0:39:51.559
I thought you would say her

0:39:48.740,0:39:52.569
no no I don't know if I have what she

0:39:51.559,0:39:55.309
needs

0:39:52.569,0:39:59.809
after you know uh you know I've heard

0:39:55.309,0:40:02.990
stories but I don't know it just I feel

0:39:59.809,0:40:05.260
like your friends are your friends I

0:40:02.990,0:40:08.089
would let you know yeah it's weird

0:40:05.260,0:40:10.910
yeah you don't have anything you enough

0:40:08.089,0:40:12.589
I feel like we were kind of tandem and

0:40:10.910,0:40:21.319
answering them anywhere at least we were

0:40:12.589,0:40:28.539
in agreement I felt like the questions

0:40:21.319,0:40:30.980
were great but I can we're just boring

0:40:28.539,0:40:36.289
okay I made the joke that we're boring

0:40:30.980,0:40:38.900
mm-hmm I can't think of anything that I

0:40:36.289,0:40:41.960
need to know or you know oh do you want

0:40:38.900,0:40:44.359
to marry me can we do that one we can do

0:40:41.960,0:40:49.069
that one I actually thought you were

0:40:44.359,0:40:51.470
gonna do that I'm not saying that I

0:40:49.069,0:40:54.650
answer for us no I know I feel alone I

0:40:51.470,0:40:58.250
feel pretty much the same way my issues

0:40:54.650,0:41:02.270
are I do I do you want to ask that one

0:40:58.250,0:41:03.380
yeah well marry one okay so I feel the

0:41:02.270,0:41:05.630
same way mmm

0:41:03.380,0:41:08.930
but having been married for legal

0:41:05.630,0:41:12.650
reasons and not love reasons I also see

0:41:08.930,0:41:16.369
it differently right which I figure yeah

0:41:12.650,0:41:18.049
I like to have a reception I'd like to

0:41:16.369,0:41:19.700
have a party in a pink dress I figure we

0:41:18.049,0:41:21.349
can do that at some point there'll be

0:41:19.700,0:41:24.730
some milestone but I feel like that's

0:41:21.349,0:41:27.230
just the girl in mean that once all the

0:41:24.730,0:41:31.039
bride's Oeste know I don't wanna be a

0:41:27.230,0:41:33.880
bridezilla you would be I want a pink

0:41:31.039,0:41:37.250
dress yeah

0:41:33.880,0:41:39.859
what am I scared to tell you you can't

0:41:37.250,0:41:45.650
ask me well what are you scared to tell

0:41:39.859,0:41:46.440
me I'm always scared to talk about my

0:41:45.650,0:41:49.640
past

0:41:46.440,0:41:51.720
I always feel the need to qualify

0:41:49.640,0:41:53.640
everything and we've even talked about

0:41:51.720,0:41:55.680
that that you feeling you don't have to

0:41:53.640,0:41:57.900
explain it to me like the fact that I

0:41:55.680,0:42:02.280
married my gay best friend so that his

0:41:57.900,0:42:05.490
parents didn't kill em Gilles bench I

0:42:02.280,0:42:09.089
mean yeah like I feel I feel like so

0:42:05.490,0:42:10.800
many times between that and now so many

0:42:09.089,0:42:12.780
people have questioned me like they

0:42:10.800,0:42:19.319
didn't believe me like I think I'm a

0:42:12.780,0:42:21.690
woman scorned or that I you know I'm

0:42:19.319,0:42:23.490
saving face and whatever that I always

0:42:21.690,0:42:25.560
feel like I'm having to qualify it so

0:42:23.490,0:42:29.030
anytime something when it comes up I

0:42:25.560,0:42:32.010
feel maybe scared it's more of a dread

0:42:29.030,0:42:35.730
feeling but it's like ah I have to

0:42:32.010,0:42:38.910
explain myself to anyone and with you I

0:42:35.730,0:42:42.450
want I find myself not so much anymore

0:42:38.910,0:42:45.630
but like wanting to get like if details

0:42:42.450,0:42:49.170
of the wedding or the first year of

0:42:45.630,0:42:50.760
marriage ever come up I feel strange

0:42:49.170,0:42:53.880
that I've already been through that

0:42:50.760,0:42:55.920
even though between me and him it was

0:42:53.880,0:42:59.010
just so different than like what his

0:42:55.920,0:42:59.880
parents saw you know right so I was feel

0:42:59.010,0:43:01.770
scared too

0:42:59.880,0:43:03.180
I feel like you talk of we've talked

0:43:01.770,0:43:04.800
about but yeah like it comes up in

0:43:03.180,0:43:07.050
conversation and I feel like it's you

0:43:04.800,0:43:08.220
know I don't have it I don't it's not

0:43:07.050,0:43:10.430
something that weighs heavily that I

0:43:08.220,0:43:12.869
have any questions about it but you know

0:43:10.430,0:43:14.910
you're basically pretty open about what

0:43:12.869,0:43:16.650
the situation was and how it you know

0:43:14.910,0:43:21.740
and I know all the parties involved now

0:43:16.650,0:43:24.630
no it's just kind of a thing you know I

0:43:21.740,0:43:28.170
guess other than that I'm often scared

0:43:24.630,0:43:29.670
to run into people that that I've had

0:43:28.170,0:43:31.950
relationships with sexual or otherwise

0:43:29.670,0:43:34.200
why make everybody's like that yeah you

0:43:31.950,0:43:37.339
know I think it's always awkward yeah

0:43:34.200,0:43:42.900
but you fight I'm afraid you'd get mad

0:43:37.339,0:43:44.490
that's my prerogative well it mostly

0:43:42.900,0:43:48.900
depends on the other person it doesn't

0:43:44.490,0:43:51.030
depend on you but you know I don't think

0:43:48.900,0:43:53.160
that you would

0:43:51.030,0:43:55.710
I don't know bat your eyelashes and be

0:43:53.160,0:43:59.010
coquettish towards some dude that we saw

0:43:55.710,0:44:02.460
probably not 30th Avenue that you may

0:43:59.010,0:44:04.920
have dated before and you know I don't

0:44:02.460,0:44:06.630
know I probably wouldn't even realize

0:44:04.920,0:44:08.460
that's what it was until you mentioned

0:44:06.630,0:44:12.840
it later on I like oh I used to date

0:44:08.460,0:44:24.660
that guy okay yeah I only think it's

0:44:12.840,0:44:28.140
anything to be afraid of I feel like

0:44:24.660,0:44:31.620
we're really in tune which is why I like

0:44:28.140,0:44:34.650
that like us so much so I didn't really

0:44:31.620,0:44:36.690
learn anything like crazy there are

0:44:34.650,0:44:38.250
things I might I don't want you to be

0:44:36.690,0:44:42.270
hesitant to ever tell me anything

0:44:38.250,0:44:47.160
because I'm a Balbus so I do feel like I

0:44:42.270,0:44:49.230
might your words not my words I know no

0:44:47.160,0:44:52.260
I know I know yeah um but you know

0:44:49.230,0:44:53.610
that's how you are I do I don't know I

0:44:52.260,0:44:55.530
work on it maybe I should work out a

0:44:53.610,0:44:56.280
little more so it did kind of make me no

0:44:55.530,0:44:59.520
it's fine

0:44:56.280,0:45:05.130
you know however you are is how I only

0:44:59.520,0:45:07.890
think sometimes - hmm I would be you

0:45:05.130,0:45:11.100
know I don't know what about you learned

0:45:07.890,0:45:13.710
anything I feel like we're we're on the

0:45:11.100,0:45:16.830
same page for a lot of stuff and I think

0:45:13.710,0:45:18.750
that that's good and I don't I can't

0:45:16.830,0:45:20.010
think of anything that you know I don't

0:45:18.750,0:45:24.450
know why you wouldn't sleep with my

0:45:20.010,0:45:26.160
friends they're all nice people but no

0:45:24.450,0:45:28.620

0:45:26.160,0:45:30.870
question I don't want to know I just you

0:45:28.620,0:45:37.410
know should they ever see this it'll be

0:45:30.870,0:45:40.110
a conversation that I have to have a

0:45:37.410,0:45:44.250
place I'm worried that Chris Donna's

0:45:40.110,0:45:46.530
gonna see this now - now that I said I

0:45:44.250,0:45:47.880
wouldn't sleep with her but you don't

0:45:46.530,0:45:52.830
you wouldn't because you don't think you

0:45:47.880,0:45:56.010
have what she maybe well well you know I

0:45:52.830,0:46:00.510
