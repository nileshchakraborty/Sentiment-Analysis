1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:19,460
3045 already we turn them up yeah all

2
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:22,470
right I'm ready okay question of the one

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:29,849
what do you remember about the first

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:31,769
time we met I remember that I was gonna

5
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,290
be the cool one because it just seemed

6
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:40,890
more natural and then I spilled a drink

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:42,690
really all right yeah I was super

8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,730
garrison I did wasn't expecting to be

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,110
all right that's what I remember

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,789
I can't believe that that came to my

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,950
mind first that's not the first thing I

12
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,500
remember it I would not have probably

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,199
thought of that I don't know what my

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,030
answer would have I don't know I would

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,489
have been awkward it was all awkward it

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,379
was very awkward the first time you kept

17
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,520
saying that I keep saying that well

18
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,840
that's just it you kept saying it was

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,850
gonna be awkward that I'm doing this for

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,130
the drink so it was like a way oh yeah

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:14,250
Wow you know I'm mr. smooth I'm gonna do

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:17,400
Oh Oh your mind I guess it's your turn

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,549
ah what do you love about our

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,549
relationship

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:28,530
the I don't know so far it's just been

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,140
the ease of it more than anything

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,290
because it seems like other people I've

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,210
been with and other people you date over

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,070
the course of your life it's just kind

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,380
of like so much goddamn work yeah like

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,350
you know and you don't feel like you can

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,520
be yourself and you don't feel like you

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,590
know you kind of feel like you have to

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,680
play a game a little bit and I don't

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,030
feel like I'm necessarily playing games

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,430
unless I'm playing games but then it's

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,900
kind of been put out there like we're

38
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:07,620
just fucking around right now yeah

39
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:11,340
oh when do you feel closest to me

40
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:21,090
they're closest to me when do we feel

41
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:24,690
close when do you feel closest this is

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,000
really weird too but I feel like when I

43
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,880
do something like work out and tell you

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,560
about it or have a hard day and tell you

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,210
about it cuz there's no one else in my

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,470
life like I talked about my mom and

47
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,070
mm-hmm

48
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,470
I talk about my family I talk about okay

49
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,760
trips and all that with my friends but

50
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,650
you're the only one I talk about like my

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,970
name I had a hard workout so stupid no

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,560
but do you feel close to me when you

53
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,970
tell me about it do you feel close to me

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,190
when we're going through it

55
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,840
no and I'm telling you about it like I

56
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,940
find myself wanting to call you and tell

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,900
you about it and then I afterward I

58
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,610
think okay that was I think that's when

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,700
I started knowing that it was like oh

60
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,110
this might be when you could complain to

61
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,880
me about your day okay

62
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,260
no I agreed agreed no it's good I mean

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,459
no they've been right now I feel really

64
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,489
close to you right yeah we have the

65
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,989
table looks fine it's like a jailhouse I

66
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,880
feel like I've done something well we

67
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,340
should have like a should be on the

68
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,330
phone yeah oh I'm sorry I think right

69
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,920
yeah hmm ooh you ready for this

70
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:34,350
I guess what are you hesitant to tell me

71
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:39,420
what am i hesitant to tell you right now

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:44,400
or ever ever I'm gonna go ahead and make

73
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:49,140
that call hmm I don't know it's always

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:53,700
difficult to tell you difficult if not

75
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,989
impossible to tell you if something that

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,030
you've done has bothered me like what

77
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,100
that might be me it might not be you

78
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,650
everything might be my perception of you

79
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,950
I can't think of one right off the top

80
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,810
of my dresser a little bit a little bit

81
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,560
let's be honest this is all about

82
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,510
honesty I think that sometimes you'll do

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,079
something and I'll be like

84
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,600
oh I don't agree with that but it's not

85
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,210
worth it for me to have that

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,770
conversation because it's usually not

87
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,479
anything big it's usually not anything

88
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,550
that I need to have a conversation about

89
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,889
it's like usually slept like shouldn't

90
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:34,850
just let that go kid is it my only child

91
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:37,460
maybe maybe I don't want to analyze you

92
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,960
but yeah but and then it could just be

93
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,970
me it could be my perception of whatever

94
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
it is and maybe I'm the wrong one and

95
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,430
then I don't want to have that

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,810
conversation either you know because

97
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:51,590
maybe I'm overreacting okay that's it

98
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,479
make sense huh okay good we're not

99
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,229
giving him surprises out here this is a

100
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:59,930
oh and leading into that tell me about

101
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:02,780
the time I disappointed you and how do

102
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,260
you feel about it now as if there were

103
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,600
just one time I don't actually I have to

104
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,750
be really on it mm-hmm this is a little

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,870
deep preaching like we're the only ones

106
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,449
here okay I think I've been disappointed

107
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,210
by so many people in my life but the

108
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:22,669
fact that you have so rarely like is

109
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,830
huge it makes me feel even more trusting

110
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,570
of you so I know that's not the answer

111
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,289
to the question but I'm gonna lead with

112
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,210
that having said that I think the

113
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,070
disappointment that I've ever felt with

114
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,370
you I've ever I think I've expressed

115
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:40,190
like and it's always really stupid stuff

116
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,960
right well I can't agree to that right

117
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,840
sure at the moment it's the most simple

118
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,789
well no like I've had a really long day

119
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,330
of making decisions which we obviously

120
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:52,400
talked about and I just want you to pick

121
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,860
where you go to dinner and the answer is

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,750
no I know that's so stupid but that's

123
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:01,460
the biggest disappointment you've caused

124
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,680
okay don't feel very disappointed with

125
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,870
you in general I'll take it we're not

126
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,190
very far I mean nine months then I guess

127
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:12,289
you have a little you have time but time

128
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,500
I can make so many more mistakes thank

129
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:17,380
you thank you yeah okay I'll pick where

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,830
we're gonna

131
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:25,060
I know it is but it is it was ooh

132
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:28,540
do we have enough sex enough sex is

133
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,000
there ever an upset um I don't feel like

134
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,460
I'm missing out I don't know but I don't

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,780
feel like I'm missing out on anything

136
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,390
there there aren't necessarily times

137
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,660
where I'm like damn it if only we had

138
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:43,630
had sex I think that you know and taking

139
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,360
the long view there's gonna be plenty of

140
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,580
opportunity for me to screw up and for

141
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,740
us to have sex for me to screw up - Wow

142
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,740
and for you to have sex and for me to

143
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,070
say no to sex I've never done you're

144
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,550
allowed to though you're allowed to do

145
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,920
that

146
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,150
it sounds some patriarchal thing where

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,360
it's like it could be better romance now

148
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,190
what could be sometimes I know that's a

149
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,090
bit let's see that's a mixed message I

150
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:15,550
know I don't know sometimes you you know

151
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,200
I'm expected to take the lead ie picking

152
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,950
where we eat for dinner but sometimes

153
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,720
you might not want to have chicken and I

154
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:27,310
thanks their dinner both there were two

155
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,410
tandem questions but yeah I think I'm

156
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,030
fine with the amount of sex that I have

157
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,870
I mean there could be more there could

158
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,870
be less I I'm not dissatisfied in any

159
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,570
regard okay yeah okay

160
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,050
it's all very good on that note that

161
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,990
abundantly clear all is well enough Oh

162
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,670
am I the best sex you've ever had I have

163
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,170
to be honest and say yes well we talked

164
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:55,150
about it before yeah no agree yes yeah

165
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,910
thanks listen I don't even feel like I

166
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,240
have to speak further about it because

167
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,430
there's like no comparison I do think

168
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,690
it's the connection which this is gonna

169
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,630
look away two years ago

170
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,530
I know forever somewhere joy two years

171
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,210
ago would have been like all the

172
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,430
connection has nothing to do with this

173
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:16,270
but I think you've proven that wrong

174
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:19,120
yeah yeah well it's not just me you are

175
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:23,140
a part of it I know yeah a large part

176
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,950
some would say more than 13% well some

177
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,560
nights it no

178
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:33,200
just kidding sure we thought you could

179
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:35,750
we keep going I was just you know 6040

180
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,539
you have to be honest for this okay

181
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,890
where do you think I may fail you I know

182
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,570
it's a hard one to deal with because

183
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:48,020
I've never thought about that I've only

184
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,880
thought of where I would screw up my

185
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,230
anxiety is more from like where I would

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:59,420
screw up rather than where you would

187
00:08:51,230 --> 00:09:01,400
screw up I don't know a guy okay I'm

188
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,030
gonna have an add to it so I don't know

189
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:11,840
are we allowed to add cheese yeah well

190
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:13,990
take you go ahead like without comparing

191
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,400
me like specifically like in the past

192
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,090
what didn't work that maybe you're

193
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,460
worried might not work again it just

194
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,470
goes back to me I bet I think at some

195
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,060
point you're gonna you know maybe you're

196
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:32,350
gonna get sick having me around all the

197
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:35,840
time I don't know so I cannot fail um

198
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,520
you know you could be mean to people you

199
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,230
know you could be not welcoming to

200
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,260
friends and whatever but so far you've

201
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,250
been good okay I don't I can't think of

202
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,160
I mean

203
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:50,060
fail is such a deep like you have failed

204
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,440
me is so I mean disappointed but I can't

205
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,190
even think of a time where you've

206
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,190
disappointed me necessarily but fail you

207
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,290
you know I feel like if I had some

208
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,240
illness you would stick around I feel

209
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:06,200
like if there was some catastrophe or

210
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,860
some you know economic upheaval that you

211
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,510
would be okay or at least we'd find a

212
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,050
way I feel like we just find a way to

213
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,460
work things out okay yeah where things

214
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,410
would just work out because I feel like

215
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,380
so far in the nine months or however

216
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,540
long it's been it's like things have

217
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,710
pretty much fallen into place I feel

218
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,960
like I haven't really again it goes back

219
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:31,250
to not having to work all that hard yeah

220
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,710
I feel like powerful forces have come to

221
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:39,300
my aid you know so yeah

222
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:49,920
as weird as that sounds how do I take

223
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:52,940
you for granted I actually don't think

224
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,370
you do you do a really good job of not

225
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:02,640
taking me for granted

226
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:04,260
okay I think I don't know dumb but again

227
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,930
it could be that it hasn't I don't know

228
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,010
I don't feel taken for granted ever well

229
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,470
what if like you know like what about

230
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,300
not responding to your friends emails is

231
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,450
that me take you for granted is that

232
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,500
taking in a relationship for granted I

233
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,580
think that believe me I'm not fishing

234
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,770
for things I think that's taking their

235
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,070
comfort and like like their comfort with

236
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,750
you and they're your likability to them

237
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,190
for grant I don't think it has to do

238
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,800
with me I think that's part of I think

239
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,590
that's been my problem if you if they

240
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:40,740
took the time to reach out to you and

241
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:42,480
invite you to third party I've always

242
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,160
been under the assumption that they just

243
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,930
assumed that if you were going that I

244
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,270
was going to go to right and but they

245
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,360
didn't say joy plus wine which they have

246
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:53,420
right but now they know I get it I'm

247
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,070
saying that it might be an example yeah

248
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,690
me for maybe taking them for you know

249
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,460
maybe I did taking me for granted or

250
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,790
taking us for granted there's such a

251
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:06,510
thing as taking yeah you take it for

252
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:12,030
granted that I'm whither thou goest

253
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:15,150
cause die you have to remember they knew

254
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,060
me first thing go way longer right and

255
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,880
you were miserable horribly miserably

256
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:29,250
that's the story I've saved your life

257
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:31,260
I'm apparently sliced bread I know are

258
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,840
you okay with me sleeping with other

259
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,170
people no I mean other you've slept with

260
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,510
other people before me but and I'm you

261
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,020
know God knows we've both been around

262
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,990
the bend but not now well we had this

263
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,480
conversation that it wasn't what

264
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,210
I don't necessarily believe that we

265
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,620
agreed with the monogamy thing yeah I

266
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,240
have to say I mean that I think that's

267
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,460
the way you have to do it I mean I don't

268
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,610
want to sound judgmental but you know

269
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,340
like I feel like if you're more that you

270
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,950
do it with me someone's having a problem

271
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,410
I think if there's a three thing going

272
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,880
on it's there's always one person who's

273
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,500
getting these three in the bed

274
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,850
whatever yeah not three together but I'm

275
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,520
saying anytime you bring somebody else

276
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,620
in to like a couple I think it's

277
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,390
somebody out of those three people is

278
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,450
getting not what they're not being

279
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:26,940
served it I just feel like if I'm one of

280
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,670
the three it's not gonna work I can't

281
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,160
say that for other people I feel like I

282
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,210
can I feel like I can say that if there

283
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,410
are three people that are in a

284
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,330
relationship and even though they've

285
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,460
discussed it yeah and said this is what

286
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,160
we're gonna do and we can make this work

287
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,540
I think some of the one that one person

288
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,270
of that three isn't being honest with

289
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,180
the other two or somebody's disappointed

290
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,950
so this is a conversation I'm gonna add

291
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,860
to this chair so what if something like

292
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,920
happens like like we were talking about

293
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,920
last night if you've been to the Amazon

294
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:08,040
it's a true thing I just read a book but

295
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,570
it was a David Beckham had to get like

296
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,330
extra insurance cuz he was going to the

297
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,370
Amazon and there's microscopic fish that

298
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,170
will fly up yours yeah and oh you either

299
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,560
die or they came to me right being alike

300
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,210
to me

301
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,220
whatever it's called I don't ever want

302
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,450
to hear those words okay that's not a

303
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,790
choice I don't want that to be a choice

304
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:30,210
I all I said was I'm afraid to go to the

305
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,550
Amazon for that reason but you're saying

306
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,310
if that were to happen and you were to

307
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,560
find some solace sexually elsewhere I

308
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,740
don't know that's a weird situation and

309
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,840
I can't imagine that I would but cuz

310
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,500
it's not like you know I could do it I

311
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,420
mean you know it's just a weird creepy

312
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,790
thing yeah okay well I don't want to so

313
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,800
I think we're good but all right well we

314
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:57,030
could talk about it just know that I

315
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,140
don't think that you know I also wonder

316
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,209
like if somebody gets into a situation

317
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,939
with like so

318
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:04,220
he was married that's like have you

319
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:06,860
never seen a television show or read a

320
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,939
book or seen a movie it never it never

321
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,149
works out the Shonda Rhimes Oh what

322
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:16,249
would you do if I cheated on you

323
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:23,059
assuming it's already been done what

324
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:27,499
would I do I think that's all for me for

325
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:30,920
me okay go ahead for me I think it

326
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:32,089
depends on is it an emotional thing is

327
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,629
it just a physical

328
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:39,259
I know I know roll your eyes I I really

329
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:41,420
do like if you're absolutely madly in

330
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:44,149
love with somebody that you have to have

331
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:47,389
sex with them and but you don't want to

332
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:49,490
lose me I think that's unfair and I

333
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:52,490
would end it I think if you went on a

334
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:55,910
business trip and had too much to drink

335
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,839
and screwed up I'd be pissed right I

336
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:04,999
wouldn't want you going on a business

337
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:08,240
trip with said woman or man again but I

338
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:13,220
don't know I don't I I guess I don't put

339
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:17,059
that much stock in the physical cheating

340
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,790
so if that's what it means then okay but

341
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:23,269
don't do it let's not try it I wouldn't

342
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:26,929
know I don't believe okay I'm okay with

343
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:31,029
not doing it I you know point taken what

344
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:35,899
is missing from our relationship missing

345
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:37,970
I feel like we've only just gotten

346
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:41,299
gotten started I think we're still in

347
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:45,670
there like not the honeymoon phase

348
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:47,990
because it's silly but like I think I

349
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,720
know it's easy to say I don't feel like

350
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,790
I'm missing anything but I guess the

351
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,790
only thing we're missing as a couple or

352
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,709
in a relationship is further experiences

353
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,230
that makes sense like you know you

354
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,360
haven't live

355
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,960
together that would be something you

356
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,510
know we haven't gone through like a

357
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,560
death there's something together thank

358
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:12,300
God you know I just feel like there's if

359
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,790
anything's nothing's missing right now

360
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,410
day to day I don't feel like I don't

361
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:20,340
feel like we don't have any trust or any

362
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,320
of that stuff I feel like I can't I

363
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,680
don't know because we haven't had the

364
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:30,000
whole breadth of experience yet okay I

365
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:33,360
think I agree now that I need any of

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,170
those experiences what do you think is

367
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,090
the next step in our relationship

368
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:42,030
going to Mexico next week well I know

369
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:47,280
you're obsessed with knowing it's gonna

370
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:48,690
happen Wow yeah I what's the next step

371
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
in our relationship I think the next

372
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,100
step is not tomorrow but I think the

373
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,170
next step is do we want to move in

374
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,200
together and we've already talked about

375
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,680
it and mm-hmm when is the right time and

376
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,480
where is the right place and logistics

377
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,840
work I think that's the next time okay

378
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,140
it probably is yeah I don't really have

379
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,370
a list right that's okay you always have

380
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,350
a list but I think that might be the

381
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,860
next thing on the list you asked that

382
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,590
one right yeah yeah what are you scared

383
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,610
to tell me not hesitant that was earlier

384
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:27,380
are you scared to tell me I don't feel

385
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,380
like I have any deep dark secrets I

386
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,370
can't think of anything that I would

387
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,080
would be afraid to tell you

388
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,330
I mean well there I'm sure that you know

389
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,920
there would be hard conversations like

390
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:43,760
I'd hate to have to come home and say

391
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,690
you know I lost my job or you know I'm I

392
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,880
don't know I hope that wouldn't be

393
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,800
because of me I'm not saying because of

394
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,590
you but I'd still be afraid to tell you

395
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,270
because it's just you know I don't need

396
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,370
that in my life like any kind of

397
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:05,490
catastrophe I would feel bad I'm telling

398
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:08,550
you in terms of fears I think my it's

399
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,670
gonna be horrible just gonna tell you

400
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:13,530
a fear that I have had which is gonna be

401
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,510
horrible for you but probably silly for

402
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,850
people watching this is that at some

403
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:21,390
point you're not going to be there and I

404
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:25,140
will be there and your gun will die my

405
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,790
job yes and I will have to tell you that

406
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,860
she died because you will think that I

407
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,740
did do you think I'm gonna be at work I

408
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,970
feel like sometimes I'm gonna be there

409
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,550
when it happens

410
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:39,720
and I'm gonna have to be the one to tell

411
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:41,580
you that's interesting oh because I have

412
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,900
such clear visions of what's gonna

413
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,290
happen when she died - we sound really

414
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,540
morbid

415
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,330
but really do you know it's supposed to

416
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,250
be yeah it is she's an old dog I'm just

417
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,320
saying it could happen I know and I

418
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,940
desperately don't want it to happen when

419
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,900
I'm there and you're not I wouldn't

420
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,690
think you did it

421
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,290
I would feel a good thing somehow you

422
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:08,160
wouldn't say it but somehow you would

423
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:10,740
say did you feed her today did she need

424
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,880
something somehow I'm we're talking

425
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,830
about beers we're talking about beers

426
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,280
and this is the only one that I actively

427
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,510
had okay you know not every time but

428
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,030
like sometimes you go to get like a

429
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,910
pedicure or something and I'm there and

430
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,830
I check in with her make sure she's okay

431
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,120
sometimes in the morning before I leave

432
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,300
through work I like to make sure that

433
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,310
her chest is rising and falling okay

434
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:38,220
partly because I've I gotta get to work

435
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:41,580
I don't have time to do that I'm just

436
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:45,420
being honest was that yours or mine that

437
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:51,570
was I asked you okay but wishing that

438
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:52,890
again you will be irrational about it

439
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,500
you don't think you are now cuz you've

440
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,000
got this no I have a plan I know how

441
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,050
it's gonna or not everything is gonna

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,250
work out according to plan I think is my

443
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:07,340
fear in the back of your mind

444
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:14,610
are you scared that I'll walk away

445
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:17,250
always why the why I know it's why do

446
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,610
you think I would do that um everybody

447
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,610
does

448
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,619
Wow

449
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:35,659
how much time do you have right um no I

450
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:37,309
mean I think there are three people in

451
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:41,239
my life that I know or not I can ever

452
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:44,629
walk away and it took them years to get

453
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:48,199
there it took them years to earn that or

454
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:49,690
it took you years to realize it I think

455
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:52,669
it goes hand in hand

456
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:56,419
Noby and so I think as short as we are

457
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,759
into it I you haven't quite like died

458
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,319
out you haven't proven yet nothing

459
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,139
there's nothing to prove nothing you're

460
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:06,289
tested but well if these other three

461
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:09,169
people have been tested and won or have

462
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:10,639
been not found to be lacking mm-hmm I'm

463
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:14,329
wondering if they knew that they were in

464
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:17,779
the process of being tested or if it was

465
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:20,329
just all internally with you and when do

466
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:21,769
you know and was it something that they

467
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:24,169
did that they were aware that they did

468
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:27,049
to get there did you say okay well they

469
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:30,049
did it I'm just wondering how long I

470
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:33,019
have to work welp Jane okay yeah she did

471
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:35,239
stuff when I was a teenager that made me

472
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,969
go oh she's not going anywhere

473
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:42,049
okay Celebes been there through

474
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:46,489
everything right and I understand I

475
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:52,159
don't know I think I need 25 years and

476
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:56,869
then Katie who we're just like one we're

477
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,669
like okay so with her we went through

478
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:00,139
major life changes at the same time and

479
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,049
it just sort of happened that I was like

480
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:05,269
oh she she's never gonna go away

481
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:07,940
okay okay I'm glad for but but as I'm

482
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:09,679
saying is no length of association yeah

483
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,249
I guess it's like having been through

484
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:17,209
life experiences that they didn't run

485
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:19,459
and we just haven't had this yet but at

486
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:20,869
this point right now I mean you think

487
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:22,789
that if something should come up I'm

488
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:24,769
gonna kind of bait and go

489
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,769
I feel more comfortable than I have with

490
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:29,059
anybody else okay but do you think it

491
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:30,829
would need something like that there

492
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,149
have to be an impetus for me to go it's

493
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:32,440
not like I'm just gonna say well I'm

494
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,260
going

495
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:40,290
for a pack of smokes that's not good

496
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:40,290
because it's a 1960s TV no for a Becca

497
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:48,610
good for you

498
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:58,030
no I think it's I think it's just I

499
00:23:48,610 --> 00:24:02,680
think it's just time I think I asked you

500
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:07,210
that yeah yeah who would struggle more

501
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:10,660
if we broke up I feel I would hate I

502
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:14,040
just feel like I would I feel like you

503
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,600
have like such a support group around

504
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,790
you that would be like it's alright he

505
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,280
was a jerk blah blah whatever happened

506
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,660
they would understand whatever I feel

507
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,530
like you would have people around you

508
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,180
okay to help you through it you would I

509
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:33,700
would have people telling me how dumb I

510
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:35,320
was oh yeah you screwed up I may be I

511
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,340
think I have my friends would say what

512
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,730
did you do okay

513
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:43,420
yeah and then I feel I would just you

514
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:46,180
know fall into myself you know yes just

515
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:50,440
grow the giant beard and you know just

516
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:52,720
be sad all the time yeah mm-hmm I mean

517
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,290
it could be you I think it seemed to me

518
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,290
it would be me

519
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:07,490
hmm which one of my friends have you

520
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:10,710

I've been with the world but we do have

525
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,960
some mutual friends like I don't think

it would be one of your best friends but

527
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,710
there are a couple of times that I'm

529
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:38,220
from all right who would you sleep with

530
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:41,040

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:07,370
I've met three guys that I would never

538
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,370
consider wrong with my friends like

539
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:15,630
maybe like no I can't even okay I guess

540
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,520
nobody I can't picture it myself so

541
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,830
don't feel bad I wouldn't want to sleep

542
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,500
with any of them there are stories I've

543
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:25,170
heard from fraternity days that I can

544
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,100
see if I were in college and we were in

545
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,260
college together

546
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,240
then I would have gone for that frat guy

547
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,570
but I don't know him I've never met him

548
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,610
I probably never will okay like I can

549
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:40,770
think about the kind of guy I would have

550
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:47,940
gone for definitely well now and not go

551
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:50,460
to that weekend this year it's curious

552
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,980
is Tikku I don't even know the names I

553
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,090
can like put the story with it but it's

554
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,080
alright it's alright

555
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,820
again like 20 years ago sir um what do

556
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,870
you think you would find if you went

557
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,870
through my phone right now

558
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:15,090
a lot of texts back and forth between

559
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:17,670
your people yeah I don't think my people

560
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,160
what do you like your texts bullshit

561
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,870
there's gonna be like a lot of that you

562
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,600
know just back and forth with other

563
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,490
folks but I don't know that there's

564
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,730
anything untoward that I would see if

565
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:32,400
you're not you know someone may have

566
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:36,090
sent you a photo of something I don't

567
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,950
know years ago but you know I've heard

568
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,990
stories that that's what people do now

569
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,310
but I don't know I don't know I don't

570
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,330
know that I'd find a lot of that I think

571
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,420
if you did ever get anything like that

572
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:51,390
I'd be the first one you'd show you'd be

573
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:52,700
like what this fool sent me I don't know

574
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,900
that there's anything crazy on there

575
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,480
unless there's discussions you've had

576
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:03,930
with your people about me what's your

577
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:07,620
lining what I don't know BuzzFeed lists

578
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:11,850
yeah boring stuff yeah married girl

579
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,080
stuff yeah yeah was that me that was

580
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,590
that was you that asked from you know

581
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:31,710
that oh what's the one thing you can't

582
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:35,250
stand about me pick only one and that's

583
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,880
a really strong phrase I think I think

584
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:41,790
that's the point

585
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:44,550
hmm everything you've ever done I've

586
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,890
told you instantly like smacking

587
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,320
chocolate ice cream there's no need to

588
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:52,800
smack it's pretty well I think you're

589
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,000
also too attuned to that and others okay

590
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,830
I don't pay attention to what other

591
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,510
people are eating on the subway or how

592
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,800
they sound eating it I wasn't anything

593
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,360
ice cream on the subway I haven't seen

594
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,130
yet and the comfort of our home and I

595
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,190
didn't realize that I was making that

596
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,690
kind of noise I think it bothers you but

597
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:12,270
you're the only person I've ever met who

598
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:14,400
it bothers um I know something it's hard

599
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,370
to say can't stand but something that is

600
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,560
of concern

601
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,270
could I I don't know I don't know what

602
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,530
they were although I feel like you don't

603
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,500
take out for yourself enough like it

604
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:25,270
work take up for myself and I think like

605
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,060
right now that doesn't affect me but I

606
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:31,600
think in the future it could like if you

607
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,940
don't insist on promotions and raises or

608
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,280
going out and getting another job I

609
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,290
think in the future because I'm gonna do

610
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,080
that every year every other year every

611
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:42,220
five years whatever well so see only

612
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,080
you're in a different level

613
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,230
professionally well in a different

614
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,210
purpose but why because nice because I

615
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,920
never cuz I do that every couple of

616
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,610
years I would say I want you to be like

617
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,950
me cuz I'm sometimes a little too much

618
00:29:53,610 --> 00:30:00,220
go-getter ish then I think people should

619
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,570
it's it might also be what you do yeah

620
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,630
cuz you know that you can go somewhere

621
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:07,620
else and do that somewhere else yeah

622
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:10,570
fairly easily yeah where's I feel like

623
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,520
where I just stand on my principles and

624
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,500
say well then I'm out of here

625
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,840
you're you to have to be okay with me

626
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,570
being employed for a long time you're

627
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,060
right yeah which is I guess I guess I

628
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,830
would rather be employed and maybe have

629
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,510
to each and every now and then and not

630
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:30,570
get paid exactly what I think I should

631
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:33,550
be paid okay but it's also my fault for

632
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,710
working too hard or doing too good of a

633
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,200
job and then feeling bad that I'm not

634
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,940
recognized for it but that you think you

635
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,460
come home and feel bad about it and then

636
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,850
what I feel bad about it but I also feel

637
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,380
stupid for like you know yeah working

638
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:51,430
too hard at the place that doesn't

639
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,920
appreciate it but you know so can't

640
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,720
stand as strong but I worry I just

641
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,550
really want to worry about thank you

642
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,230
like that are you worried about me are

643
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:02,710
you worried about us in terms of our

644
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:12,160
weight about you you'll be good either

645
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:14,050
way there's more power in the

646
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,020
relationship you were me

647
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:23,230
power power what kind of power you tell

648
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:26,440
me I don't know I feel like you I know

649
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,030
what you're I think I am

650
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,410
I don't know that you think you have

651
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:35,290
more power I think that you think that I

652
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:37,990
delegate a lot of power to you okay I

653
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:42,340
think that you think that I sit back and

654
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:44,620
let you do most of the planning and or

655
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:48,970
you know and you think that equals power

656
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:57,190
I don't know about power I mean I think

657
00:31:48,970 --> 00:32:00,340
that you know I don't know like you you

658
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,110
have definite ideas about things and I

659
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,580
don't necessarily one way or the other

660
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:09,010
so you win that one we do a lot of stuff

661
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,560
that you want to do and it's not that I

662
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,290
don't want to do it yeah it's just that

663
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:17,440
I don't have a lot of other stuff

664
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:20,680
demanding my time okay I'm free and easy

665
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,770
I'm breezy I'm good with it

666
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,540
I'm breezy I'm good I'm good with it all

667
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:28,600
of it so I think in terms of power I

668
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:32,320
think you know I think you feel that you

669
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:37,840
make a lot of decisions and then I

670
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,730
should make more power though you mean

671
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,710
well then what's your idea of it cuz I

672
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:46,060
guess I actually think we're pretty

673
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:49,930
equal cuz I think you know that the day

674
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:53,020
you decided you didn't want to go see X

675
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:56,140
movie whatever but you know I'd be like

676
00:32:53,020 --> 00:33:00,280
oh absolutely which would be like you

677
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,980
making the final call you don't think I

678
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,020
do that now no but I think you know if

679
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,540
he did I would go oh absolutely

680
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,280
okay that's probably true yeah but I

681
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,560
also don't feel that I need to exert

682
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,430
that kind of power he's never there has

683
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,130
not been a there's not been in a

684
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:19,750
presidential veto that I feel I had to

685
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,490
extend on anything right you know I

686
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,890
think it's also pretty clear what I will

687
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:28,540
and will not do and vice versa you know

688
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:30,340
it's not like you know let's bring

689
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,539
so-and-so into it now

690
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:36,279
that I think we're good we're equal in

691
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:39,340
terms of that but I feel like in terms

692
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:41,110
of a lot of they're like a couple stuff

693
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,710
you feel like you do a lot of the heavy

694
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,700
lifting okay

695
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:50,669
but I guess that's a different

696
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,669
interpretation of power yeah is that me

697
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:58,890
if you could change one thing in our

698
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,890
relationship what would it be and why

699
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,349
that's not fun

700
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,109
if I wanted to change it I would cuz you

701
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:24,399
have the power

702
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:28,419
no cuz I've been in enough bad

703
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:31,750
relationships that I either just ran

704
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:34,540
when things got bad or flat things get

705
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,820
stay bad for too long that I promised

706
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,649
myself I wouldn't do that again

707
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:41,169
so there's any like changes to be made I

708
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:44,830
think I would tell you and make them

709
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:47,230
together okay

710
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,970
I think we have done that yeah we

711
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,899
haven't had any like major changes I

712
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,790
mean I guess the only thing I would

713
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,609
change is that we would both make a lot

714
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,349
more money and I mean work a lot less

715
00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:01,330
like that's not a good thing in our

716
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:04,170
relationship it's yeah yeah it's math in

717
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,250
our power to do babe who'd be nice I

718
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,609
mean I can't think of anything clay yeah

719
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:14,050
I would want to change either but you

720
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:15,400
know we're still just start now yeah

721
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:19,270
okay

722
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:25,109
oh oh no I don't want to ask this if I'm

723
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:27,790
going to okay do you want to marry me

724
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:30,460
this is all been a trick it's all of it

725
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:33,050
your mom's gonna be jumping

726
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:45,320
where's they're eating they're gonna

727
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:49,610
play that Bruno Mars song do I want do I

728
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,320
want um it's a thought I know you know

729
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,770
we've had a discussion is that some it's

730
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,360
not something I need like there's no

731
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,430
religious reason to do it there's it's

732
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,260
not for the children it's not her you

733
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,670
know my mother doesn't give a shit no

734
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,890
one's gonna pressure me into marrying

735
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:08,900
you I don't have significant debt that

736
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:11,210
would tie you up so I don't feel like

737
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,160
there's a reason not to it might be good

738
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,460
for our taxes or it might be bad for our

739
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,720
taxes but that seems like a really cold

740
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,730
estimation of why someone would use

741
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,620
illegal agree with that you know we

742
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,980
can't protect you understood understood

743
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,360
and there's not that you know we can't

744
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,370
even really do the Brad Pitt and

745
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,020
Angelina Jolie until all can be married

746
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,240
we will stay you know that kind of

747
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:35,120
bullshit because everyone's pretty much

748
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,580
doing it now but for the most part in my

749
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:42,890
home state Wow

750
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:45,080
backwards ex that they are do I want to

751
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:48,890
I'm pretty sure that was question do you

752
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,330
want to marry me um yeah I wouldn't I

753
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,640
mean it's gonna sound it's such a

754
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:54,950
pretentious question and people get so

755
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,440
tied up in it and it's like a magic

756
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:00,260
moment but I wouldn't sure I mean I

757
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,380
don't have any pressure either way like

758
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:06,710
I'm not afraid of it I can totally see

759
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,390
it happening but I don't know what my

760
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,920
reasoning for it would be it is

761
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:13,010
interesting because we talked about but

762
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,410
I would also need to know going into it

763
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,450
that you would want to before you

764
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,560
propose yeah you spent the money on

765
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,880
their ring yeah

766
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,530
well all that aside not even the

767
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,200
proposal in the Rings I just wouldn't I

768
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,390
would need to know that it was you know

769
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,560
something that you and one as well we

770
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,900
would need to have a discussion well we

771
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,460
talked about this very early on like way

772
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,950
earlier than we probably should have but

773
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,810
it was like I want to make sure that you

774
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,570
know this is made for me and if it is a

775
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,920
need for you then we might not it's not

776
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,570
a date it's ever been Anita I'm

777
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,790
perfectly fine happy being

778
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:47,150
the unmarried couple you know the cool

779
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:49,120
kids yeah like I said it's never been on

780
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,590
my list it's never been there's no

781
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,110
there's no reason to do it other than to

782
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:56,330
do it and I wouldn't mind doing it if

783
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:59,420
it's something that we decided we wanted

784
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:02,120
to do or if some reasoning came up like

785
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,730
I think if we were gonna have kids you

786
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,280
know 1950s dad and me would want to say

787
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:10,850
okay I looked at married you know just

788
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,190
so you the kids can whatever you know we

789
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,920
were gonna adopt something I don't know

790
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,810
or if legally there was something like

791
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,200
we couldn't see the dog if the dog was

792
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:25,040
ill without yeah then yes but I don't

793
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,570
have any strong stirrings to get married

794
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,040
and does that have anything really to do

795
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:33,200
with you it's not anything having it's

796
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,690
their judgment on you or on us I feel

797
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,320
family I just feel like as an

798
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,700
institution it's never been you know but

799
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,570
of course my father was married like

800
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,840
four times

801
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:48,050
it was very dream so you know the

802
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,560
sanctity of it is in question it's a

803
00:38:48,050 --> 00:39:03,950
joke

804
00:38:48,560 --> 00:39:05,240
yeah I don't know I can't forgive any of

805
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,740
your okay

806
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,480
yeah I can't think of any of your

807
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:12,920
friends that I would sleep with I was

808
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,290
gonna ask that whoo it's awkward which

809
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,280
is whatever the question was which of my

810
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:22,450
friends would you sleep with I just

811
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,450
thought I couldn't think of anybody I

812
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:33,520
don't know I mean I feel like I don't

813
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,520
know

814
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:41,089
there's a reason for not doing all of

815
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:45,650
them like I feel like most of your

816
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:47,359
friends are gay so you know I don't

817
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,740
think Christina would be interested yeah

818
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,559
I thought you would say her

819
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,569
no no I don't know if I have what she

820
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,309
needs

821
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:59,809
after you know uh you know I've heard

822
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:02,990
stories but I don't know it just I feel

823
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:05,260
like your friends are your friends I

824
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:08,089
would let you know yeah it's weird

825
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,910
yeah you don't have anything you enough

826
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:12,589
I feel like we were kind of tandem and

827
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:21,319
answering them anywhere at least we were

828
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:28,539
in agreement I felt like the questions

829
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:30,980
were great but I can we're just boring

830
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:36,289
okay I made the joke that we're boring

831
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:38,900
mm-hmm I can't think of anything that I

832
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:41,960
need to know or you know oh do you want

833
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,359
to marry me can we do that one we can do

834
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:49,069
that one I actually thought you were

835
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:51,470
gonna do that I'm not saying that I

836
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:54,650
answer for us no I know I feel alone I

837
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:58,250
feel pretty much the same way my issues

838
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:02,270
are I do I do you want to ask that one

839
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:03,380
yeah well marry one okay so I feel the

840
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,630
same way mmm

841
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,930
but having been married for legal

842
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:12,650
reasons and not love reasons I also see

843
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:16,369
it differently right which I figure yeah

844
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:18,049
I like to have a reception I'd like to

845
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:19,700
have a party in a pink dress I figure we

846
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:21,349
can do that at some point there'll be

847
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,730
some milestone but I feel like that's

848
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:27,230
just the girl in mean that once all the

849
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:31,039
bride's Oeste know I don't wanna be a

850
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:33,880
bridezilla you would be I want a pink

851
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:37,250
dress yeah

852
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,859
what am I scared to tell you you can't

853
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:45,650
ask me well what are you scared to tell

854
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:46,440
me I'm always scared to talk about my

855
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,640
past

856
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,720
I always feel the need to qualify

857
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,640
everything and we've even talked about

858
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,680
that that you feeling you don't have to

859
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,900
explain it to me like the fact that I

860
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,280
married my gay best friend so that his

861
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:05,490
parents didn't kill em Gilles bench I

862
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,089
mean yeah like I feel I feel like so

863
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:10,800
many times between that and now so many

864
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:12,780
people have questioned me like they

865
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:19,319
didn't believe me like I think I'm a

866
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:21,690
woman scorned or that I you know I'm

867
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,490
saving face and whatever that I always

868
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,560
feel like I'm having to qualify it so

869
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,030
anytime something when it comes up I

870
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:32,010
feel maybe scared it's more of a dread

871
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:35,730
feeling but it's like ah I have to

872
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:38,910
explain myself to anyone and with you I

873
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:42,450
want I find myself not so much anymore

874
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:45,630
but like wanting to get like if details

875
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:49,170
of the wedding or the first year of

876
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,760
marriage ever come up I feel strange

877
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,880
that I've already been through that

878
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,920
even though between me and him it was

879
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,010
just so different than like what his

880
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,880
parents saw you know right so I was feel

881
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,770
scared too

882
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,180
I feel like you talk of we've talked

883
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,800
about but yeah like it comes up in

884
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,050
conversation and I feel like it's you

885
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,220
know I don't have it I don't it's not

886
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,430
something that weighs heavily that I

887
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,869
have any questions about it but you know

888
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,910
you're basically pretty open about what

889
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:16,650
the situation was and how it you know

890
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,740
and I know all the parties involved now

891
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:24,630
no it's just kind of a thing you know I

892
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:28,170
guess other than that I'm often scared

893
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,670
to run into people that that I've had

894
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,950
relationships with sexual or otherwise

895
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,200
why make everybody's like that yeah you

896
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:37,339
know I think it's always awkward yeah

897
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:42,900
but you fight I'm afraid you'd get mad

898
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:44,490
that's my prerogative well it mostly

899
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,900
depends on the other person it doesn't

900
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:51,030
depend on you but you know I don't think

901
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,160
that you would

902
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,710
I don't know bat your eyelashes and be

903
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,010
coquettish towards some dude that we saw

904
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:02,460
probably not 30th Avenue that you may

905
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:04,920
have dated before and you know I don't

906
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,630
know I probably wouldn't even realize

907
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,460
that's what it was until you mentioned

908
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:12,840
it later on I like oh I used to date

909
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:24,660
that guy okay yeah I only think it's

910
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:28,140
anything to be afraid of I feel like

911
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:31,620
we're really in tune which is why I like

912
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:34,650
that like us so much so I didn't really

913
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,690
learn anything like crazy there are

914
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,250
things I might I don't want you to be

915
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:42,270
hesitant to ever tell me anything

916
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:47,160
because I'm a Balbus so I do feel like I

917
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:49,230
might your words not my words I know no

918
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,260
I know I know yeah um but you know

919
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,610
that's how you are I do I don't know I

920
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,530
work on it maybe I should work out a

921
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,280
little more so it did kind of make me no

922
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,520
it's fine

923
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:05,130
you know however you are is how I only

924
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:07,890
think sometimes - hmm I would be you

925
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:11,100

926
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:13,710

927
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,830
same page for a lot of stuff and I think

928
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,750
that that's good and I don't I can't

929
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,010
think of anything that you know I don't

930
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,450
know why you wouldn't sleep with my

931
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:26,160

935
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:40,110
a conversation that I have to have a

936
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:44,250
place I'm worried that Chris Donna's

937
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:46,530
gonna see this now - now that I said I

938
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,880

939
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:52,830
you wouldn't because you don't think you

940
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:56,010
have what she maybe well well you know I

941
00:45:52,830 --> 00:46:00,510

943
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:06,680
