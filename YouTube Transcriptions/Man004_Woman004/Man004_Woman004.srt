1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,609
now you just lost because it was also

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,609
whoever laughs first

3
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:31,920
I'll be at 30 yeah oh okay oh so you're

4
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:34,869
gonna like give us a cue or something oh

5
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,780
okay well you gotta go first I had no

6
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:39,819
problem with the staring but being quiet

7
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:48,159
for 30 seconds is an accomplishment

8
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:59,049
I just what's your favorite childhood

9
00:01:48,159 --> 00:02:02,110
memory and why probably to like more

10
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:04,689
generally speaking just being together

11
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,119
as a family and like family road trips

12
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,789
thank you and mom really instilled bad

13
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,810
and us that you should be adventurous

14
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:19,450
and like piling into mom's minivan and

15
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:22,349
driving to Florida and going out to

16
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:26,350
California when Laura came in and just

17
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,180
like feeling really safe and free

18
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,100
I feel like generally like any time with

19
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,200
family it's just like a good memory for

20
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,109
me because it was important to you guys

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,690
and like it shaped me but I would say my

22
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:40,000
first memory that is that I can like

23
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,609
remember having as a little kid

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,540
and I'm only saying this because it

25
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:50,350
involves you is I remember being really

26
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,180
sick one night like super sick and

27
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,260
having a fever I don't know how old I

28
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,980
was but you like took me out of bed and

29
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:03,130
held me in your room like buying a big

30
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,230
dresser that you have and like just kept

31
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,750
rocking me back and forth and like

32
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,940
petting my head and I like I remember

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,829
that like I remember feeling really safe

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:18,250
it's my first memory and like probably

35
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:20,169
my it's like safe place memory well that

36
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,870
that's that's a good memory to have I'm

37
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:25,510
not sure I wouldn't think you could go

38
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,680
back quite that far but and I'm not sure

39
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,810
how far it is but that process that you

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,140
described happens from

41
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,239
when you were not necessarily you didn't

42
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,470
have to be sick for me to hold you close

43
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,959
that way yeah and I just just love you

44
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,370
but I remember like being really sick

45
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,160
and you're doing it I'm sure it happened

46
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,050
more times than that oh that's that's a

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,410
that's a certainly a pleasant memory for

48
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:56,380
me

49
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:58,390
I miss it hard to hold me now all right

50
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:02,610
right away if we get to the next

51
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:07,690
question all of the adventures were

52
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,069
we're not that easy for both of us she

53
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,959
doesn't talk about it but there were

54
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:16,780
occasions we went astray a little bit

55
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:21,030
and nothing serious the family

56
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,030
adventures who are fun indeed I'm sorry

57
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,830
when you when you think of the first

58
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,510
time we met what do you remember I guess

59
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:34,300
when you think of when I was born what's

60
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:36,940
here fuck yeah yes I still see you as an

61
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:43,930
infant as soon as you were born I was

62
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:48,220
there as as you know I have seven

63
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,990
children but before you my oldest four I

64
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,360
never saw being born

65
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,300
it just wasn't permitted then and

66
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,060
starting with Nick and then you and

67
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,710
Julie I did was in the room where the

68
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:07,120
birth took place so clearly that blessed

69
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:09,340
that first time I met you and some

70
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,889
babies but you know newborn babies it's

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,330
not their finest moment but you were

72
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:18,030
beautiful from the day that you were

73
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,530
born and I still could see your face

74
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,539
I've forgotten a lot of other things but

75
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:27,580
I still seated your face the day that

76
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:30,880
you were born it was it was a wonderful

77
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,720
occasion every child's birth is a

78
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,720
wonderful occasion

79
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,990
you were youth wishing your mom's first

80
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,550
child and that was special to her and

81
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,069
certainly was special to me

82
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:49,210
and hasn't changed you are still and

83
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:50,500
always will be special okay I don't have

84
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,740
anything to say about the first time we

85
00:05:50,500 --> 00:06:08,289
went no mic yeah we just go back and

86
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:09,849
forth okay is sort of like the other one

87
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:16,360
but it's what's the most fun you've had

88
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:21,669
with me and why we went to Cedar Point

89
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:24,400
in Ohio with John Andrew and because you

90
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,050
were like a little kid I mean you were

91
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,280
like running around here on every roller

92
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:34,210
coaster you were like you were just

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,819
really happy and like just such a free

94
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:43,860
spirit and it was just a fun trip but

95
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:46,930
that's like that's my probably I

96
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:51,360
certainly remember that likewise it was

97
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,710
a fun experience besides you and Julie

98
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,520
your brother Nick was there your brother

99
00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:04,300
John was there and then several of your

100
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:08,169
nieces and nephews and I just read you

101
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,380
say I was energetic and participating in

102
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:15,190
everything but what I also remember from

103
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:18,250
that trip I'm not sure I could do it

104
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:26,469
anymore but in those days I was able to

105
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:28,539
trick the like 50-something well like 20

106
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,849
years off or something like that oh they

107
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:34,210
were 20 years old yeah I remember

108
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,889
yeah whatever age I actually was we

109
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,280
could sort of figure it out it's

110
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:45,849
probably about maybe 15 years ago

111
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:48,340
no no quick 10 well anyway anyway they I

112
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:50,919
remember what age they guessed that

113
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,229
guessed 48 which may not seem like

114
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,840
that's doing anybody any favors but I

115
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,120
was told

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,780
years beyond that 58 so yeah that's

117
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:05,120
about what it was yeah so it was a fun

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:08,750
fun time yes I remember it well is your

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,880
turn all right I'm gonna just never know

120
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:15,949
if you're getting this but please edit

121
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:19,330
that out okay okay what do you think is

122
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,330
special about our relationship

123
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:38,329
I think the one word that would describe

124
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:40,219
but the most is respect we have plenty

125
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:42,800
of differences differences in just

126
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,440
opinions not that many of those and

127
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,750
sometimes differences or you know other

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,360
things certainly doing the planning of

129
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,269
your wedding we've had a few but mostly

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,389
I have like whatever you want to do you

131
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:58,670
know it stands almost exclusive had I've

132
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:04,819
done that and you're gonna have a

133
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:09,380
wonderful wedding but I of course I

134
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:14,779
respect you but I I believe in you okay

135
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:20,120
and with your six siblings blessed would

136
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:21,709
every one of them and said for them if

137
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,839
not all of them in their own way have

138
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:29,199
excelled you from the day that you

139
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,269
started interacting with other people

140
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:34,399
on children and adults which would have

141
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,980
been it wasn't the first time if that

142
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,490
happened but when you were at the child

143
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,860
care center the one that was associated

144
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,060
with the church and she spent a lot of

145
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:51,889
time in there's a very well-run center

146
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:56,120
but from that time till as recently as

147
00:09:51,889 --> 00:10:01,660
when Anna when you visited with with

148
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:08,350
Anna and she her you know sent back

149
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:11,449
accolades commendations anytime anyone

150
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:14,660
interacts with you even for just a

151
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:16,670
little teeny bit they always come away

152
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,019
not just with her she's nice or

153
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,500
something like that but they come away

154
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:26,079
if it gets back to familiar to your mom

155
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:29,810
and oftentimes it does with superlatives

156
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,720
so you have always engendered that kind

157
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,769
of reaction in people it's something I

158
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,520
admire about you you have always

159
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:42,110
excelled

160
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:46,670
going back to the days mrs. niches class

161
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:50,920
where you were doing the presentations

162
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:55,490
and we would go over them together but

163
00:10:50,920 --> 00:11:01,430
you never had a second problem in any of

164
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:03,920
your schoolwork or academics and through

165
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,870
college if there was any problem and

166
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,910
perhaps still now it's that you are so

167
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:15,460
concerned with perfection that sometimes

168
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,280
oftentimes it becomes stressful for you

169
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:22,580
but you have done nothing for your 30

170
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,770
years but distinguish yourself and I

171
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,650
have no doubt that whatever you do

172
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:32,570
whatever you attempt to do your getting

173
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:35,350
involved in the business now I have no

174
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:42,980
doubt that you will be successful and

175
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:48,260
always be as poised and personable and

176
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:51,260
nice as you are now do that in its

177
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,690
entirety like you're giving wedding

178
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,090
speeches okay talking to me nothing I

179
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,750
know I know they could always get it in

180
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,310
there I agree about but the respects all

181
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,370
right I feel like you think that I call

182
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:08,420
mom more than I call you but I I call

183
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,460
you just as much and I call you when I

184
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,860
like really need it like when I need

185
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:16,250
advice because I trust your opinion and

186
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,110
I value it and sometimes I call mom just

187
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,270
to kind of like I'm walking from one

188
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,770
spot to another so you know just

189
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:27,740
shooting a shit and I do that with you

190
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:29,990
too but it's differently when I call you

191
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,870
get really excited and then you like you

192
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,520
know if I have a problem or anything I

193
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,290
know that you're not treating me like a

194
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,360
little kid anymore like you're coming at

195
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,790
it from an adult perspective and you

196
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,150
treat me like an equal usually

197
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:49,200
and mom comes at it in a different way

198
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,180
both are good but I just I value that

199
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,250
relationship that it's more of a respect

200
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,150
rather than mom still sometimes sees me

201
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,930
as like a little kid or or like her

202
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:03,690
friend and I don't think that were I

203
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,670
don't know that we're we're friends but

204
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,790
in a different way it's almost like

205
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,100
we're equals and you just you have a lot

206
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,020
more respect I think and you show it

207
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,380
differently than mom does if that makes

208
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,260
sense

209
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:20,460
well thank you for that I have

210
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,740
absolutely no jealousy when there's

211
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,660
interaction between you and Julie and

212
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:30,330
your mom or even some of your other

213
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:33,600
siblings first of all she what raised

214
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:36,000
you single-handedly my job had me out of

215
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,010
town all the time it's not that I wasn't

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,890
a good father I think I was but I was

217
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:46,620
away a lot and one of the things that's

218
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,840
most pleasing to me now is the really

219
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:54,030
excellent relationship that you and

220
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:55,980
Julie have with your mom and sure we

221
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,380
talk when it's necessary we talk just

222
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,180
when we feel like talking and I know

223
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,370
you're in touch with your mom every you

224
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,790
know all the time and that's exactly as

225
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,410
it should be so I would hope that you

226
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,330
keep that up when you don't call

227
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,090
sometimes you're away or something

228
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,480
I mean I'll shrug my shoulders but she

229
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,480
misses it

230
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,710
what was the hardest thing for you about

231
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,710
being a father

232
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:38,920
well I had a lot of hardships as a

233
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:43,740
father not so much with you with Julie

234
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:48,070
but with your older siblings and

235
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:52,900
certainly going back to your four oldest

236
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:54,900
siblings who had the same mother and and

237
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,980
that was a terrible terrible

238
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:05,260
relationship that I had with her and

239
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:07,270
coming from a broken home myself and my

240
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,930
kids saying retrospectively it was a

241
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:13,360
mistake but long after that marriage was

242
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,400
completely gone I stayed because I

243
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,170
thought that was best for your four

244
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:25,090
older siblings I don't have any regrets

245
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:26,470
about that okay I don't avoid people who

246
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,710
aren't getting along should not be

247
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,110
together but they need to also make take

248
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:36,250
serious consideration of children if

249
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:40,410
they have them so parenting your four

250
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:43,000
older siblings under those circumstances

251
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,310
were as you can imagine extremely

252
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,430
difficult I tried to be a good father

253
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,790
and I think I was I think if if you

254
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,880
would talk to your older siblings which

255
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,700
I know you do they don't they don't hold

256
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,520
anything against me so it's not so much

257
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,560
that but the question was what was you

258
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,520
know most difficult and it would have

259
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,290
been those times I didn't have really

260
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:14,770
very much difficulty with you and Julie

261
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:19,870
Julie was did her academics on her own

262
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:21,670
terms but certainly neither one of you

263
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,590
from that from the day you were born

264
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:30,480
caused either your mother or me

265
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:32,820
any any aggravation or anything no it's

266
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,700
true it's really true doesn't mean that

267
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:39,570
you always did exactly what you're

268
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:43,670
totally right but lucky saying thank the

269
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:46,050
older kids broke you in mm yeah no I

270
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:51,360
knew then and I know now and I know

271
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:53,250
retrospectively what a all children are

272
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,770
good unless they are made to be

273
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,330
otherwise but some whether it's

274
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,980
hereditary your upbringing or

275
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:03,870
environment or what have you or less

276
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:12,690
troublesome let's just saying in others

277
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:16,920
in our new engineer you just learn I

278
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:18,390
mean there weren't any problems yeah and

279
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,000
I can't say that but it what have you

280
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:25,500
all do she thinks it knit yes but the

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,380
other four they're all they're all fine

282
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,410
now so that's that's that's the good

283
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,110
news it's my turn yeah I'm taking from

284
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,600
here right yep

285
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:40,230
all right what's the most ridiculous

286
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:44,340
thing I've done what did it teach you

287
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:57,630
about me so you're gonna tell me if

288
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:59,040
that's our choice I think we used to

289
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,660
have family barbecues and you would

290
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:10,770
break those bricks at their head it was

291
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:12,630
just the most ridiculous but I think at

292
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:19,380
the time I remember being horribly

293
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:21,900
embarrassed and I'm scared for you but

294
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,720
now looking back I appreciate it

295
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,390
because you just didn't care you just

296
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,390
you had this like thing that you needed

297
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,790
to prove that you at least looking back

298
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,370
I take it that you were strong enough to

299
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,100
still do this and

300
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,630
you were you could and it was a pretty

301
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,960
cool parlor check anyway

302
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:46,640
but I appreciate that about you because

303
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,930
you've done it you did it when when you

304
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,700
found out that you were sick and you

305
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,830
still went to China and you went up the

306
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,450
Great Wall and you had to climb it and I

307
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,390
remember fighting with you about it

308
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,640
before when we were in Zion National

309
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,990
Park and being so angry with you but I

310
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,690
guess don't like stems from the same

311
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,790
thing that you like need to show people

312
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,070
that you can do it and I have that in me

313
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,630
so I guess like me that's part of the

314
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:12,700
reason that it pisses me off and you do

315
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,690
it but when I like look back at it I

316
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,320
appreciate that like in those moments

317
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:20,000
you don't that like you're just you need

318
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,150
to prove it to yourself in to everyone

319
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,550
else and you don't just kind of sit

320
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,380
still and say like the doctor told me

321
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,390
that this isn't gonna happen so it just

322
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,850
won't still think it wasn't the best

323
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,840
idea but I kind of appreciate that you

324
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:39,470
think you're a cowboy sometimes well

325
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,900
more often than not if I did that

326
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:55,250
whatever the setting it was because

327
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:56,990
somebody asked me to do it okay it

328
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,600
wasn't the little kids that the food

329
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,950
asked we was doing with me no but it was

330
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,210
the adults and I didn't know I was

331
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:08,090
embarrassing anybody but you know I

332
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,920
would also admit that every now and then

333
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,710
whatever the occasion it wasn't just at

334
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,250
our barbecues like if I felt that this

335
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,690
was that I wanted to show off I would

336
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,090
want to chase me to break a brick or

337
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,059
something like that so I would be

338
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,520
responding to somebody who is looking

339
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,960
back now the fact that you're like 60

340
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,790
something-year-old father could smash a

341
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,820
brick with his head is what kind of a

342
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:35,179
kind of cool like I can say that I think

343
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,920
I probably could still do it I was it's

344
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:41,630
hard to find a brick around the house

345
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:45,530
that he wore your mom hides him but yeah

346
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:47,390
I mean if somebody asked me now I would

347
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,980
still do it

348
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,600
and when the time comes that I can't

349
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,590
anymore which is probably not that far

350
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:00,870
often so--but please know brick-breaking

351
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:09,290
I have to blow my nose get you'll be

352
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:12,930
able to edit that I'm sorry about that

353
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:17,250
it is allergy something triggering my

354
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:23,280
own okay okay what's the greatest lesson

355
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:28,880
I taught you and that's it that's a good

356
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:34,080
question the egg teaching the chicken or

357
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:39,420
the grasshopper teaching the what I've

358
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:45,360
learned from you is patience and poise

359
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:50,040
and at times I have that and sometimes

360
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,760
if I'm angry I may disguise it

361
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,790
deliberately or not not have it you

362
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,910
don't lose your you you do get stressed

363
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:02,190
and I mentioned that earlier because you

364
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,590
expect so much of yourself and you

365
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,020
expect such a level of organization that

366
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,380
when it's not happening you can become

367
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:14,480
stressed but you're always poised you're

368
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:18,300
always in control of yourself

369
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,010
you're always respectful of others now I

370
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,530
wouldn't say that you've taught me that

371
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,140
that's something I tried to instill in

372
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:28,410
all my children but then seeing that

373
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:33,480
reflected in you it makes me very very

374
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:39,560
proud so in my mind you're all but a

375
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,560
human a perfect human being in my mind

376
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,420
to a large degree I think that that's

377
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,300
more than in my mind but that's still in

378
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,630
the ibises of the b-and-b o beholder and

379
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:56,700
clearly there's some prejudice on my

380
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:59,210
part but you know you are for anybody

381
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,470
and myself included

382
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,380
I'm going to use a word that you

383
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:10,020
probably expected to be used anyway you

384
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:13,610
are the quintessential example of a just

385
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,610
a really good decent person

386
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,809
what are you hesitant to tell me now

387
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,809
that's a good one

388
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:44,090
I don't think there's anything I like

389
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,090
I'm pretty open and honest with you

390
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:59,989
anything that I haven't already told you

391
00:23:53,669 --> 00:24:03,570
I think going into the wedding I was

392
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:07,950
hesitant to tell you how strongly I

393
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:10,950
didn't want to do it but I think at this

394
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,200
point that's already come and I think

395
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,629
I'm past that part and I'm excited I'm

396
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,340
happy for it but generally speaking I

397
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:22,259
feel like you know I don't certainly

398
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,049
feel that you withhold much from me so

399
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:33,539
that that comports with you know what I

400
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:34,559
perceive how am I most like you and how

401
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:43,470
does that scare you

402
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:46,049
oh well you have a lot of your mom in

403
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:52,679
you but you certainly have plenty of me

404
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:56,249
I think maybe the thing that I'd be most

405
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:59,639
concerned of a characteristic which I

406
00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:02,070
know that we share is sensitivity yeah

407
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:05,879
and that's why sometimes when we are

408
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:13,019
talking we'll say something you to me or

409
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:15,239
I to you and it will disturb or hurt

410
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:22,440
even the other person the other party

411
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:24,450
and we probably you know oftentimes what

412
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,289
happens is we'll say something you could

413
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,419
text something and then realize you know

414
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:33,229
this was hurtful when I want to send

415
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:37,049
back and either explain it or apologize

416
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:40,590
but should either one of us be as

417
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:42,869
sensitive as we are I don't think either

418
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,499
one of us could be anything else but

419
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:49,830
that is I don't know that I've past

420
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:51,149
doing any traits to you not if you've

421
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,759
had all of them you'd have putti

422
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,710
negative traits but I don't perceive

423
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,500
that I've passed on any traits to you

424
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,380
that are

425
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,200
you know really negative or detrimental

426
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:06,240
to your your living your life that one

427
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:11,170
though I think is is an obvious to me I

428
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,890
think I have another one and it's only

429
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,640
with you

430
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,910
good stubbornness like anime beauty

431
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,100
comes from the sensitivity thing but you

432
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,320
like sometimes approach things as if

433
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,060
you're still negotiating like you're

434
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,670
still debating everything and it's a

435
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:31,210
battle and I get to a point where I just

436
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:33,730
I I want you to see my side of it and

437
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:36,370
you won't back down and oh it's so

438
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,960
stubborn and that's from you cuz mom

439
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:43,630
doesn't have it mom will just kind of

440
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:46,420
feel like okay you think by generally

441
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,030
speaking I only do it with you well I'm

442
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,040
certainly I don't wouldn't call it

443
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,990
argumentative but if I'm if I feel that

444
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,150
I'm because argumentative just implies

445
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,860
you just you know you're all I could

446
00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:01,450
about everything like that it's more

447
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:03,550
like as if you're I mean I never saw you

448
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,340
in action at work but I can imagine I

449
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,020
mean your job was to basically to meet

450
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,970
with people and have them see your side

451
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,970
and sometimes you translate that into

452
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,470
your day-to-day life and you certainly

453
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,870
do that with your family because I think

454
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,790
we're a bit more forgiving and then

455
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:23,530
everyone else seems to just be like okay

456
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:25,300
dad that's fine yeah I engaged felonies

457
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,490
probably shouldn't I don't know that it

458
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,830
relates to anything so much that I did

459
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:34,480
at work from when I was growing up I was

460
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:38,560
if I had an opinion I was pretty pretty

461
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,650
much willing to stand by it go back a

462
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,050
far enough and then I grew up in a rough

463
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,570
neighborhood sometimes that would be did

464
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:50,100
the supporting my opinion might involved

465
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:53,860
you know a little physical interaction

466
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:56,110
but not more often and even as I was

467
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,230
going through school when I had an

468
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:02,740
opinion I would pretty much try to

469
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:06,640
defend it but others may not see me that

470
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,900
way and you may not but I see myself as

471
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:15,690
first of all

472
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:17,130
almost completely logical so that some

473
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,460
things have nothing to do with logic

474
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:23,820
just what you think but if somebody

475
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,710
proves me wrong I do back wolf now like

476
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,850
I do recall I don't know if it was you

477
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:31,890
or Julie I did one of one of you your

478
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,790
brothers and sisters and it might have

479
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:39,900
been several of you would say to me we

480
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:41,640
would get into a discussion because I

481
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,440
would say to all of you if you want to

482
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,690
do something or not do something you

483
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,760
know make your case yeah your mom would

484
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,830
just say no you can't do it sometimes

485
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,180
you know I would say no let's listen

486
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:58,530
right in those cases you're very

487
00:28:51,180 --> 00:29:00,780
rational but every now and then in it's

488
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,130
not necessarily that setting but one of

489
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,290
you would say to me well you're not

490
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:09,360
being feared dad quote you lose your

491
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:11,790
using logic well I mean other than you

492
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,300
that said it but if it happened a few

493
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:20,340
times over your mom never said that she

494
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:23,640
probably thinks it my turn yeah I like

495
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:26,240
this game nut game I mean whatever it is

496
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,240
thank you

497
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:35,799
when or what was the toughest

498
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:41,110
relationship that took toughest moment

499
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:48,610
in your relationship in air it is air

500
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:51,159
yes thank you I think when I was leaving

501
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:54,039
for South America

502
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,890
you were just so deceivingly so

503
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:59,080
disappointed and the fact that I was

504
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:03,100
like had been going on this trajectory

505
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:05,799
that was so by-the-book and I had this

506
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:09,610
relationship and I had a good job

507
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:12,490
and I didn't really console with you or

508
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:15,220
mom I just did it for the most part it

509
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,809
was kind of like I'm booking this ticket

510
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,490
it was more of a courtesy call rather

511
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:20,950
than a discussion and I think I had

512
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,450
never really done that before and I

513
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:26,110
think I was probably scaring you a

514
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:29,769
little bit that I did it um we didn't

515
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,990
talk very much when I went you know come

516
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:33,940
with me to the airport and like even the

517
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,320
day before you were asking me if like I

518
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,000
would stay and I was like I already

519
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,210
booked a ticket and you said I'll pay

520
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,389
for you to not go and part of it I think

521
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,760
was ingest but I think you were not

522
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:48,480
happy with the decision that I made and

523
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,940
you didn't do a very good job of

524
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,159
covering that up which is fine but I the

525
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,409
feeling of disappointing you I think was

526
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,590
the hardest part well I think you

527
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:01,870
misinterpreted that it's not that I had

528
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,269
I mean you had a good job at the time I

529
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,529
had a good how you were fortunate enough

530
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:08,070
to have a good job right out of college

531
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:11,409
and you just gave that up

532
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:14,649
that was not my main concern because I I

533
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:18,220
knew that you could get any job you're

534
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:20,980
worried I mean as far as like being

535
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,389
supportive you weren't and I never had

536
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,419
you not be supportive you're usually

537
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:27,519
kind of like my biggest cheerleader and

538
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:31,149
you weren't in that moment and you

539
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,820
probably didn't realize it but it was

540
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:35,320
that was tough and I wasn't I didn't

541
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,789
want to have to convince you otherwise

542
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,220
because I understood where you were

543
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:41,679
coming from but I remember you saying

544
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,040
you know asking whether Sebastian and I

545
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,410
would say

546
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,540
together and I said I didn't know and if

547
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,250
we didn't then we weren't meant to be

548
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,410
together that this is something I had to

549
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,820
do and you didn't like that response and

550
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,600
you didn't like that he wasn't coming

551
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,490
and you were meant reminded me that beds

552
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,250
get cold when people are away I think of

553
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,800
what you said well and it ended up being

554
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,720
true I mean we weren't a good fit but

555
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,340
I'm gone I want had i not left i

556
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,890
wouldn't have realized that i wouldn't

557
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,420
be where I am now if I hadn't done it I

558
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,440
who knows where I would have been I

559
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:16,320
would have been happy well

560
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,970
retrospectively and I'm not sure I was

561
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:24,690
aware of all that you're saying now your

562
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:28,030
feelings but what I remember the most

563
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:31,120
wasn't so much a concern about how you

564
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:34,540
would you know get away with your career

565
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,820
I had complete faith in you with in that

566
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:41,470
respect I was concerned about your

567
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:46,480
well-being I was until the end and you

568
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:48,490
came back and again it's this is not

569
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,020
retrospective this actually happened

570
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,680
yeah I did raise a question about

571
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:56,500
whether relationship of I think it was

572
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,310
five years by that point you know

573
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:05,020
between two young people could survive

574
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:06,640
being away that wall so and and and as

575
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,650
you say now maybe that would have broken

576
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,370
up anyway but that actually did come to

577
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:14,740
pass 14 I currently needed to leave for

578
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:17,170
five months six months right now I have

579
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,940
no doubt that I would my relationship

580
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,570
would be fine I was with the wrong

581
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,560
person

582
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:26,020
neither do I okay that's them but but in

583
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,990
terms of Sebastian that's hindsight but

584
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:32,050
the other thing that in fact I did

585
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:34,590
predict was I was concerned for your

586
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,970
well-being in in two regards

587
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,550
unfortunately that came to pass you were

588
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:43,570
pretty seriously mom it's a fortunately

589
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:46,140
weren't injured but when you were in

590
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,830
Uruguay what do you require wouldn't it

591
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,370
okay Ecuador

592
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:54,190
and and then the other thing is that a

593
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:58,630
terrible terrible

594
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:04,120
I guess it was a fungus right yeah that

595
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:06,760
you had which was a major problem could

596
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,669
have actually cost your life in fact of

597
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,750
course I don't mean money-wise cost but

598
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:15,250
the major sin valve major surgery now

599
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,320
nobody necessarily could have predicted

600
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,090
that so I'm not saying you know what we

601
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,470
could walk out in the street right now I

602
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,240
got hit by a car

603
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,919
it was just like I've never felt more

604
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,850
sure about something in my life and when

605
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,590
I made that decision and you were so

606
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:32,139
against it and so obviously against it

607
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:34,720
and you're like use no filter it was

608
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:37,240
just it was tough you know you I want

609
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,010
you to be proud of me and I want you to

610
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,810
support things that I'm doing and that

611
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,760
was a moment when you didn't and I

612
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,500
understand I don't know how that would

613
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,500
feel and I understand where you're

614
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,210
coming from with all of it but as your

615
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:53,050
daughter as someone that had to like

616
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:57,910
hear some of that feedback a lot of it

617
00:34:53,050 --> 00:35:00,460
being kind of cold was ah I'm very sorry

618
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:04,060
if that's either the way I was or the

619
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:06,160
way you perceived it I was very proud of

620
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,870
what you were doing and I would brag

621
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,500
about you all the time during that

622
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:13,510
six-month period and before and after

623
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,640
you know how you were you weren't

624
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:22,060
getting paid and you were really working

625
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:23,890
with negative native peoples and you you

626
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,260
know you were working for nonprofits and

627
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:30,460
you were you were not trying but you

628
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:32,710
didn't work helping people so I was very

629
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:39,790
proud of what you were doing I was also

630
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:48,330
proud that a young woman of weird 25 had

631
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:55,450
the was courageous enough to undertake a

632
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:57,880
venture like that in adventure and we

633
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,560
cool exactly being as negative as you

634
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,490
describe me but I'm not sounding that

635
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:06,100
that's where you perceive me but if so I

636
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,950
got over it very quickly I didn't

637
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:11,060
until you came back I didn't get over

638
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:15,860
you know being concerned for your

639
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:17,360
well-being but beyond that and of course

640
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,100
the thing with Sebastian that was

641
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,869
playing out as you were down there and

642
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:27,920
that that pretty obviously at this point

643
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:30,020
was meant to be but I was very proud of

644
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,880
you for what you did and I am I am now

645
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:43,720
I'm sorry if I didn't project that at

646
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:43,720
the proper time it's not to be Seavers

647
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:57,350
what did you learn from your parents

648
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:59,060
that you wish you could forget might be

649
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,890
a more appropriate question if I said

650
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,380
what what do you want to remember about

651
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:06,880
your parents and your upbringing now I

652
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,860
want to quickly qualify that my mother

653
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:15,290
who at a point in time was a single

654
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:17,420
mother of six at a time when women were

655
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,810
not very often in the workplace and

656
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:25,490
certainly not what six kids anyway and

657
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:29,810
my father would he wasn't totally out of

658
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:34,670
the picture but he he hardly supported

659
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:43,040
us and we didn't see him very often but

660
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:46,100
I mean we we were the fact that we were

661
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,030
as poor as we were I mean at least at a

662
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,780
time

663
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:53,660
I am my five siblings you know got

664
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:56,240
closer and because of that my mother was

665
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,060
a person that didn't have an evil bone

666
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,410
in her body not a mean bone

667
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:10,030
body my father let's finish what him was

668
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:13,840
not much of a father so I did learn from

669
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:17,260
him when I said earlier that I stayed

670
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:20,110
with a wife that really wasn't intended

671
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,210
that was more the course of going up

672
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:24,310
that way in that situation he abandoned

673
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:29,650
us so I wasn't going to do that to my

674
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:32,230
you know my kids my mother was nothing

675
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:34,710
if she wasn't the kindest most decent

676
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:39,130
person in the world but she had habits

677
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:41,170
that would just drive people crazy in

678
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:46,060
general and certainly drives me and my

679
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:50,250
brothers and sisters crazy I think we've

680
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:55,180
talked about some of them so I'll just

681
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:58,450
review one that to this day she had this

682
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:02,380
thing that if you drank water with your

683
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:05,920
food any meal anytime snack it was

684
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:08,740
unhealthy you should not be done so that

685
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,760
whatever food we have at any given time

686
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:19,480
we were permitted and then she would get

687
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:21,280
us tea kool-aid and any with just sugar

688
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,510
water and it's the worst thing for you

689
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,330
soda was certainly fine not water okay

690
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,250
until the day she died may she rest in

691
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:34,840
peace she never changed their mind on

692
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:37,690
that so you know growing up you don't

693
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,280
have to maybe when you're young enough

694
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,140
you just accept that your mother's

695
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,480
telling you they're at a point in time

696
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:49,620
something that's obviously so just

697
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,090
absolutely unacceptable

698
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,280
becomes a problematic when it keeps

699
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:57,010
coming back and back and back over and

700
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,650
over again so I'm just you know giving

701
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:02,400
one example I'm most most children

702
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:06,640
remember annoyances from their mothers

703
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,380
but I also remember is that without a

704
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,209
father she raised six of us

705
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:16,759
and I loved her dearly I'd miss her

706
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:19,459
I probably didn't always treat her as

707
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:23,180
well as I should have because of some of

708
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:24,979
these annoying things which would you

709
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,440
know as a young as a teenager and

710
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:34,420
preteen Andrew they're difficult to

711
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,420
accept so what was the question

712
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:43,579
yeah well I think I've given you a same

713
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,170
thing there's not I I think what it's

714
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:48,259
not a question of passing one if you're

715
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:50,059
talking about genes you you remind me

716
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:54,529
you're named after my mother and you

717
00:40:50,059 --> 00:41:00,140
remind me of her you're a sweet and kind

718
00:40:54,529 --> 00:41:05,599
in some sense you look like her new CD

719
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:09,549
teachers but some of those traits that

720
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,549
she had and certainly that my father had

721
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:14,289
we want to pay uh someone to anybody

722
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,300
what mistakes do you see me making that

723
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:31,020
you have also made what would you advise

724
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,020
me to do

725
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:55,819
um I think you're a little too hard on

726
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,270
yourself sometimes which you criticize

727
00:41:55,819 --> 00:42:03,160
me for being we do it in different ways

728
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:06,650
but I think you're really worried that

729
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:10,280
your weren't good enough father or that

730
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,530
you made too many mistakes or that you

731
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,750
weren't around enough and then maybe

732
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,359
you'd be remembered like that and that's

733
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,950
just not the case and you're really hard

734
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,619
on yourself with that I think you should

735
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:27,260
cut yourself a break I think you're

736
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:31,760
pretty much ready to home with that I

737
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:34,309
also don't you know I'm not totally down

738
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,440
on myself I've used seven children

739
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:42,440
first of all with three different

740
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,339
mothers but the word half is never used

741
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,380
in our family and you're as close with

742
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:51,140
your half-sister lincei is you would be

743
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,720
with as you are with Julie who's your

744
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,630
full sister that's to your credit I'm

745
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,450
saying you like made us stay a family

746
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,359
and I don't know anyone else that could

747
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:04,339
say that or a few people I mean I know

748
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:08,299
siblings that are full that aren't as

749
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:12,559
close as we are and people make mistakes

750
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:14,000
you make any that are any other parent

751
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,099
wouldn't have made you're just you're

752
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,079
really hard on yourself about all of

753
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:25,400
that I don't think you should be well

754
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:27,170
I'm certainly not so so modest or hard

755
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,799
on myself that I wouldn't admit to that

756
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:34,420
and boast and brag about it even I do

757
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:37,760
feel that the closeness and the family

758
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:40,640
ties that the seven of you and

759
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,950
consequently my grandchildren your

760
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,369
nieces and nephews and and even the

761
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:49,849
great-grandchildren that's something

762
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:51,740
that was instilled in everybody and he's

763
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:52,839
pretty tough it dissipates it hasn't

764
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,190
happened yet

765
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,730
all of those people will be at your

766
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,170
wedding there's not a one of them you

767
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,510
know

768
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,220
I can't make it or this is that nobody

769
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:06,040
even thinks that they wouldn't be at

770
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,480
your wedding and and that's what kind of

771
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,740
family that you have and you wouldn't

772
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:15,069
think that you wouldn't be somebody

773
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:16,809
else's let's say serious you have said

774
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:21,190
in the past like regrets that you've had

775
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:24,730
about with raising any number of us and

776
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:26,950
I just I don't think you should have

777
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:29,440
them I mean you've said me we should

778
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:31,150
have been around more for Nick or you

779
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,849
shouldn't have been as hard on the older

780
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:36,520
for kids for any number of things and I

781
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:38,589
just you were a parent you were a young

782
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:42,970
parent and I just think that you made

783
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:45,369
mistakes as anyone would have but no one

784
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:49,450
sees you like that we all see you as a

785
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:51,369
really good father and we we recognize

786
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:54,099
the fact that we are so close as a

787
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:56,109
result of you telling us that family is

788
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:57,970
the most important and you should be

789
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:00,849
proud of that because we're proud of it

790
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:04,089
I am very proud of that I don't see

791
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:05,799
myself you know in a completely opposite

792
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:08,470
or negative if I don't see myself as a

793
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:11,230
terrible father I just have regrets that

794
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,730
as any or all of you we're growing up

795
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:18,490
that certain things could have been

796
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:20,770
right deal so it can't get that back I'm

797
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:24,790
certainly not I'm certainly pleased with

798
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,510
the products seven times over so that's

799
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:29,309
not the issue

800
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:32,220
oh you turned out to be yeah wonderful I

801
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:39,190
wouldn't change any one of you at all

802
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:42,970
maybe Goods girlfriend's boy I hope it

803
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:46,210
gets back to Glenn it's not anything I

804
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:52,329
haven't said to God but now other than

805
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:57,460
that I'm completely really completely

806
00:45:52,329 --> 00:46:00,400
satisfied with the who all of you are so

807
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,049
in that regard I'm also not stupid I

808
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,750
have to take some credit for that

809
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:08,109
right but there are still plenty plenty

810
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:09,019
plenty regrets that I did do things or

811
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:10,269
didn't do things

812
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:26,419
you know could have done some things

813
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:39,549
differently yours or mine what quality

814
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:45,679
do you wish my fiance had but doesn't I

815
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:49,549
I know rich pretty well and if he has

816
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:53,119
qualities or doesn't have Galax

817
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:58,309
qualities that are important to him in

818
00:46:53,119 --> 00:47:03,919
you in your life together I don't know

819
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:06,529
of them you know having said that there

820
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:08,419
is one courted turning around the

821
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:13,999
question but I've said this to you too

822
00:47:08,419 --> 00:47:19,609
into him the one quality that he he does

823
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:22,639
have which perhaps at least your last

824
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:27,319
boyfriend didn't and consequently he

825
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:31,759
lost you okay now maybe that was meant

826
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:33,949
to be you know but he still hasn't

827
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:38,689
gotten over that you know it was too

828
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:40,880
late well okay and by the way as you

829
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,819
well know I did not I don't have

830
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,189
anything against Sebastian so it's it's

831
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:51,949
not that kind of a thing but what I

832
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:54,429
perceived is that he didn't I don't see

833
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:54,429
you as

834
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:39,230
okay Sebastian I won't use his specific

835
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,210
thing but because it actually

836
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,140
disappeared a couple other of your

837
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:45,349
boyfriend's too

838
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:50,589
and they didn't know what it it takes

839
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:50,589
for a man to please a woman and

840
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:58,640
presumably to hold on to that woman if

841
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:00,230
he wants to do that now if he's just

842
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,089
playing or doesn't care than they did

843
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:08,990
you know how much does it matter but in

844
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:13,880
the case of rich what I've observed

845
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:17,809
about him and what I believe is and will

846
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,460
be the case is that he loves you very

847
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:21,680
much

848
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,539
you don't want to lose him for sure but

849
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:29,779
he certainly does not want to lose you

850
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:32,740
and he's he's smart enough it's not just

851
00:49:29,779 --> 00:49:37,779
you know mental smartness but he's

852
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:46,819
clever enough to do whatever it takes to

853
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:48,759
make sure that you do stay with him and

854
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:51,799
that was not necessarily a trait of his

855
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:56,740
predecessors and the result of it was

856
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:59,859
that you know they they did lose you and

857
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:02,690
of course I'm prejudiced about you but

858
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:07,609
I'd feel sorry for any man that loses

859
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:10,279
you it's just like he's a fighter and he

860
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:11,880
was just do you like makes it clear what

861
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:17,460
it is that he wants

862
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:19,050
and you like gorgeous for a team I was

863
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,480
I've never been a team like that before

864
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:23,250
it's different no it doesn't need to be

865
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,710
like a comparison between him and

866
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:27,720
everyone well what's the question

867
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:31,740
actually I turned around because I

868
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,260
really don't have any knowledge

869
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,660
I'm sure he has some faults don't we all

870
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:40,830
but I don't have any knowledge of any

871
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:43,020
faults and certainly none that have you

872
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:45,680
know come between you and him in your

873
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,680
relationship

874
00:50:52,250 --> 00:51:00,000
what's something I could do that would

875
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,810
make you refuse to ever talk to me again

876
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,810
well

877
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,380
okay what's the one piece of advice you

878
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:20,570
have for me regarding a successful

879
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:24,430
marriage no I sort of touched on it

880
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:28,610
before but the implication is not that

881
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:31,550
rich or the main is the one that has the

882
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:37,130
total responsibility of making a

883
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:44,110
marriage work and what I really said

884
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:47,480
about him knowing how to keep a woman I

885
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:51,410
would say that about you too

886
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,330
in reference to him and did I said you

887
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:55,730
know you you want to keep him being once

888
00:51:53,330 --> 00:52:01,100
keep you and if you want you want to

889
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:05,330
keep him then you it's not a question of

890
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:08,300
acquiescing or being bullied or anything

891
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:14,630
like that clearly those are unacceptable

892
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:18,140
behaviors but you should do everything

893
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:26,740
that's possible to make the person that

894
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:26,740
you love happy within reason okay

895
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:35,160
what have I done or what happened to me

896
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:46,200
that scared you the most

897
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:48,450
why because I said before that it was

898
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,069
something I appreciated about you sort

899
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,720
of but when you went to China and you

900
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:57,030
didn't listen to us and then you fell

901
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:59,760
that was scary but I mean I wish it

902
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:06,420
hadn't happened I don't know that I wish

903
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:09,059
you hadn't gone I think I just I don't

904
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,950
know you're you're not going anywhere

905
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,990
anytime soon but you are getting older

906
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:16,559
and that scares me and I just don't want

907
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:19,619
anything to happen to you so it just

908
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,510
felt reckless when you found out you

909
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:27,839
were sick and the doctor said for you to

910
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:28,680
stay and then you were like oh I need to

911
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,569
go to China

912
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,970
I need to do that and in a weird way I

913
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:34,589
can appreciate it I think I could at the

914
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:39,150
time even as I was fighting with you

915
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:41,000
about it but I just I knew if the tables

916
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,230
were turned you would never have

917
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,220
advocated for me to do that you would

918
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,170
have wanted me to start getting

919
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,710
treatment immediately and fix everything

920
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:56,760
and make it better and it was hard for

921
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:59,430
me to know that you that that wasn't

922
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,740
your first priority or maybe you just

923
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,980
you look felt like you were invincible

924
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:08,910
or something and it just scared me that

925
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:11,220
something was gonna happen and then when

926
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:17,369
you fell because like all the way worse

927
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:18,930
fear is happening at one time I think I

928
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:21,030
forgot what the question was what was

929
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:26,010
the question something I did that scared

930
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:28,950
you I think that was probably it

931
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:31,260
scared you yet this yeah I think just

932
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,290
you and again I understand it there

933
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:37,680
isn't even an explanation but I just

934
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:42,329
it's I think sometimes you don't put

935
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:47,579
your health first like when you hardly

936
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:51,210
ever get sick and so when you do you you

937
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:53,910
act like that you know like what you say

938
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:55,740
like I can never get sick or something

939
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:57,450
like that and it's just it's not the

940
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:00,450
case I mean it's funny when we're like

941
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:01,980
little kids and you say it but I'm not a

942
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:05,849
little kid anymore and when you're

943
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:09,450
actually sick and something could really

944
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:13,200
happen it just felt so selfish I think

945
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:15,599
in that moment that you left which is

946
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,180
not fair it wasn't fair of me to look at

947
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,829
it like that but I just if God forbid

948
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,109
something had happened to you

949
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:24,119
and you came back and the treatment had

950
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:25,740
started too late and something happened

951
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,510
and you weren't here I think it would

952
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:31,109
have been really hard for me to forgive

953
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:33,410
that I do appreciate what you're saying

954
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:36,180
of course you shared that opinion with

955
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:42,900
not so much your mom she was convinced

956
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:45,690
but your other siblings but I did act on

957
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:49,290
the advice of doctors I just didn't go

958
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:52,170
away as a renegade so I know just wasn't

959
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,760
the safest thing yes the accident I had

960
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:56,309
in China nothing to do with the other

961
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,140
you know that was just but that's still

962
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:59,910
sort of stems from the same thing it

963
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,510
still stems from you being stubborn and

964
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:05,880
like needing to climb to the top and

965
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:08,520
needing to do that and it's it's like a

966
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,010
downfall and a positive because I

967
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,829
appreciate that you do that and that you

968
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:16,530
are a fighter I mean I have that from

969
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:17,970
you a mom like you guys just fight when

970
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:22,680
everything was happening with my lung

971
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:24,690
and I like I remember how scared you

972
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,150
guys were and it was like we've flipped

973
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:29,069
roles I was like no it's gonna be fine I

974
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,470
have this it's taken care of I'm going

975
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:33,450
to I'm going into surgery tomorrow you

976
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,710
just need to hear that I mean I have

977
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:37,020
that from you guys and

978
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:39,680
I appreciate that quality but when the

979
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:42,119
tables are turned and it feels like you

980
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,500
like something really terrible could

981
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:46,530
have happened and I had no control over

982
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:49,849
it I didn't I mean what would I have

983
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:54,869
done if you weren't here you know

984
00:56:49,849 --> 00:57:00,900
well I'm gratified by how you feel how

985
00:56:54,869 --> 00:57:04,980
you felt that would be do whatever to

986
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:08,339
tell you what I don't care so it's not

987
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:13,230
that I wasn't aware of how all of you

988
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:15,450
felt but again I wasn't not to put us

989
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,430
through torture during that time well

990
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:19,170
you really didn't want to do that you

991
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,359
know that's the thing I understand why

992
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:24,750
you did it but it was awful like going

993
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,070
through it it was really scary like just

994
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,630
having that in the back of our heads

995
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:29,670
that you were delaying treatment and

996
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,460
then we knew like when the accident

997
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:34,200
happened and everything it's just it was

998
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,970
like our worst fears were like all

999
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,770
happening at the same time and it was

1000
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:40,970
and then to have you come back and be

1001
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:44,520
like feel like you would kind of like

1002
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:46,830
basically seen death almost is like you

1003
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,859
described it at that time it was just I

1004
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:52,200
was so upset and like angry with you for

1005
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:54,240
having done that and again looking back

1006
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,760
it's everything worked out and it's hard

1007
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:00,060
for me to like feel still feel that way

1008
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:02,400
but I was it's one of a few times that I

1009
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:06,230
was really angry with you for having

1010
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:11,700
because it just felt so selfish well

1011
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:19,580
your mom with me made the decision to

1012
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:19,580
parcel out updates on my condition and

1013
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:27,540
ward or not it was a she that made that

1014
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:30,470
decision I think it was exactly the

1015
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,730
appropriate thing to do now of course I

1016
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,859
know what's going through you but yeah

1017
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:37,440
but if I didn't how would you feel we've

1018
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:39,119
had that discussion but under the

1019
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,500
circumstances it wasn't like I was

1020
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,560
around the corner where you know I

1021
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:49,630
I was in China there was a lot anybody

1022
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:51,820
could do it was just the decision to go

1023
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:55,120
the other part of it was unforeseen but

1024
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:57,610
the reason why you fell is the same

1025
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,100
reason as to as like why you went it's

1026
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:02,050
like you needed to just show that you

1027
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,700
could do it that you were not strong and

1028
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,620
sometimes I wish you would just do it

1029
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,800
and you did do it and that's the point

1030
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:11,410
like I I can appreciate it and it also

1031
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,990
just frustrates me at the same time

1032
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:16,180
because so much of it could have the

1033
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:18,580
anxiety they like all of us went through

1034
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:22,210
could have been avoided but I understand

1035
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:24,370
why you did it I do I just well I just

1036
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:30,070
wish it hadn't happened it was awful

1037
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:31,390
I do understand I'm not gonna say if

1038
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,680
something like that happened it would be

1039
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:34,600
different because nothing like that's

1040
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:39,220
going to happen anymore I was it's an

1041
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:43,450
easy hollow promise to make but I can't

1042
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:49,140
really say that in either of those

1043
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:52,270
circumstances in the first case I had

1044
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:55,300
specific permission by several doctors

1045
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:57,970
okay they assured me that putting it off

1046
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:02,290
for a few weeks was not going to worsen

1047
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:04,180
the problem and I know how you felt your

1048
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:07,150
mother felt that way too up to a point

1049
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:13,870
then she just sort of backed off the

1050
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:18,120
accident I had in China we were walking

1051
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:22,120
a narrow line there I mean if I were

1052
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:25,170
close to dying or something a problem we

1053
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:28,960
even if your mom had from the beginning

1054
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:32,170
and I shouldn't say if I were I perhaps

1055
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:35,320
was at one point but you've got over it

1056
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:41,050
quickly I wasn't I wasn't in danger and

1057
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:44,530
a point of dying and if your mother had

1058
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:47,420
publicized that from the get-go there

1059
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:52,220
would been the next day seven or more

1060
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:54,410
no trips to China point I see yeah I

1061
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,510
don't say about missing the point it's

1062
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,579
just like all of that happened and

1063
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:01,460
that's fine it's just I wish you hadn't

1064
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:03,230
done it I wish you hadn't made the

1065
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:06,319
decision to go everything that happened

1066
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:08,329
from there on is to totally it's

1067
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,579
somewhat removed there's the fact that

1068
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:14,210
you went I wish you hadn't done that I

1069
01:01:10,579 --> 01:01:16,280
wish you hadn't needed to take that risk

1070
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,960
like I would hope that if something like

1071
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,579
that ever happened again in your face

1072
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,980
with that decision that you'd remember

1073
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:24,049
that there are a lot of people that care

1074
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:26,510
about you being here and if the tables

1075
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:28,099
were turned and a doctor said you can

1076
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:29,359
start treatment immediately or you can

1077
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:32,150
start treatment in three weeks you'd

1078
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:47,809
have me there the next second if I could

1079
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:49,490
that's my point okay points what what

1080
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:57,430
are you worried about for me and my

1081
01:01:49,490 --> 01:02:02,299
future I don't worry about a lot for you

1082
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:08,869
because of past experiences and your

1083
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:12,829
past performance I think you positioned

1084
01:02:08,869 --> 01:02:15,140
yourself career-wise to where you're

1085
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:19,520
embarking in a you know a new venture

1086
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:23,000
now but you you have your skills and

1087
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,589
your experience and you've distinguished

1088
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,569
yourself and just about everything

1089
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:31,730
you've done so I don't worry that if

1090
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:33,349
something happened with your you know

1091
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:36,770
attempt at a business or anything else

1092
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:40,609
you you always have the capacity to take

1093
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:45,049
care of yourself so I don't really I

1094
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:50,569
don't really worry about any of that I'm

1095
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:53,569
worried about your health I know that

1096
01:02:50,569 --> 01:02:57,049
you take very good care of yourself but

1097
01:02:53,569 --> 01:03:00,399
I still worry about your health

1098
01:02:57,049 --> 01:03:07,309
and worry about your state of mind

1099
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:12,229
worried that that you sometimes just

1100
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:14,509
become overly stressed because you're

1101
01:03:12,229 --> 01:03:17,269
you know I've said this before but

1102
01:03:14,509 --> 01:03:18,739
you're so organized that when you know

1103
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:23,479
something this big and the scheme of

1104
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:25,999
things is amiss for you sometimes not

1105
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:29,119
all the times it becomes a major cause

1106
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:36,130
of stress and I worry about that I wish

1107
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:39,169
you had the capacity to just dismiss it

1108
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:42,589
just not to expect such perfection from

1109
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:44,439
yourself but you usually get it from

1110
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:46,909
yourself that's the thing it's not like

1111
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:50,089
you know here's a sloppy person looking

1112
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:57,130
for perfection you generally are pretty

1113
01:03:50,089 --> 01:03:57,130
much perfection like turn

1114
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:24,480
that's for you thank you for first okay

1115
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:34,029
what's one thing you've learned from my

1116
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,420
relationships that you'll carry into

1117
01:04:34,029 --> 01:04:36,420
yours

1118
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:56,309
family first I think like beyond I'm

1119
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,460
seeking more broadly than you and mom

1120
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:02,549
but I just I think I've learned from you

1121
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:09,089
how the importance of family and keeping

1122
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:14,400
everyone together and just unconditional

1123
01:05:09,089 --> 01:05:15,930
love because you have that usually when

1124
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,280
someone really pisses you off and they

1125
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:22,500
you know family and unconditional life

1126
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:28,829
well if you've learned those two things

1127
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:35,220
I'm a success what do you see in my

1128
01:05:28,829 --> 01:05:36,960
future ten years from now well let's

1129
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:44,089
start with the obvious ten years from

1130
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:50,160
now hmm five six kids grandchildren

1131
01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:54,530
no I think in 10 years I'll see at least

1132
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:59,670
a grandchild maybe more and maybe not

1133
01:05:54,530 --> 01:06:04,430
but that that's what I would predict

1134
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:05,809
I see continued success in whatever

1135
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:08,010
[Music]

1136
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:15,089
financial or business ventures you're

1137
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:17,130
entering into because that tendency for

1138
01:06:15,089 --> 01:06:19,650
perfection that I described as sometimes

1139
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:23,940
being a negative it's certainly not all

1140
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:27,799
negative and you have demonstrated in

1141
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:31,170
the past that you have the capacity to

1142
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:32,819
distinguish yourself in anything that

1143
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:35,339
you've tried to do and that's all

1144
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:38,790
inclusive I don't recall ever your

1145
01:06:35,339 --> 01:06:42,809
having you know attempted to do

1146
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:45,390
something and again not distinguishing

1147
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:48,390
yourself yourself I recall your having

1148
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:52,680
given some things up but not not

1149
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:54,800
distinguishing yourself and of course

1150
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:59,970
you know what I'm referring to

1151
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:01,680
martial arts which you took you took it

1152
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:06,260
to an extreme point you were very close

1153
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,260
to the black belt you gave that up but

1154
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:17,610
again I see only I see this relationship

1155
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:19,560
that you have with rich as ideal I know

1156
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:21,420
that you care about for him and I know

1157
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:26,160
that he cares about you I don't have any

1158
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:28,470
doubt of that and you have a good

1159
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,110
support system you have a good you know

1160
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:33,780
family support system a lot of it rich

1161
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:37,230
has a you know decent family support

1162
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:40,770
system and both of you are smart and

1163
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:42,690
both of you will accomplish whatever you

1164
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:46,440
want to accomplish to whatever degree

1165
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:50,690
you want to accomplish so I see success

1166
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:54,470
I see grandchildren I hope I see

1167
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:54,470
happiness all the time
