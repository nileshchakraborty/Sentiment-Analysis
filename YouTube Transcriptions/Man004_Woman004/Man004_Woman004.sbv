0:00:01.760,0:00:07.609
now you just lost because it was also

0:00:04.440,0:00:07.609
whoever laughs first

0:01:22.920,0:01:31.920
I'll be at 30 yeah oh okay oh so you're

0:01:28.210,0:01:34.869
gonna like give us a cue or something oh

0:01:31.920,0:01:37.780
okay well you gotta go first I had no

0:01:34.869,0:01:39.819
problem with the staring but being quiet

0:01:37.780,0:01:48.159
for 30 seconds is an accomplishment

0:01:39.819,0:01:59.049
I just what's your favorite childhood

0:01:48.159,0:02:02.110
memory and why probably to like more

0:01:59.049,0:02:04.689
generally speaking just being together

0:02:02.110,0:02:07.119
as a family and like family road trips

0:02:04.689,0:02:09.789
thank you and mom really instilled bad

0:02:07.119,0:02:13.810
and us that you should be adventurous

0:02:09.789,0:02:19.450
and like piling into mom's minivan and

0:02:13.810,0:02:22.349
driving to Florida and going out to

0:02:19.450,0:02:26.350
California when Laura came in and just

0:02:22.349,0:02:28.180
like feeling really safe and free

0:02:26.350,0:02:30.100
I feel like generally like any time with

0:02:28.180,0:02:32.200
family it's just like a good memory for

0:02:30.100,0:02:35.109
me because it was important to you guys

0:02:32.200,0:02:37.690
and like it shaped me but I would say my

0:02:35.109,0:02:40.000
first memory that is that I can like

0:02:37.690,0:02:41.609
remember having as a little kid

0:02:40.000,0:02:45.540
and I'm only saying this because it

0:02:41.609,0:02:50.350
involves you is I remember being really

0:02:45.540,0:02:52.180
sick one night like super sick and

0:02:50.350,0:02:55.260
having a fever I don't know how old I

0:02:52.180,0:02:59.980
was but you like took me out of bed and

0:02:55.260,0:03:03.130
held me in your room like buying a big

0:02:59.980,0:03:05.230
dresser that you have and like just kept

0:03:03.130,0:03:07.750
rocking me back and forth and like

0:03:05.230,0:03:09.940
petting my head and I like I remember

0:03:07.750,0:03:11.829
that like I remember feeling really safe

0:03:09.940,0:03:18.250
it's my first memory and like probably

0:03:11.829,0:03:20.169
my it's like safe place memory well that

0:03:18.250,0:03:22.870
that's that's a good memory to have I'm

0:03:20.169,0:03:25.510
not sure I wouldn't think you could go

0:03:22.870,0:03:29.680
back quite that far but and I'm not sure

0:03:25.510,0:03:31.810
how far it is but that process that you

0:03:29.680,0:03:35.140
described happens from

0:03:31.810,0:03:37.239
when you were not necessarily you didn't

0:03:35.140,0:03:41.470
have to be sick for me to hold you close

0:03:37.239,0:03:43.959
that way yeah and I just just love you

0:03:41.470,0:03:45.370
but I remember like being really sick

0:03:43.959,0:03:48.160
and you're doing it I'm sure it happened

0:03:45.370,0:03:50.050
more times than that oh that's that's a

0:03:48.160,0:03:50.410
that's a certainly a pleasant memory for

0:03:50.050,0:03:56.380
me

0:03:50.410,0:03:58.390
I miss it hard to hold me now all right

0:03:56.380,0:04:02.610
right away if we get to the next

0:03:58.390,0:04:07.690
question all of the adventures were

0:04:02.610,0:04:09.069
we're not that easy for both of us she

0:04:07.690,0:04:10.959
doesn't talk about it but there were

0:04:09.069,0:04:16.780
occasions we went astray a little bit

0:04:10.959,0:04:21.030
and nothing serious the family

0:04:16.780,0:04:21.030
adventures who are fun indeed I'm sorry

0:04:21.930,0:04:26.830
when you when you think of the first

0:04:24.520,0:04:28.510
time we met what do you remember I guess

0:04:26.830,0:04:34.300
when you think of when I was born what's

0:04:28.510,0:04:36.940
here fuck yeah yes I still see you as an

0:04:34.300,0:04:43.930
infant as soon as you were born I was

0:04:36.940,0:04:48.220
there as as you know I have seven

0:04:43.930,0:04:49.990
children but before you my oldest four I

0:04:48.220,0:04:52.360
never saw being born

0:04:49.990,0:04:55.300
it just wasn't permitted then and

0:04:52.360,0:04:58.060
starting with Nick and then you and

0:04:55.300,0:05:02.710
Julie I did was in the room where the

0:04:58.060,0:05:07.120
birth took place so clearly that blessed

0:05:02.710,0:05:09.340
that first time I met you and some

0:05:07.120,0:05:11.889
babies but you know newborn babies it's

0:05:09.340,0:05:13.330
not their finest moment but you were

0:05:11.889,0:05:18.030
beautiful from the day that you were

0:05:13.330,0:05:20.530
born and I still could see your face

0:05:18.030,0:05:22.539
I've forgotten a lot of other things but

0:05:20.530,0:05:27.580
I still seated your face the day that

0:05:22.539,0:05:30.880
you were born it was it was a wonderful

0:05:27.580,0:05:33.720
occasion every child's birth is a

0:05:30.880,0:05:33.720
wonderful occasion

0:05:34.470,0:05:40.990
you were youth wishing your mom's first

0:05:37.510,0:05:42.550
child and that was special to her and

0:05:40.990,0:05:45.069
certainly was special to me

0:05:42.550,0:05:49.210
and hasn't changed you are still and

0:05:45.069,0:05:50.500
always will be special okay I don't have

0:05:49.210,0:05:53.740
anything to say about the first time we

0:05:50.500,0:06:08.289
went no mic yeah we just go back and

0:05:53.740,0:06:09.849
forth okay is sort of like the other one

0:06:08.289,0:06:16.360
but it's what's the most fun you've had

0:06:09.849,0:06:21.669
with me and why we went to Cedar Point

0:06:16.360,0:06:24.400
in Ohio with John Andrew and because you

0:06:21.669,0:06:26.050
were like a little kid I mean you were

0:06:24.400,0:06:29.280
like running around here on every roller

0:06:26.050,0:06:34.210
coaster you were like you were just

0:06:29.280,0:06:36.819
really happy and like just such a free

0:06:34.210,0:06:43.860
spirit and it was just a fun trip but

0:06:36.819,0:06:46.930
that's like that's my probably I

0:06:43.860,0:06:51.360
certainly remember that likewise it was

0:06:46.930,0:06:53.710
a fun experience besides you and Julie

0:06:51.360,0:06:57.520
your brother Nick was there your brother

0:06:53.710,0:07:04.300
John was there and then several of your

0:06:57.520,0:07:08.169
nieces and nephews and I just read you

0:07:04.300,0:07:11.380
say I was energetic and participating in

0:07:08.169,0:07:15.190
everything but what I also remember from

0:07:11.380,0:07:18.250
that trip I'm not sure I could do it

0:07:15.190,0:07:26.469
anymore but in those days I was able to

0:07:18.250,0:07:28.539
trick the like 50-something well like 20

0:07:26.469,0:07:30.849
years off or something like that oh they

0:07:28.539,0:07:34.210
were 20 years old yeah I remember

0:07:30.849,0:07:35.889
yeah whatever age I actually was we

0:07:34.210,0:07:38.280
could sort of figure it out it's

0:07:35.889,0:07:45.849
probably about maybe 15 years ago

0:07:38.280,0:07:48.340
no no quick 10 well anyway anyway they I

0:07:45.849,0:07:50.919
remember what age they guessed that

0:07:48.340,0:07:53.229
guessed 48 which may not seem like

0:07:50.919,0:07:53.840
that's doing anybody any favors but I

0:07:53.229,0:07:56.120
was told

0:07:53.840,0:07:59.780
years beyond that 58 so yeah that's

0:07:56.120,0:08:05.120
about what it was yeah so it was a fun

0:07:59.780,0:08:08.750
fun time yes I remember it well is your

0:08:05.120,0:08:10.880
turn all right I'm gonna just never know

0:08:08.750,0:08:15.949
if you're getting this but please edit

0:08:10.880,0:08:19.330
that out okay okay what do you think is

0:08:15.949,0:08:19.330
special about our relationship

0:08:25.849,0:08:38.329
I think the one word that would describe

0:08:30.619,0:08:40.219
but the most is respect we have plenty

0:08:38.329,0:08:42.800
of differences differences in just

0:08:40.219,0:08:45.440
opinions not that many of those and

0:08:42.800,0:08:47.750
sometimes differences or you know other

0:08:45.440,0:08:50.360
things certainly doing the planning of

0:08:47.750,0:08:53.269
your wedding we've had a few but mostly

0:08:50.360,0:08:56.389
I have like whatever you want to do you

0:08:53.269,0:08:58.670
know it stands almost exclusive had I've

0:08:56.389,0:09:04.819
done that and you're gonna have a

0:08:58.670,0:09:09.380
wonderful wedding but I of course I

0:09:04.819,0:09:14.779
respect you but I I believe in you okay

0:09:09.380,0:09:20.120
and with your six siblings blessed would

0:09:14.779,0:09:21.709
every one of them and said for them if

0:09:20.120,0:09:25.839
not all of them in their own way have

0:09:21.709,0:09:29.199
excelled you from the day that you

0:09:25.839,0:09:32.269
started interacting with other people

0:09:29.199,0:09:34.399
on children and adults which would have

0:09:32.269,0:09:36.980
been it wasn't the first time if that

0:09:34.399,0:09:40.490
happened but when you were at the child

0:09:36.980,0:09:42.860
care center the one that was associated

0:09:40.490,0:09:46.060
with the church and she spent a lot of

0:09:42.860,0:09:51.889
time in there's a very well-run center

0:09:46.060,0:09:56.120
but from that time till as recently as

0:09:51.889,0:10:01.660
when Anna when you visited with with

0:09:56.120,0:10:08.350
Anna and she her you know sent back

0:10:01.660,0:10:11.449
accolades commendations anytime anyone

0:10:08.350,0:10:14.660
interacts with you even for just a

0:10:11.449,0:10:16.670
little teeny bit they always come away

0:10:14.660,0:10:18.019
not just with her she's nice or

0:10:16.670,0:10:21.500
something like that but they come away

0:10:18.019,0:10:26.079
if it gets back to familiar to your mom

0:10:21.500,0:10:29.810
and oftentimes it does with superlatives

0:10:26.079,0:10:32.720
so you have always engendered that kind

0:10:29.810,0:10:35.769
of reaction in people it's something I

0:10:32.720,0:10:37.520
admire about you you have always

0:10:35.769,0:10:42.110
excelled

0:10:37.520,0:10:46.670
going back to the days mrs. niches class

0:10:42.110,0:10:50.920
where you were doing the presentations

0:10:46.670,0:10:55.490
and we would go over them together but

0:10:50.920,0:11:01.430
you never had a second problem in any of

0:10:55.490,0:11:03.920
your schoolwork or academics and through

0:11:01.430,0:11:07.870
college if there was any problem and

0:11:03.920,0:11:12.910
perhaps still now it's that you are so

0:11:07.870,0:11:15.460
concerned with perfection that sometimes

0:11:12.910,0:11:19.280
oftentimes it becomes stressful for you

0:11:15.460,0:11:22.580
but you have done nothing for your 30

0:11:19.280,0:11:24.770
years but distinguish yourself and I

0:11:22.580,0:11:27.650
have no doubt that whatever you do

0:11:24.770,0:11:32.570
whatever you attempt to do your getting

0:11:27.650,0:11:35.350
involved in the business now I have no

0:11:32.570,0:11:42.980
doubt that you will be successful and

0:11:35.350,0:11:48.260
always be as poised and personable and

0:11:42.980,0:11:51.260
nice as you are now do that in its

0:11:48.260,0:11:53.690
entirety like you're giving wedding

0:11:51.260,0:11:56.090
speeches okay talking to me nothing I

0:11:53.690,0:11:59.750
know I know they could always get it in

0:11:56.090,0:12:01.310
there I agree about but the respects all

0:11:59.750,0:12:04.370
right I feel like you think that I call

0:12:01.310,0:12:08.420
mom more than I call you but I I call

0:12:04.370,0:12:10.460
you just as much and I call you when I

0:12:08.420,0:12:12.860
like really need it like when I need

0:12:10.460,0:12:16.250
advice because I trust your opinion and

0:12:12.860,0:12:18.110
I value it and sometimes I call mom just

0:12:16.250,0:12:20.270
to kind of like I'm walking from one

0:12:18.110,0:12:21.770
spot to another so you know just

0:12:20.270,0:12:27.740
shooting a shit and I do that with you

0:12:21.770,0:12:29.990
too but it's differently when I call you

0:12:27.740,0:12:32.870
get really excited and then you like you

0:12:29.990,0:12:34.520
know if I have a problem or anything I

0:12:32.870,0:12:36.290
know that you're not treating me like a

0:12:34.520,0:12:38.360
little kid anymore like you're coming at

0:12:36.290,0:12:41.790
it from an adult perspective and you

0:12:38.360,0:12:45.150
treat me like an equal usually

0:12:41.790,0:12:49.200
and mom comes at it in a different way

0:12:45.150,0:12:51.180
both are good but I just I value that

0:12:49.200,0:12:53.250
relationship that it's more of a respect

0:12:51.180,0:12:57.150
rather than mom still sometimes sees me

0:12:53.250,0:12:59.930
as like a little kid or or like her

0:12:57.150,0:13:03.690
friend and I don't think that were I

0:12:59.930,0:13:05.670
don't know that we're we're friends but

0:13:03.690,0:13:08.790
in a different way it's almost like

0:13:05.670,0:13:11.100
we're equals and you just you have a lot

0:13:08.790,0:13:13.020
more respect I think and you show it

0:13:11.100,0:13:13.380
differently than mom does if that makes

0:13:13.020,0:13:16.260
sense

0:13:13.380,0:13:20.460
well thank you for that I have

0:13:16.260,0:13:22.740
absolutely no jealousy when there's

0:13:20.460,0:13:24.660
interaction between you and Julie and

0:13:22.740,0:13:30.330
your mom or even some of your other

0:13:24.660,0:13:33.600
siblings first of all she what raised

0:13:30.330,0:13:36.000
you single-handedly my job had me out of

0:13:33.600,0:13:38.010
town all the time it's not that I wasn't

0:13:36.000,0:13:42.890
a good father I think I was but I was

0:13:38.010,0:13:46.620
away a lot and one of the things that's

0:13:42.890,0:13:48.840
most pleasing to me now is the really

0:13:46.620,0:13:54.030
excellent relationship that you and

0:13:48.840,0:13:55.980
Julie have with your mom and sure we

0:13:54.030,0:13:58.380
talk when it's necessary we talk just

0:13:55.980,0:14:00.180
when we feel like talking and I know

0:13:58.380,0:14:02.370
you're in touch with your mom every you

0:14:00.180,0:14:05.790
know all the time and that's exactly as

0:14:02.370,0:14:07.410
it should be so I would hope that you

0:14:05.790,0:14:09.330
keep that up when you don't call

0:14:07.410,0:14:12.090
sometimes you're away or something

0:14:09.330,0:14:14.480
I mean I'll shrug my shoulders but she

0:14:12.090,0:14:14.480
misses it

0:14:20.760,0:14:25.710
what was the hardest thing for you about

0:14:23.080,0:14:25.710
being a father

0:14:27.780,0:14:38.920
well I had a lot of hardships as a

0:14:33.010,0:14:43.740
father not so much with you with Julie

0:14:38.920,0:14:48.070
but with your older siblings and

0:14:43.740,0:14:52.900
certainly going back to your four oldest

0:14:48.070,0:14:54.900
siblings who had the same mother and and

0:14:52.900,0:14:58.980
that was a terrible terrible

0:14:54.900,0:15:05.260
relationship that I had with her and

0:14:58.980,0:15:07.270
coming from a broken home myself and my

0:15:05.260,0:15:09.930
kids saying retrospectively it was a

0:15:07.270,0:15:13.360
mistake but long after that marriage was

0:15:09.930,0:15:15.400
completely gone I stayed because I

0:15:13.360,0:15:20.170
thought that was best for your four

0:15:15.400,0:15:25.090
older siblings I don't have any regrets

0:15:20.170,0:15:26.470
about that okay I don't avoid people who

0:15:25.090,0:15:29.710
aren't getting along should not be

0:15:26.470,0:15:32.110
together but they need to also make take

0:15:29.710,0:15:36.250
serious consideration of children if

0:15:32.110,0:15:40.410
they have them so parenting your four

0:15:36.250,0:15:43.000
older siblings under those circumstances

0:15:40.410,0:15:45.310
were as you can imagine extremely

0:15:43.000,0:15:48.430
difficult I tried to be a good father

0:15:45.310,0:15:51.790
and I think I was I think if if you

0:15:48.430,0:15:54.880
would talk to your older siblings which

0:15:51.790,0:15:57.700
I know you do they don't they don't hold

0:15:54.880,0:16:00.520
anything against me so it's not so much

0:15:57.700,0:16:02.560
that but the question was what was you

0:16:00.520,0:16:06.520
know most difficult and it would have

0:16:02.560,0:16:10.290
been those times I didn't have really

0:16:06.520,0:16:14.770
very much difficulty with you and Julie

0:16:10.290,0:16:19.870
Julie was did her academics on her own

0:16:14.770,0:16:21.670
terms but certainly neither one of you

0:16:19.870,0:16:25.590
from that from the day you were born

0:16:21.670,0:16:30.480
caused either your mother or me

0:16:25.590,0:16:32.820
any any aggravation or anything no it's

0:16:30.480,0:16:35.700
true it's really true doesn't mean that

0:16:32.820,0:16:39.570
you always did exactly what you're

0:16:35.700,0:16:43.670
totally right but lucky saying thank the

0:16:39.570,0:16:46.050
older kids broke you in mm yeah no I

0:16:43.670,0:16:51.360
knew then and I know now and I know

0:16:46.050,0:16:53.250
retrospectively what a all children are

0:16:51.360,0:16:55.770
good unless they are made to be

0:16:53.250,0:16:57.330
otherwise but some whether it's

0:16:55.770,0:17:01.980
hereditary your upbringing or

0:16:57.330,0:17:03.870
environment or what have you or less

0:17:01.980,0:17:12.690
troublesome let's just saying in others

0:17:03.870,0:17:16.920
in our new engineer you just learn I

0:17:12.690,0:17:18.390
mean there weren't any problems yeah and

0:17:16.920,0:17:21.000
I can't say that but it what have you

0:17:18.390,0:17:25.500
all do she thinks it knit yes but the

0:17:21.000,0:17:28.380
other four they're all they're all fine

0:17:25.500,0:17:31.410
now so that's that's that's the good

0:17:28.380,0:17:33.110
news it's my turn yeah I'm taking from

0:17:31.410,0:17:36.600
here right yep

0:17:33.110,0:17:40.230
all right what's the most ridiculous

0:17:36.600,0:17:44.340
thing I've done what did it teach you

0:17:40.230,0:17:57.630
about me so you're gonna tell me if

0:17:44.340,0:17:59.040
that's our choice I think we used to

0:17:57.630,0:18:00.660
have family barbecues and you would

0:17:59.040,0:18:10.770
break those bricks at their head it was

0:18:00.660,0:18:12.630
just the most ridiculous but I think at

0:18:10.770,0:18:19.380
the time I remember being horribly

0:18:12.630,0:18:21.900
embarrassed and I'm scared for you but

0:18:19.380,0:18:24.720
now looking back I appreciate it

0:18:21.900,0:18:27.390
because you just didn't care you just

0:18:24.720,0:18:30.390
you had this like thing that you needed

0:18:27.390,0:18:32.790
to prove that you at least looking back

0:18:30.390,0:18:34.370
I take it that you were strong enough to

0:18:32.790,0:18:37.100
still do this and

0:18:34.370,0:18:38.630
you were you could and it was a pretty

0:18:37.100,0:18:41.960
cool parlor check anyway

0:18:38.630,0:18:46.640
but I appreciate that about you because

0:18:41.960,0:18:47.930
you've done it you did it when when you

0:18:46.640,0:18:49.700
found out that you were sick and you

0:18:47.930,0:18:51.830
still went to China and you went up the

0:18:49.700,0:18:53.450
Great Wall and you had to climb it and I

0:18:51.830,0:18:56.390
remember fighting with you about it

0:18:53.450,0:18:58.640
before when we were in Zion National

0:18:56.390,0:18:59.990
Park and being so angry with you but I

0:18:58.640,0:19:02.690
guess don't like stems from the same

0:18:59.990,0:19:04.790
thing that you like need to show people

0:19:02.690,0:19:07.070
that you can do it and I have that in me

0:19:04.790,0:19:08.630
so I guess like me that's part of the

0:19:07.070,0:19:12.700
reason that it pisses me off and you do

0:19:08.630,0:19:14.690
it but when I like look back at it I

0:19:12.700,0:19:18.320
appreciate that like in those moments

0:19:14.690,0:19:20.000
you don't that like you're just you need

0:19:18.320,0:19:23.150
to prove it to yourself in to everyone

0:19:20.000,0:19:25.550
else and you don't just kind of sit

0:19:23.150,0:19:27.380
still and say like the doctor told me

0:19:25.550,0:19:29.390
that this isn't gonna happen so it just

0:19:27.380,0:19:31.850
won't still think it wasn't the best

0:19:29.390,0:19:34.840
idea but I kind of appreciate that you

0:19:31.850,0:19:39.470
think you're a cowboy sometimes well

0:19:34.840,0:19:41.900
more often than not if I did that

0:19:39.470,0:19:55.250
whatever the setting it was because

0:19:41.900,0:19:56.990
somebody asked me to do it okay it

0:19:55.250,0:19:59.600
wasn't the little kids that the food

0:19:56.990,0:20:00.950
asked we was doing with me no but it was

0:19:59.600,0:20:05.210
the adults and I didn't know I was

0:20:00.950,0:20:08.090
embarrassing anybody but you know I

0:20:05.210,0:20:09.920
would also admit that every now and then

0:20:08.090,0:20:12.710
whatever the occasion it wasn't just at

0:20:09.920,0:20:15.250
our barbecues like if I felt that this

0:20:12.710,0:20:17.690
was that I wanted to show off I would

0:20:15.250,0:20:20.090
want to chase me to break a brick or

0:20:17.690,0:20:23.059
something like that so I would be

0:20:20.090,0:20:25.520
responding to somebody who is looking

0:20:23.059,0:20:26.960
back now the fact that you're like 60

0:20:25.520,0:20:28.790
something-year-old father could smash a

0:20:26.960,0:20:31.820
brick with his head is what kind of a

0:20:28.790,0:20:35.179
kind of cool like I can say that I think

0:20:31.820,0:20:36.920
I probably could still do it I was it's

0:20:35.179,0:20:41.630
hard to find a brick around the house

0:20:36.920,0:20:45.530
that he wore your mom hides him but yeah

0:20:41.630,0:20:47.390
I mean if somebody asked me now I would

0:20:45.530,0:20:49.980
still do it

0:20:47.390,0:20:51.600
and when the time comes that I can't

0:20:49.980,0:20:55.590
anymore which is probably not that far

0:20:51.600,0:21:00.870
often so--but please know brick-breaking

0:20:55.590,0:21:09.290
I have to blow my nose get you'll be

0:21:00.870,0:21:12.930
able to edit that I'm sorry about that

0:21:09.290,0:21:17.250
it is allergy something triggering my

0:21:12.930,0:21:23.280
own okay okay what's the greatest lesson

0:21:17.250,0:21:28.880
I taught you and that's it that's a good

0:21:23.280,0:21:34.080
question the egg teaching the chicken or

0:21:28.880,0:21:39.420
the grasshopper teaching the what I've

0:21:34.080,0:21:45.360
learned from you is patience and poise

0:21:39.420,0:21:50.040
and at times I have that and sometimes

0:21:45.360,0:21:53.760
if I'm angry I may disguise it

0:21:50.040,0:21:56.790
deliberately or not not have it you

0:21:53.760,0:21:59.910
don't lose your you you do get stressed

0:21:56.790,0:22:02.190
and I mentioned that earlier because you

0:21:59.910,0:22:04.590
expect so much of yourself and you

0:22:02.190,0:22:07.020
expect such a level of organization that

0:22:04.590,0:22:10.380
when it's not happening you can become

0:22:07.020,0:22:14.480
stressed but you're always poised you're

0:22:10.380,0:22:18.300
always in control of yourself

0:22:14.480,0:22:20.010
you're always respectful of others now I

0:22:18.300,0:22:22.530
wouldn't say that you've taught me that

0:22:20.010,0:22:25.140
that's something I tried to instill in

0:22:22.530,0:22:28.410
all my children but then seeing that

0:22:25.140,0:22:33.480
reflected in you it makes me very very

0:22:28.410,0:22:39.560
proud so in my mind you're all but a

0:22:33.480,0:22:39.560
human a perfect human being in my mind

0:22:40.220,0:22:45.420
to a large degree I think that that's

0:22:42.870,0:22:48.300
more than in my mind but that's still in

0:22:45.420,0:22:51.630
the ibises of the b-and-b o beholder and

0:22:48.300,0:22:56.700
clearly there's some prejudice on my

0:22:51.630,0:22:59.210
part but you know you are for anybody

0:22:56.700,0:23:01.470
and myself included

0:22:59.210,0:23:04.380
I'm going to use a word that you

0:23:01.470,0:23:10.020
probably expected to be used anyway you

0:23:04.380,0:23:13.610
are the quintessential example of a just

0:23:10.020,0:23:13.610
a really good decent person

0:23:21.380,0:23:26.809
what are you hesitant to tell me now

0:23:24.300,0:23:26.809
that's a good one

0:23:34.500,0:23:44.090
I don't think there's anything I like

0:23:40.380,0:23:44.090
I'm pretty open and honest with you

0:23:50.749,0:23:59.989
anything that I haven't already told you

0:23:53.669,0:24:03.570
I think going into the wedding I was

0:23:59.989,0:24:07.950
hesitant to tell you how strongly I

0:24:03.570,0:24:10.950
didn't want to do it but I think at this

0:24:07.950,0:24:13.200
point that's already come and I think

0:24:10.950,0:24:15.629
I'm past that part and I'm excited I'm

0:24:13.200,0:24:20.340
happy for it but generally speaking I

0:24:15.629,0:24:22.259
feel like you know I don't certainly

0:24:20.340,0:24:25.049
feel that you withhold much from me so

0:24:22.259,0:24:33.539
that that comports with you know what I

0:24:25.049,0:24:34.559
perceive how am I most like you and how

0:24:33.539,0:24:43.470
does that scare you

0:24:34.559,0:24:46.049
oh well you have a lot of your mom in

0:24:43.470,0:24:52.679
you but you certainly have plenty of me

0:24:46.049,0:24:56.249
I think maybe the thing that I'd be most

0:24:52.679,0:24:59.639
concerned of a characteristic which I

0:24:56.249,0:25:02.070
know that we share is sensitivity yeah

0:24:59.639,0:25:05.879
and that's why sometimes when we are

0:25:02.070,0:25:13.019
talking we'll say something you to me or

0:25:05.879,0:25:15.239
I to you and it will disturb or hurt

0:25:13.019,0:25:22.440
even the other person the other party

0:25:15.239,0:25:24.450
and we probably you know oftentimes what

0:25:22.440,0:25:28.289
happens is we'll say something you could

0:25:24.450,0:25:30.419
text something and then realize you know

0:25:28.289,0:25:33.229
this was hurtful when I want to send

0:25:30.419,0:25:37.049
back and either explain it or apologize

0:25:33.229,0:25:40.590
but should either one of us be as

0:25:37.049,0:25:42.869
sensitive as we are I don't think either

0:25:40.590,0:25:46.499
one of us could be anything else but

0:25:42.869,0:25:49.830
that is I don't know that I've past

0:25:46.499,0:25:51.149
doing any traits to you not if you've

0:25:49.830,0:25:53.759
had all of them you'd have putti

0:25:51.149,0:25:55.710
negative traits but I don't perceive

0:25:53.759,0:25:56.500
that I've passed on any traits to you

0:25:55.710,0:25:59.380
that are

0:25:56.500,0:26:02.200
you know really negative or detrimental

0:25:59.380,0:26:06.240
to your your living your life that one

0:26:02.200,0:26:11.170
though I think is is an obvious to me I

0:26:06.240,0:26:11.890
think I have another one and it's only

0:26:11.170,0:26:15.640
with you

0:26:11.890,0:26:18.910
good stubbornness like anime beauty

0:26:15.640,0:26:21.100
comes from the sensitivity thing but you

0:26:18.910,0:26:23.320
like sometimes approach things as if

0:26:21.100,0:26:25.060
you're still negotiating like you're

0:26:23.320,0:26:27.670
still debating everything and it's a

0:26:25.060,0:26:31.210
battle and I get to a point where I just

0:26:27.670,0:26:33.730
I I want you to see my side of it and

0:26:31.210,0:26:36.370
you won't back down and oh it's so

0:26:33.730,0:26:37.960
stubborn and that's from you cuz mom

0:26:36.370,0:26:43.630
doesn't have it mom will just kind of

0:26:37.960,0:26:46.420
feel like okay you think by generally

0:26:43.630,0:26:48.030
speaking I only do it with you well I'm

0:26:46.420,0:26:51.040
certainly I don't wouldn't call it

0:26:48.030,0:26:52.990
argumentative but if I'm if I feel that

0:26:51.040,0:26:55.150
I'm because argumentative just implies

0:26:52.990,0:26:56.860
you just you know you're all I could

0:26:55.150,0:27:01.450
about everything like that it's more

0:26:56.860,0:27:03.550
like as if you're I mean I never saw you

0:27:01.450,0:27:06.340
in action at work but I can imagine I

0:27:03.550,0:27:08.020
mean your job was to basically to meet

0:27:06.340,0:27:09.970
with people and have them see your side

0:27:08.020,0:27:12.970
and sometimes you translate that into

0:27:09.970,0:27:14.470
your day-to-day life and you certainly

0:27:12.970,0:27:16.870
do that with your family because I think

0:27:14.470,0:27:18.790
we're a bit more forgiving and then

0:27:16.870,0:27:23.530
everyone else seems to just be like okay

0:27:18.790,0:27:25.300
dad that's fine yeah I engaged felonies

0:27:23.530,0:27:27.490
probably shouldn't I don't know that it

0:27:25.300,0:27:29.830
relates to anything so much that I did

0:27:27.490,0:27:34.480
at work from when I was growing up I was

0:27:29.830,0:27:38.560
if I had an opinion I was pretty pretty

0:27:34.480,0:27:41.650
much willing to stand by it go back a

0:27:38.560,0:27:44.050
far enough and then I grew up in a rough

0:27:41.650,0:27:46.570
neighborhood sometimes that would be did

0:27:44.050,0:27:50.100
the supporting my opinion might involved

0:27:46.570,0:27:53.860
you know a little physical interaction

0:27:50.100,0:27:56.110
but not more often and even as I was

0:27:53.860,0:27:59.230
going through school when I had an

0:27:56.110,0:28:02.740
opinion I would pretty much try to

0:27:59.230,0:28:06.640
defend it but others may not see me that

0:28:02.740,0:28:08.900
way and you may not but I see myself as

0:28:06.640,0:28:15.690
first of all

0:28:08.900,0:28:17.130
almost completely logical so that some

0:28:15.690,0:28:20.460
things have nothing to do with logic

0:28:17.130,0:28:23.820
just what you think but if somebody

0:28:20.460,0:28:25.710
proves me wrong I do back wolf now like

0:28:23.820,0:28:29.850
I do recall I don't know if it was you

0:28:25.710,0:28:31.890
or Julie I did one of one of you your

0:28:29.850,0:28:35.790
brothers and sisters and it might have

0:28:31.890,0:28:39.900
been several of you would say to me we

0:28:35.790,0:28:41.640
would get into a discussion because I

0:28:39.900,0:28:43.440
would say to all of you if you want to

0:28:41.640,0:28:45.690
do something or not do something you

0:28:43.440,0:28:47.760
know make your case yeah your mom would

0:28:45.690,0:28:49.830
just say no you can't do it sometimes

0:28:47.760,0:28:51.180
you know I would say no let's listen

0:28:49.830,0:28:58.530
right in those cases you're very

0:28:51.180,0:29:00.780
rational but every now and then in it's

0:28:58.530,0:29:02.130
not necessarily that setting but one of

0:29:00.780,0:29:04.290
you would say to me well you're not

0:29:02.130,0:29:09.360
being feared dad quote you lose your

0:29:04.290,0:29:11.790
using logic well I mean other than you

0:29:09.360,0:29:15.300
that said it but if it happened a few

0:29:11.790,0:29:20.340
times over your mom never said that she

0:29:15.300,0:29:23.640
probably thinks it my turn yeah I like

0:29:20.340,0:29:26.240
this game nut game I mean whatever it is

0:29:23.640,0:29:26.240
thank you

0:29:30.899,0:29:35.799
when or what was the toughest

0:29:33.580,0:29:41.110
relationship that took toughest moment

0:29:35.799,0:29:48.610
in your relationship in air it is air

0:29:41.110,0:29:51.159
yes thank you I think when I was leaving

0:29:48.610,0:29:54.039
for South America

0:29:51.159,0:29:56.890
you were just so deceivingly so

0:29:54.039,0:29:59.080
disappointed and the fact that I was

0:29:56.890,0:30:03.100
like had been going on this trajectory

0:29:59.080,0:30:05.799
that was so by-the-book and I had this

0:30:03.100,0:30:09.610
relationship and I had a good job

0:30:05.799,0:30:12.490
and I didn't really console with you or

0:30:09.610,0:30:15.220
mom I just did it for the most part it

0:30:12.490,0:30:16.809
was kind of like I'm booking this ticket

0:30:15.220,0:30:18.490
it was more of a courtesy call rather

0:30:16.809,0:30:20.950
than a discussion and I think I had

0:30:18.490,0:30:22.450
never really done that before and I

0:30:20.950,0:30:26.110
think I was probably scaring you a

0:30:22.450,0:30:29.769
little bit that I did it um we didn't

0:30:26.110,0:30:31.990
talk very much when I went you know come

0:30:29.769,0:30:33.940
with me to the airport and like even the

0:30:31.990,0:30:35.320
day before you were asking me if like I

0:30:33.940,0:30:37.000
would stay and I was like I already

0:30:35.320,0:30:40.210
booked a ticket and you said I'll pay

0:30:37.000,0:30:43.389
for you to not go and part of it I think

0:30:40.210,0:30:45.760
was ingest but I think you were not

0:30:43.389,0:30:48.480
happy with the decision that I made and

0:30:45.760,0:30:51.940
you didn't do a very good job of

0:30:48.480,0:30:54.159
covering that up which is fine but I the

0:30:51.940,0:30:56.409
feeling of disappointing you I think was

0:30:54.159,0:30:59.590
the hardest part well I think you

0:30:56.409,0:31:01.870
misinterpreted that it's not that I had

0:30:59.590,0:31:04.269
I mean you had a good job at the time I

0:31:01.870,0:31:05.529
had a good how you were fortunate enough

0:31:04.269,0:31:08.070
to have a good job right out of college

0:31:05.529,0:31:11.409
and you just gave that up

0:31:08.070,0:31:14.649
that was not my main concern because I I

0:31:11.409,0:31:18.220
knew that you could get any job you're

0:31:14.649,0:31:20.980
worried I mean as far as like being

0:31:18.220,0:31:22.389
supportive you weren't and I never had

0:31:20.980,0:31:25.419
you not be supportive you're usually

0:31:22.389,0:31:27.519
kind of like my biggest cheerleader and

0:31:25.419,0:31:31.149
you weren't in that moment and you

0:31:27.519,0:31:33.820
probably didn't realize it but it was

0:31:31.149,0:31:35.320
that was tough and I wasn't I didn't

0:31:33.820,0:31:36.789
want to have to convince you otherwise

0:31:35.320,0:31:39.220
because I understood where you were

0:31:36.789,0:31:41.679
coming from but I remember you saying

0:31:39.220,0:31:42.040
you know asking whether Sebastian and I

0:31:41.679,0:31:44.410
would say

0:31:42.040,0:31:46.540
together and I said I didn't know and if

0:31:44.410,0:31:48.250
we didn't then we weren't meant to be

0:31:46.540,0:31:50.410
together that this is something I had to

0:31:48.250,0:31:51.820
do and you didn't like that response and

0:31:50.410,0:31:55.600
you didn't like that he wasn't coming

0:31:51.820,0:31:57.490
and you were meant reminded me that beds

0:31:55.600,0:32:00.250
get cold when people are away I think of

0:31:57.490,0:32:02.800
what you said well and it ended up being

0:32:00.250,0:32:04.720
true I mean we weren't a good fit but

0:32:02.800,0:32:06.340
I'm gone I want had i not left i

0:32:04.720,0:32:08.890
wouldn't have realized that i wouldn't

0:32:06.340,0:32:10.420
be where I am now if I hadn't done it I

0:32:08.890,0:32:13.440
who knows where I would have been I

0:32:10.420,0:32:16.320
would have been happy well

0:32:13.440,0:32:18.970
retrospectively and I'm not sure I was

0:32:16.320,0:32:24.690
aware of all that you're saying now your

0:32:18.970,0:32:28.030
feelings but what I remember the most

0:32:24.690,0:32:31.120
wasn't so much a concern about how you

0:32:28.030,0:32:34.540
would you know get away with your career

0:32:31.120,0:32:36.820
I had complete faith in you with in that

0:32:34.540,0:32:41.470
respect I was concerned about your

0:32:36.820,0:32:46.480
well-being I was until the end and you

0:32:41.470,0:32:48.490
came back and again it's this is not

0:32:46.480,0:32:50.020
retrospective this actually happened

0:32:48.490,0:32:53.680
yeah I did raise a question about

0:32:50.020,0:32:56.500
whether relationship of I think it was

0:32:53.680,0:32:59.310
five years by that point you know

0:32:56.500,0:33:05.020
between two young people could survive

0:32:59.310,0:33:06.640
being away that wall so and and and as

0:33:05.020,0:33:08.650
you say now maybe that would have broken

0:33:06.640,0:33:12.370
up anyway but that actually did come to

0:33:08.650,0:33:14.740
pass 14 I currently needed to leave for

0:33:12.370,0:33:17.170
five months six months right now I have

0:33:14.740,0:33:18.940
no doubt that I would my relationship

0:33:17.170,0:33:19.570
would be fine I was with the wrong

0:33:18.940,0:33:23.560
person

0:33:19.570,0:33:26.020
neither do I okay that's them but but in

0:33:23.560,0:33:28.990
terms of Sebastian that's hindsight but

0:33:26.020,0:33:32.050
the other thing that in fact I did

0:33:28.990,0:33:34.590
predict was I was concerned for your

0:33:32.050,0:33:36.970
well-being in in two regards

0:33:34.590,0:33:39.550
unfortunately that came to pass you were

0:33:36.970,0:33:43.570
pretty seriously mom it's a fortunately

0:33:39.550,0:33:46.140
weren't injured but when you were in

0:33:43.570,0:33:47.830
Uruguay what do you require wouldn't it

0:33:46.140,0:33:51.370
okay Ecuador

0:33:47.830,0:33:54.190
and and then the other thing is that a

0:33:51.370,0:33:58.630
terrible terrible

0:33:54.190,0:34:04.120
I guess it was a fungus right yeah that

0:33:58.630,0:34:06.760
you had which was a major problem could

0:34:04.120,0:34:09.669
have actually cost your life in fact of

0:34:06.760,0:34:12.750
course I don't mean money-wise cost but

0:34:09.669,0:34:15.250
the major sin valve major surgery now

0:34:12.750,0:34:17.320
nobody necessarily could have predicted

0:34:15.250,0:34:19.090
that so I'm not saying you know what we

0:34:17.320,0:34:20.470
could walk out in the street right now I

0:34:19.090,0:34:22.240
got hit by a car

0:34:20.470,0:34:23.919
it was just like I've never felt more

0:34:22.240,0:34:26.850
sure about something in my life and when

0:34:23.919,0:34:29.590
I made that decision and you were so

0:34:26.850,0:34:32.139
against it and so obviously against it

0:34:29.590,0:34:34.720
and you're like use no filter it was

0:34:32.139,0:34:37.240
just it was tough you know you I want

0:34:34.720,0:34:39.010
you to be proud of me and I want you to

0:34:37.240,0:34:40.810
support things that I'm doing and that

0:34:39.010,0:34:42.760
was a moment when you didn't and I

0:34:40.810,0:34:44.500
understand I don't know how that would

0:34:42.760,0:34:47.500
feel and I understand where you're

0:34:44.500,0:34:49.210
coming from with all of it but as your

0:34:47.500,0:34:53.050
daughter as someone that had to like

0:34:49.210,0:34:57.910
hear some of that feedback a lot of it

0:34:53.050,0:35:00.460
being kind of cold was ah I'm very sorry

0:34:57.910,0:35:04.060
if that's either the way I was or the

0:35:00.460,0:35:06.160
way you perceived it I was very proud of

0:35:04.060,0:35:07.870
what you were doing and I would brag

0:35:06.160,0:35:10.500
about you all the time during that

0:35:07.870,0:35:13.510
six-month period and before and after

0:35:10.500,0:35:15.640
you know how you were you weren't

0:35:13.510,0:35:22.060
getting paid and you were really working

0:35:15.640,0:35:23.890
with negative native peoples and you you

0:35:22.060,0:35:26.260
know you were working for nonprofits and

0:35:23.890,0:35:30.460
you were you were not trying but you

0:35:26.260,0:35:32.710
didn't work helping people so I was very

0:35:30.460,0:35:39.790
proud of what you were doing I was also

0:35:32.710,0:35:48.330
proud that a young woman of weird 25 had

0:35:39.790,0:35:55.450
the was courageous enough to undertake a

0:35:48.330,0:35:57.880
venture like that in adventure and we

0:35:55.450,0:35:59.560
cool exactly being as negative as you

0:35:57.880,0:36:03.490
describe me but I'm not sounding that

0:35:59.560,0:36:06.100
that's where you perceive me but if so I

0:36:03.490,0:36:08.950
got over it very quickly I didn't

0:36:06.100,0:36:11.060
until you came back I didn't get over

0:36:08.950,0:36:15.860
you know being concerned for your

0:36:11.060,0:36:17.360
well-being but beyond that and of course

0:36:15.860,0:36:21.100
the thing with Sebastian that was

0:36:17.360,0:36:23.869
playing out as you were down there and

0:36:21.100,0:36:27.920
that that pretty obviously at this point

0:36:23.869,0:36:30.020
was meant to be but I was very proud of

0:36:27.920,0:36:34.880
you for what you did and I am I am now

0:36:30.020,0:36:43.720
I'm sorry if I didn't project that at

0:36:34.880,0:36:43.720
the proper time it's not to be Seavers

0:36:46.030,0:36:57.350
what did you learn from your parents

0:36:48.470,0:36:59.060
that you wish you could forget might be

0:36:57.350,0:37:00.890
a more appropriate question if I said

0:36:59.060,0:37:03.380
what what do you want to remember about

0:37:00.890,0:37:06.880
your parents and your upbringing now I

0:37:03.380,0:37:09.860
want to quickly qualify that my mother

0:37:06.880,0:37:15.290
who at a point in time was a single

0:37:09.860,0:37:17.420
mother of six at a time when women were

0:37:15.290,0:37:19.810
not very often in the workplace and

0:37:17.420,0:37:25.490
certainly not what six kids anyway and

0:37:19.810,0:37:29.810
my father would he wasn't totally out of

0:37:25.490,0:37:34.670
the picture but he he hardly supported

0:37:29.810,0:37:43.040
us and we didn't see him very often but

0:37:34.670,0:37:46.100
I mean we we were the fact that we were

0:37:43.040,0:37:47.030
as poor as we were I mean at least at a

0:37:46.100,0:37:50.780
time

0:37:47.030,0:37:53.660
I am my five siblings you know got

0:37:50.780,0:37:56.240
closer and because of that my mother was

0:37:53.660,0:37:58.060
a person that didn't have an evil bone

0:37:56.240,0:38:02.410
in her body not a mean bone

0:37:58.060,0:38:10.030
body my father let's finish what him was

0:38:02.410,0:38:13.840
not much of a father so I did learn from

0:38:10.030,0:38:17.260
him when I said earlier that I stayed

0:38:13.840,0:38:20.110
with a wife that really wasn't intended

0:38:17.260,0:38:22.210
that was more the course of going up

0:38:20.110,0:38:24.310
that way in that situation he abandoned

0:38:22.210,0:38:29.650
us so I wasn't going to do that to my

0:38:24.310,0:38:32.230
you know my kids my mother was nothing

0:38:29.650,0:38:34.710
if she wasn't the kindest most decent

0:38:32.230,0:38:39.130
person in the world but she had habits

0:38:34.710,0:38:41.170
that would just drive people crazy in

0:38:39.130,0:38:46.060
general and certainly drives me and my

0:38:41.170,0:38:50.250
brothers and sisters crazy I think we've

0:38:46.060,0:38:55.180
talked about some of them so I'll just

0:38:50.250,0:38:58.450
review one that to this day she had this

0:38:55.180,0:39:02.380
thing that if you drank water with your

0:38:58.450,0:39:05.920
food any meal anytime snack it was

0:39:02.380,0:39:08.740
unhealthy you should not be done so that

0:39:05.920,0:39:12.760
whatever food we have at any given time

0:39:08.740,0:39:19.480
we were permitted and then she would get

0:39:12.760,0:39:21.280
us tea kool-aid and any with just sugar

0:39:19.480,0:39:25.510
water and it's the worst thing for you

0:39:21.280,0:39:28.330
soda was certainly fine not water okay

0:39:25.510,0:39:30.250
until the day she died may she rest in

0:39:28.330,0:39:34.840
peace she never changed their mind on

0:39:30.250,0:39:37.690
that so you know growing up you don't

0:39:34.840,0:39:39.280
have to maybe when you're young enough

0:39:37.690,0:39:41.140
you just accept that your mother's

0:39:39.280,0:39:46.480
telling you they're at a point in time

0:39:41.140,0:39:49.620
something that's obviously so just

0:39:46.480,0:39:52.090
absolutely unacceptable

0:39:49.620,0:39:54.280
becomes a problematic when it keeps

0:39:52.090,0:39:57.010
coming back and back and back over and

0:39:54.280,0:39:59.650
over again so I'm just you know giving

0:39:57.010,0:40:02.400
one example I'm most most children

0:39:59.650,0:40:06.640
remember annoyances from their mothers

0:40:02.400,0:40:09.380
but I also remember is that without a

0:40:06.640,0:40:14.209
father she raised six of us

0:40:09.380,0:40:16.759
and I loved her dearly I'd miss her

0:40:14.209,0:40:19.459
I probably didn't always treat her as

0:40:16.759,0:40:23.180
well as I should have because of some of

0:40:19.459,0:40:24.979
these annoying things which would you

0:40:23.180,0:40:27.440
know as a young as a teenager and

0:40:24.979,0:40:34.420
preteen Andrew they're difficult to

0:40:27.440,0:40:34.420
accept so what was the question

0:40:37.509,0:40:43.579
yeah well I think I've given you a same

0:40:40.400,0:40:45.170
thing there's not I I think what it's

0:40:43.579,0:40:48.259
not a question of passing one if you're

0:40:45.170,0:40:50.059
talking about genes you you remind me

0:40:48.259,0:40:54.529
you're named after my mother and you

0:40:50.059,0:41:00.140
remind me of her you're a sweet and kind

0:40:54.529,0:41:05.599
in some sense you look like her new CD

0:41:00.140,0:41:09.549
teachers but some of those traits that

0:41:05.599,0:41:09.549
she had and certainly that my father had

0:41:09.969,0:41:14.289
we want to pay uh someone to anybody

0:41:21.480,0:41:28.300
what mistakes do you see me making that

0:41:25.180,0:41:31.020
you have also made what would you advise

0:41:28.300,0:41:31.020
me to do

0:41:49.670,0:41:55.819
um I think you're a little too hard on

0:41:53.660,0:41:59.270
yourself sometimes which you criticize

0:41:55.819,0:42:03.160
me for being we do it in different ways

0:41:59.270,0:42:06.650
but I think you're really worried that

0:42:03.160,0:42:10.280
your weren't good enough father or that

0:42:06.650,0:42:12.530
you made too many mistakes or that you

0:42:10.280,0:42:14.750
weren't around enough and then maybe

0:42:12.530,0:42:17.359
you'd be remembered like that and that's

0:42:14.750,0:42:18.950
just not the case and you're really hard

0:42:17.359,0:42:23.619
on yourself with that I think you should

0:42:18.950,0:42:27.260
cut yourself a break I think you're

0:42:23.619,0:42:31.760
pretty much ready to home with that I

0:42:27.260,0:42:34.309
also don't you know I'm not totally down

0:42:31.760,0:42:39.440
on myself I've used seven children

0:42:34.309,0:42:42.440
first of all with three different

0:42:39.440,0:42:45.339
mothers but the word half is never used

0:42:42.440,0:42:48.380
in our family and you're as close with

0:42:45.339,0:42:51.140
your half-sister lincei is you would be

0:42:48.380,0:42:53.720
with as you are with Julie who's your

0:42:51.140,0:42:56.630
full sister that's to your credit I'm

0:42:53.720,0:42:59.450
saying you like made us stay a family

0:42:56.630,0:43:01.359
and I don't know anyone else that could

0:42:59.450,0:43:04.339
say that or a few people I mean I know

0:43:01.359,0:43:08.299
siblings that are full that aren't as

0:43:04.339,0:43:12.559
close as we are and people make mistakes

0:43:08.299,0:43:14.000
you make any that are any other parent

0:43:12.559,0:43:16.099
wouldn't have made you're just you're

0:43:14.000,0:43:18.079
really hard on yourself about all of

0:43:16.099,0:43:25.400
that I don't think you should be well

0:43:18.079,0:43:27.170
I'm certainly not so so modest or hard

0:43:25.400,0:43:30.799
on myself that I wouldn't admit to that

0:43:27.170,0:43:34.420
and boast and brag about it even I do

0:43:30.799,0:43:37.760
feel that the closeness and the family

0:43:34.420,0:43:40.640
ties that the seven of you and

0:43:37.760,0:43:42.950
consequently my grandchildren your

0:43:40.640,0:43:46.369
nieces and nephews and and even the

0:43:42.950,0:43:49.849
great-grandchildren that's something

0:43:46.369,0:43:51.740
that was instilled in everybody and he's

0:43:49.849,0:43:52.839
pretty tough it dissipates it hasn't

0:43:51.740,0:43:55.190
happened yet

0:43:52.839,0:43:58.730
all of those people will be at your

0:43:55.190,0:43:59.170
wedding there's not a one of them you

0:43:58.730,0:44:01.510
know

0:43:59.170,0:44:03.220
I can't make it or this is that nobody

0:44:01.510,0:44:06.040
even thinks that they wouldn't be at

0:44:03.220,0:44:07.480
your wedding and and that's what kind of

0:44:06.040,0:44:08.740
family that you have and you wouldn't

0:44:07.480,0:44:15.069
think that you wouldn't be somebody

0:44:08.740,0:44:16.809
else's let's say serious you have said

0:44:15.069,0:44:21.190
in the past like regrets that you've had

0:44:16.809,0:44:24.730
about with raising any number of us and

0:44:21.190,0:44:26.950
I just I don't think you should have

0:44:24.730,0:44:29.440
them I mean you've said me we should

0:44:26.950,0:44:31.150
have been around more for Nick or you

0:44:29.440,0:44:33.849
shouldn't have been as hard on the older

0:44:31.150,0:44:36.520
for kids for any number of things and I

0:44:33.849,0:44:38.589
just you were a parent you were a young

0:44:36.520,0:44:42.970
parent and I just think that you made

0:44:38.589,0:44:45.369
mistakes as anyone would have but no one

0:44:42.970,0:44:49.450
sees you like that we all see you as a

0:44:45.369,0:44:51.369
really good father and we we recognize

0:44:49.450,0:44:54.099
the fact that we are so close as a

0:44:51.369,0:44:56.109
result of you telling us that family is

0:44:54.099,0:44:57.970
the most important and you should be

0:44:56.109,0:45:00.849
proud of that because we're proud of it

0:44:57.970,0:45:04.089
I am very proud of that I don't see

0:45:00.849,0:45:05.799
myself you know in a completely opposite

0:45:04.089,0:45:08.470
or negative if I don't see myself as a

0:45:05.799,0:45:11.230
terrible father I just have regrets that

0:45:08.470,0:45:12.730
as any or all of you we're growing up

0:45:11.230,0:45:18.490
that certain things could have been

0:45:12.730,0:45:20.770
right deal so it can't get that back I'm

0:45:18.490,0:45:24.790
certainly not I'm certainly pleased with

0:45:20.770,0:45:25.510
the products seven times over so that's

0:45:24.790,0:45:29.309
not the issue

0:45:25.510,0:45:32.220
oh you turned out to be yeah wonderful I

0:45:29.309,0:45:39.190
wouldn't change any one of you at all

0:45:32.220,0:45:42.970
maybe Goods girlfriend's boy I hope it

0:45:39.190,0:45:46.210
gets back to Glenn it's not anything I

0:45:42.970,0:45:52.329
haven't said to God but now other than

0:45:46.210,0:45:57.460
that I'm completely really completely

0:45:52.329,0:46:00.400
satisfied with the who all of you are so

0:45:57.460,0:46:02.049
in that regard I'm also not stupid I

0:46:00.400,0:46:04.750
have to take some credit for that

0:46:02.049,0:46:08.109
right but there are still plenty plenty

0:46:04.750,0:46:09.019
plenty regrets that I did do things or

0:46:08.109,0:46:10.269
didn't do things

0:46:09.019,0:46:26.419
you know could have done some things

0:46:10.269,0:46:39.549
differently yours or mine what quality

0:46:26.419,0:46:45.679
do you wish my fiance had but doesn't I

0:46:39.549,0:46:49.549
I know rich pretty well and if he has

0:46:45.679,0:46:53.119
qualities or doesn't have Galax

0:46:49.549,0:46:58.309
qualities that are important to him in

0:46:53.119,0:47:03.919
you in your life together I don't know

0:46:58.309,0:47:06.529
of them you know having said that there

0:47:03.919,0:47:08.419
is one courted turning around the

0:47:06.529,0:47:13.999
question but I've said this to you too

0:47:08.419,0:47:19.609
into him the one quality that he he does

0:47:13.999,0:47:22.639
have which perhaps at least your last

0:47:19.609,0:47:27.319
boyfriend didn't and consequently he

0:47:22.639,0:47:31.759
lost you okay now maybe that was meant

0:47:27.319,0:47:33.949
to be you know but he still hasn't

0:47:31.759,0:47:38.689
gotten over that you know it was too

0:47:33.949,0:47:40.880
late well okay and by the way as you

0:47:38.689,0:47:43.819
well know I did not I don't have

0:47:40.880,0:47:46.189
anything against Sebastian so it's it's

0:47:43.819,0:47:51.949
not that kind of a thing but what I

0:47:46.189,0:47:54.429
perceived is that he didn't I don't see

0:47:51.949,0:47:54.429
you as

0:48:22.329,0:48:39.230
okay Sebastian I won't use his specific

0:48:36.680,0:48:41.210
thing but because it actually

0:48:39.230,0:48:42.140
disappeared a couple other of your

0:48:41.210,0:48:45.349
boyfriend's too

0:48:42.140,0:48:50.589
and they didn't know what it it takes

0:48:45.349,0:48:50.589
for a man to please a woman and

0:48:50.710,0:48:58.640
presumably to hold on to that woman if

0:48:54.500,0:49:00.230
he wants to do that now if he's just

0:48:58.640,0:49:05.089
playing or doesn't care than they did

0:49:00.230,0:49:08.990
you know how much does it matter but in

0:49:05.089,0:49:13.880
the case of rich what I've observed

0:49:08.990,0:49:17.809
about him and what I believe is and will

0:49:13.880,0:49:19.460
be the case is that he loves you very

0:49:17.809,0:49:21.680
much

0:49:19.460,0:49:23.539
you don't want to lose him for sure but

0:49:21.680,0:49:29.779
he certainly does not want to lose you

0:49:23.539,0:49:32.740
and he's he's smart enough it's not just

0:49:29.779,0:49:37.779
you know mental smartness but he's

0:49:32.740,0:49:46.819
clever enough to do whatever it takes to

0:49:37.779,0:49:48.759
make sure that you do stay with him and

0:49:46.819,0:49:51.799
that was not necessarily a trait of his

0:49:48.759,0:49:56.740
predecessors and the result of it was

0:49:51.799,0:49:59.859
that you know they they did lose you and

0:49:56.740,0:50:02.690
of course I'm prejudiced about you but

0:49:59.859,0:50:07.609
I'd feel sorry for any man that loses

0:50:02.690,0:50:10.279
you it's just like he's a fighter and he

0:50:07.609,0:50:11.880
was just do you like makes it clear what

0:50:10.279,0:50:17.460
it is that he wants

0:50:11.880,0:50:19.050
and you like gorgeous for a team I was

0:50:17.460,0:50:21.480
I've never been a team like that before

0:50:19.050,0:50:23.250
it's different no it doesn't need to be

0:50:21.480,0:50:25.710
like a comparison between him and

0:50:23.250,0:50:27.720
everyone well what's the question

0:50:25.710,0:50:31.740
actually I turned around because I

0:50:27.720,0:50:34.260
really don't have any knowledge

0:50:31.740,0:50:36.660
I'm sure he has some faults don't we all

0:50:34.260,0:50:40.830
but I don't have any knowledge of any

0:50:36.660,0:50:43.020
faults and certainly none that have you

0:50:40.830,0:50:45.680
know come between you and him in your

0:50:43.020,0:50:45.680
relationship

0:50:52.250,0:51:00.000
what's something I could do that would

0:50:57.960,0:51:02.810
make you refuse to ever talk to me again

0:51:00.000,0:51:02.810
well

0:51:10.040,0:51:15.380
okay what's the one piece of advice you

0:51:13.010,0:51:20.570
have for me regarding a successful

0:51:15.380,0:51:24.430
marriage no I sort of touched on it

0:51:20.570,0:51:28.610
before but the implication is not that

0:51:24.430,0:51:31.550
rich or the main is the one that has the

0:51:28.610,0:51:37.130
total responsibility of making a

0:51:31.550,0:51:44.110
marriage work and what I really said

0:51:37.130,0:51:47.480
about him knowing how to keep a woman I

0:51:44.110,0:51:51.410
would say that about you too

0:51:47.480,0:51:53.330
in reference to him and did I said you

0:51:51.410,0:51:55.730
know you you want to keep him being once

0:51:53.330,0:52:01.100
keep you and if you want you want to

0:51:55.730,0:52:05.330
keep him then you it's not a question of

0:52:01.100,0:52:08.300
acquiescing or being bullied or anything

0:52:05.330,0:52:14.630
like that clearly those are unacceptable

0:52:08.300,0:52:18.140
behaviors but you should do everything

0:52:14.630,0:52:26.740
that's possible to make the person that

0:52:18.140,0:52:26.740
you love happy within reason okay

0:52:30.930,0:52:35.160
what have I done or what happened to me

0:52:33.569,0:52:46.200
that scared you the most

0:52:35.160,0:52:48.450
why because I said before that it was

0:52:46.200,0:52:50.069
something I appreciated about you sort

0:52:48.450,0:52:51.720
of but when you went to China and you

0:52:50.069,0:52:57.030
didn't listen to us and then you fell

0:52:51.720,0:52:59.760
that was scary but I mean I wish it

0:52:57.030,0:53:06.420
hadn't happened I don't know that I wish

0:52:59.760,0:53:09.059
you hadn't gone I think I just I don't

0:53:06.420,0:53:10.950
know you're you're not going anywhere

0:53:09.059,0:53:12.990
anytime soon but you are getting older

0:53:10.950,0:53:16.559
and that scares me and I just don't want

0:53:12.990,0:53:19.619
anything to happen to you so it just

0:53:16.559,0:53:21.510
felt reckless when you found out you

0:53:19.619,0:53:27.839
were sick and the doctor said for you to

0:53:21.510,0:53:28.680
stay and then you were like oh I need to

0:53:27.839,0:53:30.569
go to China

0:53:28.680,0:53:32.970
I need to do that and in a weird way I

0:53:30.569,0:53:34.589
can appreciate it I think I could at the

0:53:32.970,0:53:39.150
time even as I was fighting with you

0:53:34.589,0:53:41.000
about it but I just I knew if the tables

0:53:39.150,0:53:43.230
were turned you would never have

0:53:41.000,0:53:44.220
advocated for me to do that you would

0:53:43.230,0:53:46.170
have wanted me to start getting

0:53:44.220,0:53:49.710
treatment immediately and fix everything

0:53:46.170,0:53:56.760
and make it better and it was hard for

0:53:49.710,0:53:59.430
me to know that you that that wasn't

0:53:56.760,0:54:01.740
your first priority or maybe you just

0:53:59.430,0:54:04.980
you look felt like you were invincible

0:54:01.740,0:54:08.910
or something and it just scared me that

0:54:04.980,0:54:11.220
something was gonna happen and then when

0:54:08.910,0:54:17.369
you fell because like all the way worse

0:54:11.220,0:54:18.930
fear is happening at one time I think I

0:54:17.369,0:54:21.030
forgot what the question was what was

0:54:18.930,0:54:26.010
the question something I did that scared

0:54:21.030,0:54:28.950
you I think that was probably it

0:54:26.010,0:54:31.260
scared you yet this yeah I think just

0:54:28.950,0:54:33.290
you and again I understand it there

0:54:31.260,0:54:37.680
isn't even an explanation but I just

0:54:33.290,0:54:42.329
it's I think sometimes you don't put

0:54:37.680,0:54:47.579
your health first like when you hardly

0:54:42.329,0:54:51.210
ever get sick and so when you do you you

0:54:47.579,0:54:53.910
act like that you know like what you say

0:54:51.210,0:54:55.740
like I can never get sick or something

0:54:53.910,0:54:57.450
like that and it's just it's not the

0:54:55.740,0:55:00.450
case I mean it's funny when we're like

0:54:57.450,0:55:01.980
little kids and you say it but I'm not a

0:55:00.450,0:55:05.849
little kid anymore and when you're

0:55:01.980,0:55:09.450
actually sick and something could really

0:55:05.849,0:55:13.200
happen it just felt so selfish I think

0:55:09.450,0:55:15.599
in that moment that you left which is

0:55:13.200,0:55:18.180
not fair it wasn't fair of me to look at

0:55:15.599,0:55:19.829
it like that but I just if God forbid

0:55:18.180,0:55:22.109
something had happened to you

0:55:19.829,0:55:24.119
and you came back and the treatment had

0:55:22.109,0:55:25.740
started too late and something happened

0:55:24.119,0:55:27.510
and you weren't here I think it would

0:55:25.740,0:55:31.109
have been really hard for me to forgive

0:55:27.510,0:55:33.410
that I do appreciate what you're saying

0:55:31.109,0:55:36.180
of course you shared that opinion with

0:55:33.410,0:55:42.900
not so much your mom she was convinced

0:55:36.180,0:55:45.690
but your other siblings but I did act on

0:55:42.900,0:55:49.290
the advice of doctors I just didn't go

0:55:45.690,0:55:52.170
away as a renegade so I know just wasn't

0:55:49.290,0:55:53.760
the safest thing yes the accident I had

0:55:52.170,0:55:56.309
in China nothing to do with the other

0:55:53.760,0:55:58.140
you know that was just but that's still

0:55:56.309,0:55:59.910
sort of stems from the same thing it

0:55:58.140,0:56:02.510
still stems from you being stubborn and

0:55:59.910,0:56:05.880
like needing to climb to the top and

0:56:02.510,0:56:08.520
needing to do that and it's it's like a

0:56:05.880,0:56:11.010
downfall and a positive because I

0:56:08.520,0:56:13.829
appreciate that you do that and that you

0:56:11.010,0:56:16.530
are a fighter I mean I have that from

0:56:13.829,0:56:17.970
you a mom like you guys just fight when

0:56:16.530,0:56:22.680
everything was happening with my lung

0:56:17.970,0:56:24.690
and I like I remember how scared you

0:56:22.680,0:56:27.150
guys were and it was like we've flipped

0:56:24.690,0:56:29.069
roles I was like no it's gonna be fine I

0:56:27.150,0:56:31.470
have this it's taken care of I'm going

0:56:29.069,0:56:33.450
to I'm going into surgery tomorrow you

0:56:31.470,0:56:34.710
just need to hear that I mean I have

0:56:33.450,0:56:37.020
that from you guys and

0:56:34.710,0:56:39.680
I appreciate that quality but when the

0:56:37.020,0:56:42.119
tables are turned and it feels like you

0:56:39.680,0:56:43.500
like something really terrible could

0:56:42.119,0:56:46.530
have happened and I had no control over

0:56:43.500,0:56:49.849
it I didn't I mean what would I have

0:56:46.530,0:56:54.869
done if you weren't here you know

0:56:49.849,0:57:00.900
well I'm gratified by how you feel how

0:56:54.869,0:57:04.980
you felt that would be do whatever to

0:57:00.900,0:57:08.339
tell you what I don't care so it's not

0:57:04.980,0:57:13.230
that I wasn't aware of how all of you

0:57:08.339,0:57:15.450
felt but again I wasn't not to put us

0:57:13.230,0:57:17.430
through torture during that time well

0:57:15.450,0:57:19.170
you really didn't want to do that you

0:57:17.430,0:57:21.359
know that's the thing I understand why

0:57:19.170,0:57:24.750
you did it but it was awful like going

0:57:21.359,0:57:26.070
through it it was really scary like just

0:57:24.750,0:57:27.630
having that in the back of our heads

0:57:26.070,0:57:29.670
that you were delaying treatment and

0:57:27.630,0:57:32.460
then we knew like when the accident

0:57:29.670,0:57:34.200
happened and everything it's just it was

0:57:32.460,0:57:35.970
like our worst fears were like all

0:57:34.200,0:57:37.770
happening at the same time and it was

0:57:35.970,0:57:40.970
and then to have you come back and be

0:57:37.770,0:57:44.520
like feel like you would kind of like

0:57:40.970,0:57:46.830
basically seen death almost is like you

0:57:44.520,0:57:49.859
described it at that time it was just I

0:57:46.830,0:57:52.200
was so upset and like angry with you for

0:57:49.859,0:57:54.240
having done that and again looking back

0:57:52.200,0:57:56.760
it's everything worked out and it's hard

0:57:54.240,0:58:00.060
for me to like feel still feel that way

0:57:56.760,0:58:02.400
but I was it's one of a few times that I

0:58:00.060,0:58:06.230
was really angry with you for having

0:58:02.400,0:58:11.700
because it just felt so selfish well

0:58:06.230,0:58:19.580
your mom with me made the decision to

0:58:11.700,0:58:19.580
parcel out updates on my condition and

0:58:19.760,0:58:27.540
ward or not it was a she that made that

0:58:22.710,0:58:30.470
decision I think it was exactly the

0:58:27.540,0:58:32.730
appropriate thing to do now of course I

0:58:30.470,0:58:34.859
know what's going through you but yeah

0:58:32.730,0:58:37.440
but if I didn't how would you feel we've

0:58:34.859,0:58:39.119
had that discussion but under the

0:58:37.440,0:58:41.500
circumstances it wasn't like I was

0:58:39.119,0:58:44.560
around the corner where you know I

0:58:41.500,0:58:49.630
I was in China there was a lot anybody

0:58:44.560,0:58:51.820
could do it was just the decision to go

0:58:49.630,0:58:55.120
the other part of it was unforeseen but

0:58:51.820,0:58:57.610
the reason why you fell is the same

0:58:55.120,0:59:00.100
reason as to as like why you went it's

0:58:57.610,0:59:02.050
like you needed to just show that you

0:59:00.100,0:59:03.700
could do it that you were not strong and

0:59:02.050,0:59:05.620
sometimes I wish you would just do it

0:59:03.700,0:59:08.800
and you did do it and that's the point

0:59:05.620,0:59:11.410
like I I can appreciate it and it also

0:59:08.800,0:59:13.990
just frustrates me at the same time

0:59:11.410,0:59:16.180
because so much of it could have the

0:59:13.990,0:59:18.580
anxiety they like all of us went through

0:59:16.180,0:59:22.210
could have been avoided but I understand

0:59:18.580,0:59:24.370
why you did it I do I just well I just

0:59:22.210,0:59:30.070
wish it hadn't happened it was awful

0:59:24.370,0:59:31.390
I do understand I'm not gonna say if

0:59:30.070,0:59:32.680
something like that happened it would be

0:59:31.390,0:59:34.600
different because nothing like that's

0:59:32.680,0:59:39.220
going to happen anymore I was it's an

0:59:34.600,0:59:43.450
easy hollow promise to make but I can't

0:59:39.220,0:59:49.140
really say that in either of those

0:59:43.450,0:59:52.270
circumstances in the first case I had

0:59:49.140,0:59:55.300
specific permission by several doctors

0:59:52.270,0:59:57.970
okay they assured me that putting it off

0:59:55.300,1:00:02.290
for a few weeks was not going to worsen

0:59:57.970,1:00:04.180
the problem and I know how you felt your

1:00:02.290,1:00:07.150
mother felt that way too up to a point

1:00:04.180,1:00:13.870
then she just sort of backed off the

1:00:07.150,1:00:18.120
accident I had in China we were walking

1:00:13.870,1:00:22.120
a narrow line there I mean if I were

1:00:18.120,1:00:25.170
close to dying or something a problem we

1:00:22.120,1:00:28.960
even if your mom had from the beginning

1:00:25.170,1:00:32.170
and I shouldn't say if I were I perhaps

1:00:28.960,1:00:35.320
was at one point but you've got over it

1:00:32.170,1:00:41.050
quickly I wasn't I wasn't in danger and

1:00:35.320,1:00:44.530
a point of dying and if your mother had

1:00:41.050,1:00:47.420
publicized that from the get-go there

1:00:44.530,1:00:52.220
would been the next day seven or more

1:00:47.420,1:00:54.410
no trips to China point I see yeah I

1:00:52.220,1:00:56.510
don't say about missing the point it's

1:00:54.410,1:00:58.579
just like all of that happened and

1:00:56.510,1:01:01.460
that's fine it's just I wish you hadn't

1:00:58.579,1:01:03.230
done it I wish you hadn't made the

1:01:01.460,1:01:06.319
decision to go everything that happened

1:01:03.230,1:01:08.329
from there on is to totally it's

1:01:06.319,1:01:10.579
somewhat removed there's the fact that

1:01:08.329,1:01:14.210
you went I wish you hadn't done that I

1:01:10.579,1:01:16.280
wish you hadn't needed to take that risk

1:01:14.210,1:01:17.960
like I would hope that if something like

1:01:16.280,1:01:19.579
that ever happened again in your face

1:01:17.960,1:01:21.980
with that decision that you'd remember

1:01:19.579,1:01:24.049
that there are a lot of people that care

1:01:21.980,1:01:26.510
about you being here and if the tables

1:01:24.049,1:01:28.099
were turned and a doctor said you can

1:01:26.510,1:01:29.359
start treatment immediately or you can

1:01:28.099,1:01:32.150
start treatment in three weeks you'd

1:01:29.359,1:01:47.809
have me there the next second if I could

1:01:32.150,1:01:49.490
that's my point okay points what what

1:01:47.809,1:01:57.430
are you worried about for me and my

1:01:49.490,1:02:02.299
future I don't worry about a lot for you

1:01:57.430,1:02:08.869
because of past experiences and your

1:02:02.299,1:02:12.829
past performance I think you positioned

1:02:08.869,1:02:15.140
yourself career-wise to where you're

1:02:12.829,1:02:19.520
embarking in a you know a new venture

1:02:15.140,1:02:23.000
now but you you have your skills and

1:02:19.520,1:02:24.589
your experience and you've distinguished

1:02:23.000,1:02:29.569
yourself and just about everything

1:02:24.589,1:02:31.730
you've done so I don't worry that if

1:02:29.569,1:02:33.349
something happened with your you know

1:02:31.730,1:02:36.770
attempt at a business or anything else

1:02:33.349,1:02:40.609
you you always have the capacity to take

1:02:36.770,1:02:45.049
care of yourself so I don't really I

1:02:40.609,1:02:50.569
don't really worry about any of that I'm

1:02:45.049,1:02:53.569
worried about your health I know that

1:02:50.569,1:02:57.049
you take very good care of yourself but

1:02:53.569,1:03:00.399
I still worry about your health

1:02:57.049,1:03:07.309
and worry about your state of mind

1:03:00.399,1:03:12.229
worried that that you sometimes just

1:03:07.309,1:03:14.509
become overly stressed because you're

1:03:12.229,1:03:17.269
you know I've said this before but

1:03:14.509,1:03:18.739
you're so organized that when you know

1:03:17.269,1:03:23.479
something this big and the scheme of

1:03:18.739,1:03:25.999
things is amiss for you sometimes not

1:03:23.479,1:03:29.119
all the times it becomes a major cause

1:03:25.999,1:03:36.130
of stress and I worry about that I wish

1:03:29.119,1:03:39.169
you had the capacity to just dismiss it

1:03:36.130,1:03:42.589
just not to expect such perfection from

1:03:39.169,1:03:44.439
yourself but you usually get it from

1:03:42.589,1:03:46.909
yourself that's the thing it's not like

1:03:44.439,1:03:50.089
you know here's a sloppy person looking

1:03:46.909,1:03:57.130
for perfection you generally are pretty

1:03:50.089,1:03:57.130
much perfection like turn

1:04:19.420,1:04:24.480
that's for you thank you for first okay

1:04:28.410,1:04:34.029
what's one thing you've learned from my

1:04:31.900,1:04:36.420
relationships that you'll carry into

1:04:34.029,1:04:36.420
yours

1:04:47.670,1:04:56.309
family first I think like beyond I'm

1:04:54.750,1:04:59.460
seeking more broadly than you and mom

1:04:56.309,1:05:02.549
but I just I think I've learned from you

1:04:59.460,1:05:09.089
how the importance of family and keeping

1:05:02.549,1:05:14.400
everyone together and just unconditional

1:05:09.089,1:05:15.930
love because you have that usually when

1:05:14.400,1:05:20.280
someone really pisses you off and they

1:05:15.930,1:05:22.500
you know family and unconditional life

1:05:20.280,1:05:28.829
well if you've learned those two things

1:05:22.500,1:05:35.220
I'm a success what do you see in my

1:05:28.829,1:05:36.960
future ten years from now well let's

1:05:35.220,1:05:44.089
start with the obvious ten years from

1:05:36.960,1:05:50.160
now hmm five six kids grandchildren

1:05:44.089,1:05:54.530
no I think in 10 years I'll see at least

1:05:50.160,1:05:59.670
a grandchild maybe more and maybe not

1:05:54.530,1:06:04.430
but that that's what I would predict

1:05:59.670,1:06:05.809
I see continued success in whatever

1:06:04.430,1:06:08.010
[Music]

1:06:05.809,1:06:15.089
financial or business ventures you're

1:06:08.010,1:06:17.130
entering into because that tendency for

1:06:15.089,1:06:19.650
perfection that I described as sometimes

1:06:17.130,1:06:23.940
being a negative it's certainly not all

1:06:19.650,1:06:27.799
negative and you have demonstrated in

1:06:23.940,1:06:31.170
the past that you have the capacity to

1:06:27.799,1:06:32.819
distinguish yourself in anything that

1:06:31.170,1:06:35.339
you've tried to do and that's all

1:06:32.819,1:06:38.790
inclusive I don't recall ever your

1:06:35.339,1:06:42.809
having you know attempted to do

1:06:38.790,1:06:45.390
something and again not distinguishing

1:06:42.809,1:06:48.390
yourself yourself I recall your having

1:06:45.390,1:06:52.680
given some things up but not not

1:06:48.390,1:06:54.800
distinguishing yourself and of course

1:06:52.680,1:06:59.970
you know what I'm referring to

1:06:54.800,1:07:01.680
martial arts which you took you took it

1:06:59.970,1:07:06.260
to an extreme point you were very close

1:07:01.680,1:07:06.260
to the black belt you gave that up but

1:07:07.400,1:07:17.610
again I see only I see this relationship

1:07:12.870,1:07:19.560
that you have with rich as ideal I know

1:07:17.610,1:07:21.420
that you care about for him and I know

1:07:19.560,1:07:26.160
that he cares about you I don't have any

1:07:21.420,1:07:28.470
doubt of that and you have a good

1:07:26.160,1:07:31.110
support system you have a good you know

1:07:28.470,1:07:33.780
family support system a lot of it rich

1:07:31.110,1:07:37.230
has a you know decent family support

1:07:33.780,1:07:40.770
system and both of you are smart and

1:07:37.230,1:07:42.690
both of you will accomplish whatever you

1:07:40.770,1:07:46.440
want to accomplish to whatever degree

1:07:42.690,1:07:50.690
you want to accomplish so I see success

1:07:46.440,1:07:54.470
I see grandchildren I hope I see

1:07:50.690,1:07:54.470
happiness all the time
