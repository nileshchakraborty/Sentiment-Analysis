0:02:04.310,0:02:09.950
seemed eager and excited and present and

0:02:07.250,0:02:14.870
that standing up kind of represents all

0:02:09.950,0:02:19.790
of that not in like a you know m'lady

0:02:14.870,0:02:21.110
not in a m'lady sort of way just just

0:02:19.790,0:02:23.630
you know you I don't need you to hold

0:02:21.110,0:02:26.239
doors open or anything but I just like

0:02:23.630,0:02:28.100
that you're you know you don't that you

0:02:26.239,0:02:30.320
you stood up and that it seemed like you

0:02:28.100,0:02:34.310
were excited for me to join you at the

0:02:30.320,0:02:37.790
table and I like that yeah what about me

0:02:34.310,0:02:40.939
I remember your smile I mean just

0:02:37.790,0:02:43.069
you know because you're I'm sitting

0:02:40.939,0:02:44.840
there I'm waiting I'm trying to kind of

0:02:43.069,0:02:47.180
maybe look busy not always looking at

0:02:44.840,0:02:48.530
the door waiting for the person that

0:02:47.180,0:02:51.140
looks like the photo to walk in the

0:02:48.530,0:02:53.450
person I've been talking to and then

0:02:51.140,0:02:57.409
when you came in and so obviously so

0:02:53.450,0:03:01.400
clearly you and that was very exciting

0:02:57.409,0:03:03.680
because you matched up with the image I

0:03:01.400,0:03:06.680
had built up as well just just very

0:03:03.680,0:03:08.150
quickly and how you expressed yourself

0:03:06.680,0:03:12.260
you know just in the moment to the

0:03:08.150,0:03:14.959
presence of course I remember yes that

0:03:12.260,0:03:18.650
big smile yeah taking up 90% of your

0:03:14.959,0:03:21.470
face and I don't I didn't think it was a

0:03:18.650,0:03:23.599
conscious choice to stand up here just

0:03:21.470,0:03:28.069
like that's yeah of course like oh I'm

0:03:23.599,0:03:32.739
gonna walk closer and say hi I remember

0:03:28.069,0:03:32.739
you being really animated very energetic

0:03:33.400,0:03:41.319
maybe it's because of what that guy was

0:03:37.879,0:03:44.449
it like a cow the cacao candy thing

0:03:41.319,0:03:48.650
basically cocaine basically cocaine but

0:03:44.449,0:03:53.000
I didn't mean to yes yeah it was great

0:03:48.650,0:03:56.870
yeah so you know this was like a first

0:03:53.000,0:04:00.560
day thing so in a way and sometimes you

0:03:56.870,0:04:02.120
know as the talkative kind of person you

0:04:00.560,0:04:05.299
know I end up finding myself having to

0:04:02.120,0:04:11.590
lead conversations and having toys drive

0:04:05.299,0:04:16.280
that momentum and all any any sense of

0:04:11.590,0:04:18.859
you know like weights or you know it was

0:04:16.280,0:04:22.520
upcoming difficulty was just dissipated

0:04:18.859,0:04:24.380
like within 30 seconds yeah it felt like

0:04:22.520,0:04:28.460
we knew each other yeah that's nice

0:04:24.380,0:04:30.880
comfortable exactly yeah all right is

0:04:28.460,0:04:30.880
the next question

0:04:32.539,0:04:49.169
when do you feel closest to me in some

0:04:44.759,0:04:52.979
ways may be lazy mornings you know just

0:04:49.169,0:04:55.770
in that physical intimacy of that just

0:04:52.979,0:04:58.770
being able to lay together be very

0:04:55.770,0:05:07.080
comfortable be good yeah

0:04:58.770,0:05:12.389
nuzzle it up I know so after after good

0:05:07.080,0:05:15.059
sex after that that sense of you know

0:05:12.389,0:05:18.830
that we managed to really satisfy each

0:05:15.059,0:05:22.529
other and that we were connected and

0:05:18.830,0:05:26.689
that that emotional connection was there

0:05:22.529,0:05:30.209
as well and we can just kind of bask in

0:05:26.689,0:05:33.719
in our in our abilities and in our in

0:05:30.209,0:05:38.300
our at each other it's I feel very loved

0:05:33.719,0:05:42.149
and it's it's it's a very nice feeling

0:05:38.300,0:05:48.059
yeah well yeah I guess those moments we

0:05:42.149,0:05:50.839
are together in our own space yeah how

0:05:48.059,0:05:55.379
are you know I agree with you about sex

0:05:50.839,0:05:59.069
post-sex you know I just but I think

0:05:55.379,0:06:01.709
also when we're creating something

0:05:59.069,0:06:04.349
together when we're writing together and

0:06:01.709,0:06:05.789
it just feels really productive and I

0:06:04.349,0:06:07.529
say something and then you say something

0:06:05.789,0:06:09.360
and then I write something and then you

0:06:07.529,0:06:10.800
do something and and it just feels like

0:06:09.360,0:06:13.679
we're building off this momentum and I

0:06:10.800,0:06:16.800
just feel like it's such an obvious

0:06:13.679,0:06:19.169
closeness that we have that we can we

0:06:16.800,0:06:21.629
can bounce those things around really

0:06:19.169,0:06:24.719
quickly and and have something to show

0:06:21.629,0:06:33.569
for that just like I don't know shows

0:06:24.719,0:06:39.670
how close we are it's not a competition

0:06:33.569,0:06:44.880
well what are you hesitant

0:06:39.670,0:06:52.620
tell me has a tenth of Terra yeah yeah

0:06:44.880,0:06:55.870
Wow I I don't I don't know I feel like

0:06:52.620,0:07:00.010
we share everything you know I mean you

0:06:55.870,0:07:03.670
know about issues in my past and exes

0:07:00.010,0:07:05.590
and crushes and you know any a lot of

0:07:03.670,0:07:08.440
the things that couples are hesitant to

0:07:05.590,0:07:12.640
share or never do or you know my kinks

0:07:08.440,0:07:14.230
or my you know my annoyances and

0:07:12.640,0:07:20.280
grievances like those those are things

0:07:14.230,0:07:22.630
that we talk about constantly so I

0:07:20.280,0:07:26.220
really don't feel like I ever hesitate

0:07:22.630,0:07:28.770
to share anything with you probably

0:07:26.220,0:07:32.860
sometimes you wish I would maybe

0:07:28.770,0:07:35.620
hesitate a bit more sharing things but I

0:07:32.860,0:07:36.970
really you know I you know that I can't

0:07:35.620,0:07:39.490
as soon as something comes up I have to

0:07:36.970,0:07:43.060
tell you even if it's not at the right

0:07:39.490,0:07:44.800
time so there's no question you were

0:07:43.060,0:07:47.470
like oh I hope that's not a question

0:07:44.800,0:07:49.870
that eh yeah no you know and I've been

0:07:47.470,0:07:52.030
thinking about it the last couple days

0:07:49.870,0:07:57.370
and there hasn't been anything that I'm

0:07:52.030,0:08:02.070
like oh god I really I feel like I am as

0:07:57.370,0:08:02.070
open as I can be with someone with you

0:08:02.460,0:08:09.400
yeah is there anything you're hesitant I

0:08:06.280,0:08:11.050
think anything that was a reluctance at

0:08:09.400,0:08:16.300
any point I've already shared with you

0:08:11.050,0:08:20.140
you know there were any parts that maybe

0:08:16.300,0:08:21.910
I was insecure about or oh you know I've

0:08:20.140,0:08:25.150
been really shared this part of myself

0:08:21.910,0:08:29.770
completely yet I definitely feel like I

0:08:25.150,0:08:32.620
have there are no it's sighs it's not

0:08:29.770,0:08:37.150
exciting right that's not I wish there

0:08:32.620,0:08:39.630
is like a little something I never told

0:08:37.150,0:08:39.630
you about it

0:08:46.340,0:08:53.800
yeah first unfortunate lack of the

0:08:49.370,0:08:53.800
excitement of it no yeah

0:08:56.330,0:09:00.520
[Laughter]

0:09:00.700,0:09:06.680
what was the last trip that connected us

0:09:03.440,0:09:17.450
and why the last trip that connected us

0:09:06.680,0:09:21.290
yeah and why I know we go on somewhat

0:09:17.450,0:09:22.940
each other we do or one of the the best

0:09:21.290,0:09:25.550
trip that I linked at us anyway what

0:09:22.940,0:09:26.720
comes to mind is Israel you know what

0:09:25.550,0:09:31.520
you asked that question something last

0:09:26.720,0:09:33.980
trip I by any means but yeah because you

0:09:31.520,0:09:35.510
know yeah I saw you visit you in

0:09:33.980,0:09:39.980
Istanbul then there's that time apart

0:09:35.510,0:09:44.060
and then relatively quickly it felt we

0:09:39.980,0:09:46.400
you know travel together to Israel to to

0:09:44.060,0:09:50.750
go to Jordan and all that and that was

0:09:46.400,0:09:54.050
you know intense weekend a bit of us

0:09:50.750,0:09:57.260
just traveling and figuring out each

0:09:54.050,0:09:58.490
other's rhythms no Wade you know known

0:09:57.260,0:10:01.220
each other for what like three months

0:09:58.490,0:10:09.160
pretty much yeah and most of its through

0:10:01.220,0:10:09.160
a computer screen yeah so you know you

0:10:09.370,0:10:15.080
think you saw me as me and I gonna see

0:10:12.200,0:10:19.570
you as you and I think it was exciting

0:10:15.080,0:10:23.720
to get our ideas of each other confirmed

0:10:19.570,0:10:25.760
to you know be pushed into a highly kind

0:10:23.720,0:10:27.800
of stressful situation but of course oh

0:10:25.760,0:10:30.230
so this was our earlier can I trip

0:10:27.800,0:10:33.070
together so maybe there was some aspect

0:10:30.230,0:10:38.690
or we got our best behavior or this that

0:10:33.070,0:10:41.420
but I'd like to think otherwise and you

0:10:38.690,0:10:44.200
know I I was there a bit longer and then

0:10:41.420,0:10:46.310
we talked while I was outside the museum

0:10:44.200,0:10:49.700
and we talked about what you're gonna be

0:10:46.310,0:10:53.650
doing next summer and whether you'd be

0:10:49.700,0:10:57.740
coming to the Netherlands or waiting so

0:10:53.650,0:10:59.000
it was highly kind of emotional and

0:10:57.740,0:11:01.430
exciting to

0:10:59.000,0:11:03.410
find out what that conclusion was going

0:11:01.430,0:11:07.580
to be and that you did decide to come

0:11:03.410,0:11:11.690
sooner than later I was maybe a bit

0:11:07.580,0:11:13.490
worried that you would feel like you

0:11:11.690,0:11:15.290
would we're going to miss out on one

0:11:13.490,0:11:21.680
thing that you really wanted instead of

0:11:15.290,0:11:23.090
the other thing but I think I like to

0:11:21.680,0:11:25.760
think the way the right choice said I'm

0:11:23.090,0:11:35.480
not really happy that you came he did so

0:11:25.760,0:11:38.060
yeah that really connected us I feel I I

0:11:35.480,0:11:41.860
was thinking the trip the latest trip

0:11:38.060,0:11:46.310
that connected us was best kept secret

0:11:41.860,0:11:48.590
the festival you know we had a little

0:11:46.310,0:11:52.030
road trip down there to the south and

0:11:48.590,0:11:54.290
then we worked on building this festival

0:11:52.030,0:11:58.160
together I just saw you had like some

0:11:54.290,0:12:01.100
manual labor and you know waking up

0:11:58.160,0:12:03.710
early and trekking to the site and then

0:12:01.100,0:12:07.070
your second all-time it was so sick but

0:12:03.710,0:12:09.890
we you know we push through and we met

0:12:07.070,0:12:11.690
people and and we were camping and not

0:12:09.890,0:12:14.990
really sleeping because it's a festival

0:12:11.690,0:12:16.970
I don't know what we were expecting but

0:12:14.990,0:12:21.200
you know actually literally sharing a

0:12:16.970,0:12:24.020
tiny tent and not the best weather and

0:12:21.200,0:12:25.610
but then we had those that moment when

0:12:24.020,0:12:26.960
the festival doors opened and we were

0:12:25.610,0:12:29.270
all like standing there together and

0:12:26.960,0:12:32.210
seeing what we had created or been part

0:12:29.270,0:12:33.380
of creating and then we got to actually

0:12:32.210,0:12:36.620
stay for the whole festival and

0:12:33.380,0:12:38.870
experience that music and Sunday morning

0:12:36.620,0:12:41.870
I think was it like really solidified

0:12:38.870,0:12:43.430
that connection for us for me you know

0:12:41.870,0:12:46.850
happy like lying there in the morning

0:12:43.430,0:12:48.980
and listening to agree with Jonny

0:12:46.850,0:12:51.050
Greenwood and the orchestra and it was

0:12:48.980,0:12:52.730
like raining and relying on the picnic

0:12:51.050,0:12:54.980
blanket and you know we're a little

0:12:52.730,0:12:57.020
hungover from the weekend but you're

0:12:54.980,0:13:00.050
holding hands and just like really in

0:12:57.020,0:13:02.000
that music really connected yeah and

0:13:00.050,0:13:05.450
then stumbling upon some other bands

0:13:02.000,0:13:07.700
before leaving tora tora and then

0:13:05.450,0:13:10.370
sitting on the beach across from the

0:13:07.700,0:13:12.110
festival before leaving just listening

0:13:10.370,0:13:15.360
to an echoing across the

0:13:12.110,0:13:23.300
as I was really great yeah I felt really

0:13:15.360,0:13:23.300
really connected to you yeah

0:13:25.390,0:13:29.720
what is the biggest challenge to our

0:13:27.680,0:13:39.320
relationship and how do you think we can

0:13:29.720,0:13:47.240
solve it biggest challenge I don't think

0:13:39.320,0:13:49.970
it's lack of communication but I think

0:13:47.240,0:13:51.980
it's sometimes finding the right way to

0:13:49.970,0:13:58.190
communicate what we need to communicate

0:13:51.980,0:13:59.660
I think that that just comes from being

0:13:58.190,0:14:00.680
different people alright coming from

0:13:59.660,0:14:05.870
different families and different

0:14:00.680,0:14:07.610
countries and and having and as similar

0:14:05.870,0:14:11.300
as we are in so many ways and even as

0:14:07.610,0:14:16.730
our families are you know the way that

0:14:11.300,0:14:19.160
you express yourself sometimes is it's

0:14:16.730,0:14:20.540
hard for me to interpret you know and

0:14:19.160,0:14:23.810
and but we're learning we're learning

0:14:20.540,0:14:26.180
how to figure that out as we go along

0:14:23.810,0:14:29.390
and I think we're both patient people

0:14:26.180,0:14:31.010
and will over communicate until we

0:14:29.390,0:14:33.500
figure out why we can't communicate and

0:14:31.010,0:14:37.730
then continue to communicate so I think

0:14:33.500,0:14:39.170
that that works for us you know wanting

0:14:37.730,0:14:41.900
to communicate and wanting to figure out

0:14:39.170,0:14:43.700
exactly why why is there confusion here

0:14:41.900,0:14:47.450
why aren't we understanding one another

0:14:43.700,0:14:49.250
and figuring out so we're we're we're

0:14:47.450,0:14:52.550
working on it I mean I've been I've been

0:14:49.250,0:14:54.860
and really just before we're talking too

0:14:52.550,0:14:58.310
much was actually the problem I mean in

0:14:54.860,0:15:01.610
some ways because they've just become

0:14:58.310,0:15:03.230
this cycle of trying to talk about the

0:15:01.610,0:15:04.610
issue and talking about that issue which

0:15:03.230,0:15:05.690
cause another issue which got another I

0:15:04.610,0:15:07.970
should not obviously those weren't

0:15:05.690,0:15:11.630
didn't create a healthy relationship I

0:15:07.970,0:15:13.730
mean is that a worry you would ever have

0:15:11.630,0:15:16.550
that would over communicate things no

0:15:13.730,0:15:22.160
I'm I'm not worried about that because I

0:15:16.550,0:15:26.000
think that we both like like to have a

0:15:22.160,0:15:28.310
conclusion you know we like it to to get

0:15:26.000,0:15:30.320
somewhere and so I don't think we leave

0:15:28.310,0:15:33.110
things open ended you know you know you

0:15:30.320,0:15:34.610
don't like to go to bed without solving

0:15:33.110,0:15:36.500
whatever issues at hand

0:15:34.610,0:15:40.010
and I think that's a good way to be and

0:15:36.500,0:15:42.110
I think we kind of do that regardless of

0:15:40.010,0:15:44.720
it's nighttime or daytime you know

0:15:42.110,0:15:47.000
wherever we are we want to make sure we

0:15:44.720,0:15:49.070
resolve whatever the thing it is we need

0:15:47.000,0:15:51.920
to talk about and usually we do so

0:15:49.070,0:16:00.260
pretty quickly because yeah we listen to

0:15:51.920,0:16:03.470
each other and we figure it out oh you

0:16:00.260,0:16:13.029
want me to yeah why not the biggest

0:16:03.470,0:16:15.260
challenge in our relationship um I think

0:16:13.029,0:16:18.579
that yeah well you talk about one aspect

0:16:15.260,0:16:23.680
I think for some ways we're going to

0:16:18.579,0:16:29.269
we're gonna have to figure out how we

0:16:23.680,0:16:31.730
balance our you know ambitions as they

0:16:29.269,0:16:34.190
relate to you know creativity to our

0:16:31.730,0:16:37.100
careers to you know how we want to

0:16:34.190,0:16:40.670
survive as as people and how that

0:16:37.100,0:16:43.010
connects into our relationship and you

0:16:40.670,0:16:44.750
know that that level of partnership as

0:16:43.010,0:16:46.070
well you know you talked about the

0:16:44.750,0:16:48.680
intimacy you feel when we work together

0:16:46.070,0:16:51.860
and I feel - so that's a very exciting

0:16:48.680,0:16:53.480
thing but I I suspect maybe I'm just

0:16:51.860,0:16:55.160
seeing about being anxious but I suspect

0:16:53.480,0:16:59.029
that the owners gonna be challenges

0:16:55.160,0:17:00.680
facing that as well and you know as we

0:16:59.029,0:17:03.980
try and find our place more yeah we're

0:17:00.680,0:17:06.010
still kind of both searching a bit so I

0:17:03.980,0:17:08.120
think part of that challenge which

0:17:06.010,0:17:10.790
doesn't seem insurmountable seems like

0:17:08.120,0:17:13.309
something we can definitely handle is

0:17:10.790,0:17:15.549
how how are we gonna move forward

0:17:13.309,0:17:19.790
together how are we gonna collectively

0:17:15.549,0:17:21.579
find go towards our ambitions and that's

0:17:19.790,0:17:24.319
it's it's an exciting challenge in a way

0:17:21.579,0:17:25.370
that's it's fun to think that that is

0:17:24.319,0:17:29.929
probably the biggest thing we're gonna

0:17:25.370,0:17:32.350
have to deal with yeah yeah it's a biter

0:17:29.929,0:17:32.350
yeah

0:17:36.800,0:17:43.400
when was the last time I disappointed

0:17:39.540,0:17:43.400
you and how do you feel about it now

0:17:43.670,0:17:54.240
that's actually at the at the Film

0:17:52.680,0:17:55.830
Festival at the blik - nothing

0:17:54.240,0:17:58.230
yes yeah I mean that's the last thing I

0:17:55.830,0:18:01.260
can think about the last time you know I

0:17:58.230,0:18:03.900
was minor relative and minor we had to

0:18:01.260,0:18:05.730
do this kind of thing just you know and

0:18:03.900,0:18:07.830
together with all the other people

0:18:05.730,0:18:10.020
sitting in the theater sitting outside

0:18:07.830,0:18:14.730
the theater and I think they asked a

0:18:10.020,0:18:19.260
question if yeah if you were - how would

0:18:14.730,0:18:22.260
you seduce me and in my mind was like

0:18:19.260,0:18:24.570
okay so yeah how would I say this er

0:18:22.260,0:18:26.100
just like as we are and then you said

0:18:24.570,0:18:28.800
something and then I misinterpreted it

0:18:26.100,0:18:30.480
as say like we don't know each other and

0:18:28.800,0:18:32.190
then I'd you know you know yeah I

0:18:30.480,0:18:34.860
attempted to do then that thing and then

0:18:32.190,0:18:36.510
I felt like I put myself like okay I'm

0:18:34.860,0:18:39.809
gonna pretend she's someone I don't know

0:18:36.510,0:18:43.230
ish and I'm gonna do whatever ability to

0:18:39.809,0:18:45.090
flirt that I have and then I felt at the

0:18:43.230,0:18:49.740
time you guys shut it down because it

0:18:45.090,0:18:52.730
wasn't what the actual assignment was so

0:18:49.740,0:18:55.170
what disappointed me was that I I felt

0:18:52.730,0:18:57.330
yeah I felt like you know I'm like

0:18:55.170,0:19:05.610
almost as if I'm at like asking a girl

0:18:57.330,0:19:07.620
out to be like Roy and it bummed me out

0:19:05.610,0:19:09.240
but and then we got like into like a

0:19:07.620,0:19:12.590
little argument right there in the

0:19:09.240,0:19:15.120
moment which felt like it too obvious

0:19:12.590,0:19:19.559
which frustrated me as well like oh

0:19:15.120,0:19:21.030
great they got to us already yeah that's

0:19:19.559,0:19:22.860
before we signed up for this thing and

0:19:21.030,0:19:27.660
but we talked about it right then and

0:19:22.860,0:19:29.190
there and you know he said you're sorry

0:19:27.660,0:19:31.740
and then I explained what I was going on

0:19:29.190,0:19:35.480
my hands and then we and we worked it

0:19:31.740,0:19:35.480
out so that's it

0:19:43.730,0:19:55.070
after all that gold you ever see her

0:19:52.070,0:19:55.070
yeah

0:19:58.160,0:20:06.960
one two test test

0:20:00.620,0:20:08.549
seduction sex yeah so we talked about it

0:20:06.960,0:20:11.400
we talked it through it was you know

0:20:08.549,0:20:14.280
obviously a minor thing but uh I guess I

0:20:11.400,0:20:17.460
just felt vulnerable so you felt

0:20:14.280,0:20:19.559
disappointed though me yeah I was

0:20:17.460,0:20:21.630
disappointed that I was disappointed

0:20:19.559,0:20:24.210
that I couldn't just you know play that

0:20:21.630,0:20:29.299
game and disappointed that you work in a

0:20:24.210,0:20:34.320
responds and I guess I'll wait it out

0:20:29.299,0:20:36.419
smashing noise I guess that's

0:20:34.320,0:20:39.210
disappointed also yeah like disappointed

0:20:36.419,0:20:41.400
in I didn't it didn't work I didn't -

0:20:39.210,0:20:45.470
this year and my so far with you in the

0:20:41.400,0:20:53.340
way that I hoped I would okay yeah yeah

0:20:45.470,0:20:54.929
how about you disappointed me that time

0:20:53.340,0:21:03.210
you didn't bring the picnic blanket you

0:20:54.929,0:21:05.760
know now uh disappointed me I'm s that's

0:21:03.210,0:21:06.960
pretty strong you know for me hmm if

0:21:05.760,0:21:10.110
someone disappoints me you know it's

0:21:06.960,0:21:11.610
like it's like when I'm not that I'm

0:21:10.110,0:21:13.289
comparing this to being a mother but you

0:21:11.610,0:21:15.900
know what I mean like when a mom is

0:21:13.289,0:21:17.370
disappointed that's like the worst thing

0:21:15.900,0:21:19.230
right it's a nursing degree

0:21:17.370,0:21:23.130
yeah we're not disappointed right yeah

0:21:19.230,0:21:24.990
so to me that's that's like stronger

0:21:23.130,0:21:26.730
it's more serious than like being

0:21:24.990,0:21:29.370
frustrated or being angry being

0:21:26.730,0:21:31.350
disappointed is like yeah letting

0:21:29.370,0:21:34.200
someone down and you know that that's

0:21:31.350,0:21:36.960
like the that's the hardest thing for me

0:21:34.200,0:21:39.710
it's like let myself roll let people

0:21:36.960,0:21:39.710
down so

0:21:39.840,0:21:52.500
you you disappointed me yeah now that

0:21:43.140,0:21:58.470
you've explained how serious honestly I

0:21:52.500,0:22:02.309
can't think of okay when you came to

0:21:58.470,0:22:04.740
Istanbul to visit and I felt like you

0:22:02.309,0:22:06.210
know you I had to work the day that you

0:22:04.740,0:22:09.570
arrived and you're flying all the way

0:22:06.210,0:22:11.460
from Amsterdam and it was the first time

0:22:09.570,0:22:13.470
we'd be seeing each other after meeting

0:22:11.460,0:22:19.049
here and then me going back home to

0:22:13.470,0:22:20.070
Istanbul and you weren't sure what you

0:22:19.049,0:22:21.720
were going to do the whole first day

0:22:20.070,0:22:22.980
because there'd be no way for me to let

0:22:21.720,0:22:25.590
you into my apartment you wouldn't know

0:22:22.980,0:22:29.610
where it was and I had to work until

0:22:25.590,0:22:33.419
like 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. so I created this

0:22:29.610,0:22:35.700
whole plan for you so you would have

0:22:33.419,0:22:38.250
like interesting things to see in places

0:22:35.700,0:22:42.419
to go and you wouldn't feel so lost in

0:22:38.250,0:22:43.860
such a city of chaos and I made this old

0:22:42.419,0:22:46.289
book and I talked to all these different

0:22:43.860,0:22:47.880
cafes and I I planned like different

0:22:46.289,0:22:49.710
routes for you and like different games

0:22:47.880,0:22:53.130
for you to play and I drew photos and I

0:22:49.710,0:22:54.690
drew a map and and then you showed up

0:22:53.130,0:22:56.520
and you're like oh my friends picking me

0:22:54.690,0:22:59.149
up so I'll see you later and I'm gonna

0:22:56.520,0:23:03.510
stay with him for the first couple days

0:22:59.149,0:23:06.899
and that like really really disappointed

0:23:03.510,0:23:08.490
me because I felt like I was so excited

0:23:06.899,0:23:12.990
to see you and I put so much effort into

0:23:08.490,0:23:15.779
yeah you know like a high school project

0:23:12.990,0:23:17.159
you know but I like I really put on my

0:23:15.779,0:23:18.570
heart into this and then you're just

0:23:17.159,0:23:20.070
like yeah yeah my friends picking me up

0:23:18.570,0:23:21.720
I'm gonna go stay in this like fancy

0:23:20.070,0:23:29.399
area of the city I'll see you in a

0:23:21.720,0:23:31.080
couple days yeah okay I don't think I

0:23:29.399,0:23:34.730
stayed there a couple days really

0:23:31.080,0:23:34.730
that's two days the first two days

0:23:38.030,0:23:41.650
[Laughter]

0:23:44.070,0:23:55.660
what is something I could have done to

0:23:46.540,0:23:58.320
support you during the abortion I think

0:23:55.660,0:24:04.740
I think he did a pretty good job

0:23:58.320,0:24:07.300
supporting me I think it would have been

0:24:04.740,0:24:09.880
you know I was I was mostly nervous

0:24:07.300,0:24:12.670
about interacting with the doctors that

0:24:09.880,0:24:15.820
would that was my biggest concern you

0:24:12.670,0:24:18.370
know of course I honestly it wasn't as

0:24:15.820,0:24:21.490
emotional about making that big choice

0:24:18.370,0:24:23.860
as I think it is for a lot of people it

0:24:21.490,0:24:25.870
wasn't as hard for me I knew the choice

0:24:23.860,0:24:28.300
that I wanted to make and that probably

0:24:25.870,0:24:31.600
was best for us as well obviously it was

0:24:28.300,0:24:35.800
best for us but yeah I knew that I

0:24:31.600,0:24:40.240
wanted to have an abortion so that

0:24:35.800,0:24:44.010
wasn't a big decision but for going to

0:24:40.240,0:24:46.540
the intake appointment by myself and

0:24:44.010,0:24:48.940
then having to make the decision do I

0:24:46.540,0:24:53.110
take the pill or you know do I come back

0:24:48.940,0:24:54.940
and have a surgery and am I fully under

0:24:53.110,0:24:57.190
or do I just do it with like local

0:24:54.940,0:24:58.870
anesthesia you know like what and -

0:24:57.190,0:25:00.880
making these choices that was really

0:24:58.870,0:25:04.150
hard for me and having that doctor who

0:25:00.880,0:25:07.890
wasn't very nice and you know that that

0:25:04.150,0:25:10.570
makes me like really emotional

0:25:07.890,0:25:12.820
more so vivid than anything else feeling

0:25:10.570,0:25:15.970
vulnerable already and then being by

0:25:12.820,0:25:20.320
myself and not having that support I

0:25:15.970,0:25:22.510
know you had to work but it was it was

0:25:20.320,0:25:24.090
hard and then what you weren't there or

0:25:22.510,0:25:27.250
something oh your friends were in town

0:25:24.090,0:25:29.170
that was the week before yeah your

0:25:27.250,0:25:31.750
friends were in town but I still like I

0:25:29.170,0:25:34.180
went and got tested to make sure that I

0:25:31.750,0:25:35.890
was they did the ultrasound to make sure

0:25:34.180,0:25:37.390
I was actually pregnant okay they're in

0:25:35.890,0:25:40.780
the same time this day your friends

0:25:37.390,0:25:43.780
arrived and you you wanted me to no no

0:25:40.780,0:25:46.090
no I do the pregnancy I took the

0:25:43.780,0:25:47.650
pregnancy test yeah

0:25:46.090,0:25:50.290
and then they were arriving like an

0:25:47.650,0:25:52.060
authority but the moment that your best

0:25:50.290,0:25:53.860
friends were arriving into town and you

0:25:52.060,0:25:56.380
kind of had encouraged me to take it and

0:25:53.860,0:25:58.810
then you went and hung out with them and

0:25:56.380,0:26:04.180
I was by myself at home like taking this

0:25:58.810,0:26:07.030
pregnancy test and I just felt like you

0:26:04.180,0:26:10.540
know maybe didn't realize like how how

0:26:07.030,0:26:13.120
emotional that would be yeah I remember

0:26:10.540,0:26:15.070
that conversation I mean I understand I

0:26:13.120,0:26:18.610
understand why you felt that I was

0:26:15.070,0:26:20.710
encouraging it at the time I thought

0:26:18.610,0:26:23.350
about this obviously recently and what

0:26:20.710,0:26:25.750
would have had been if you had waited a

0:26:23.350,0:26:27.460
few days and then taking it like you

0:26:25.750,0:26:30.220
know schrödinger's pregnancy or

0:26:27.460,0:26:34.270
something like what would have it

0:26:30.220,0:26:36.840
changed the dynamic wise I just remember

0:26:34.270,0:26:39.670
being on the phone with you and you

0:26:36.840,0:26:42.640
saying that you got the you got the test

0:26:39.670,0:26:44.200
or something and what I recall I said

0:26:42.640,0:26:46.480
like you know if you want to decide to

0:26:44.200,0:26:46.990
take it now that's sure if not that's

0:26:46.480,0:26:49.390
okay too

0:26:46.990,0:26:51.100
your probably sensed because you know me

0:26:49.390,0:26:54.610
that I like knowing things right away so

0:26:51.100,0:26:56.440
you felt that encouragement I think you

0:26:54.610,0:26:58.290
said I would rather you take the

0:26:56.440,0:27:00.820
pregnancy test now

0:26:58.290,0:27:03.130
why would why would we need to wait and

0:27:00.820,0:27:05.980
for me it was a matter of whether I'm

0:27:03.130,0:27:07.420
pregnant or not it is what it is at

0:27:05.980,0:27:10.120
least we can wait a couple days until

0:27:07.420,0:27:11.530
your friends leave your best friends

0:27:10.120,0:27:13.620
that you haven't seen in years yeah and

0:27:11.530,0:27:15.850
and you were kind of like let's just

0:27:13.620,0:27:18.310
let's just figure it out now let's just

0:27:15.850,0:27:20.920
know and that is one big difference

0:27:18.310,0:27:22.570
between you rather just like no now no

0:27:20.920,0:27:25.120
matter what and me it's like well it is

0:27:22.570,0:27:27.010
what it is let's just like wait wait to

0:27:25.120,0:27:33.820
open the box sure neighbor's cat or

0:27:27.010,0:27:35.230
whatever but okay but I think yeah just

0:27:33.820,0:27:38.020
just being a little more present and

0:27:35.230,0:27:41.590
then you did end up staying the next day

0:27:38.020,0:27:42.970
with me after the day I had the abortion

0:27:41.590,0:27:44.920
you stayed with me but then the next day

0:27:42.970,0:27:46.450
you were kind of just you were gonna go

0:27:44.920,0:27:47.800
do something else with some friends

0:27:46.450,0:27:50.380
you're gonna meet up with friends and

0:27:47.800,0:27:53.320
you go you're okay and I told you like

0:27:50.380,0:27:55.210
I'm not okay like I know that I seem

0:27:53.320,0:27:55.940
okay but I need your hair and you didn't

0:27:55.210,0:27:59.120
you stayed

0:27:55.940,0:28:01.100
so that you didn't provide the support

0:27:59.120,0:28:02.900
that I needed yeah because it was hard

0:28:01.100,0:28:05.270
to read sometimes exactly what you're

0:28:02.900,0:28:08.720
you know because yeah like you said it

0:28:05.270,0:28:11.930
wasn't it didn't have the stereotypical

0:28:08.720,0:28:14.510
kind of emotional white that you know

0:28:11.930,0:28:16.640
like whoa well one sided are we playing

0:28:14.510,0:28:18.290
every like making not to make it too

0:28:16.640,0:28:20.090
much of a big deal are we gonna push the

0:28:18.290,0:28:22.940
side it's like oh you know this is what

0:28:20.090,0:28:28.610
it is we'll move on or like oh my god

0:28:22.940,0:28:32.840
let's individual yeah so trying to find

0:28:28.610,0:28:35.630
that balance yeah that I think you know

0:28:32.840,0:28:37.670
you you were you got me any medicine I

0:28:35.630,0:28:38.300
needed you brought me food you got a hot

0:28:37.670,0:28:40.280
water bottle

0:28:38.300,0:28:43.130
you don't like everything and you're you

0:28:40.280,0:28:45.890
yeah everything you could do to help you

0:28:43.130,0:28:47.960
you were trying to do so you're very

0:28:45.890,0:28:49.580
very supportive and and present one shot

0:28:47.960,0:28:52.150
once I let you know that I needed you to

0:28:49.580,0:28:52.150
be good

0:28:57.440,0:29:08.270
do you really think we'll last yeah why

0:29:02.180,0:29:11.820
[Laughter]

0:29:08.270,0:29:15.680
that was enthusiastic yeah yeah this is

0:29:11.820,0:29:21.330
Suzy astok yes it's confident about it I

0:29:15.680,0:29:22.560
I see I see us I feel I feel we were

0:29:21.330,0:29:25.800
just we're in a committed relationship

0:29:22.560,0:29:28.440
yeah it's it's we're there we've

0:29:25.800,0:29:32.520
committed we we talked about the future

0:29:28.440,0:29:36.960
we imagined it we fantasize about the

0:29:32.520,0:29:38.940
possibilities and I you know probably

0:29:36.960,0:29:41.640
for longer than it was concrete for us

0:29:38.940,0:29:45.330
both knowing for sure I was always just

0:29:41.640,0:29:48.840
considering how things would be down the

0:29:45.330,0:29:50.430
line and whatever I imagined myself in

0:29:48.840,0:29:53.010
the future I always imagined it together

0:29:50.430,0:29:56.280
with you and I

0:29:53.010,0:30:01.680
I just I trust the dynamic we have I

0:29:56.280,0:30:05.960
feel I feel lucky to to be able to share

0:30:01.680,0:30:09.510
it share my experiences with you and to

0:30:05.960,0:30:14.000
be a part of my life it's such a

0:30:09.510,0:30:18.240
comforting and nice feeling and that's

0:30:14.000,0:30:20.550
if I am a bit if I'm happy that I can

0:30:18.240,0:30:25.830
infect you with my happiness or if I am

0:30:20.550,0:30:28.200

0:30:49.830,0:30:59.270
if anything were to happen for whatever

0:30:53.010,0:30:59.270
reason if things were to change for us I

0:31:00.000,0:31:06.510
I know that we will just we'll figure it

0:31:04.410,0:31:08.370

to make sure that we cause this little

0:31:14.190,0:31:21.770
pain as possible and it's nice to be

0:31:53.150,0:31:58.650
came to this discovery pretty early on

0:31:55.620,0:32:01.380
that what I have for you and what we

0:31:58.650,0:32:04.950
have for each other is forever love so

0:32:01.380,0:32:08.220
whatever that means you know even if we

0:32:04.950,0:32:10.770
didn't get married and we end up not

0:32:08.220,0:32:12.870
having children or you know whatever is

0:32:10.770,0:32:14.910
in store plenty of cats I mean I'm not

0:32:12.870,0:32:16.050
worried about that but whatever is in

0:32:14.910,0:32:21.300
store for us and we still have that

0:32:16.050,0:32:23.900
forever love that connection so will

0:32:21.300,0:32:27.200
last in whatever way that means yeah

0:32:23.900,0:32:27.200
forever love

0:32:30.540,0:32:42.220
what do you think I'm missing out by

0:32:33.250,0:32:49.260
being with you well I mean you're you're

0:32:42.220,0:32:51.610
younger than me you're 25 yes yes I am

0:32:49.260,0:33:03.610
age doesn't matter it's just a number

0:32:51.610,0:33:07.060
right 17 you're 25 and I'm 29 and I I

0:33:03.610,0:33:10.690
feel like I've lived 10 lives you know I

0:33:07.060,0:33:12.940
feel so lucky to have been able to live

0:33:10.690,0:33:16.960
in so many places and do so many things

0:33:12.940,0:33:19.600
and and have adventures and meet amazing

0:33:16.960,0:33:22.500
people and things I know you've done as

0:33:19.600,0:33:24.790
well but I feel like I've had more

0:33:22.500,0:33:28.390
opportunities to do so just because I'm

0:33:24.790,0:33:30.520
older and you know sometimes I find

0:33:28.390,0:33:33.070
myself saying when I was your age and I

0:33:30.520,0:33:34.690
don't mean it in that like I'm older

0:33:33.070,0:33:36.730
sort of way but like I'm like oh yeah

0:33:34.690,0:33:39.760
when I was 25 I was living in Istanbul I

0:33:36.730,0:33:44.610
was doing this I was Anna and I feel

0:33:39.760,0:33:51.130
like sometimes being with me and

0:33:44.610,0:33:54.160
settling down is somehow might limit you

0:33:51.130,0:33:58.240
and in whatever way that means and

0:33:54.160,0:34:04.420
however that turns out and I I don't

0:33:58.240,0:34:09.010
ever want to limit you like I love you

0:34:04.420,0:34:13.000
and all I want is for you to be happy

0:34:09.010,0:34:15.280
and to grow and to learn and and to be

0:34:13.000,0:34:20.560
able to witness those changes and and

0:34:15.280,0:34:24.190
growth and I I don't know what I would

0:34:20.560,0:34:26.409
do if I found out I was limiting you in

0:34:24.190,0:34:30.070
some way that I would just break my

0:34:26.409,0:34:32.560
heart so I I hope that I never do and I

0:34:30.070,0:34:36.390
hope that that the way that we are

0:34:32.560,0:34:39.990
together just continues to encourage

0:34:36.390,0:34:43.470
growth and change and

0:34:39.990,0:34:46.620
that can be limitless you know I'm not

0:34:43.470,0:34:51.750
I'm so not worried about your limiting

0:34:46.620,0:34:54.360
me in any way I mean what what what's

0:34:51.750,0:34:59.490
exciting for me and what I love also

0:34:54.360,0:35:01.700
about being with you is that I if

0:34:59.490,0:35:05.130
anything you're just going to encourage

0:35:01.700,0:35:07.080
more experiences for me yeah that idea

0:35:05.130,0:35:09.630
of settling down or that I'll be limited

0:35:07.080,0:35:10.980
because I'm with maybe it was a

0:35:09.630,0:35:19.350
different partner if it was someone else

0:35:10.980,0:35:22.170
who is more set and doesn't have an

0:35:19.350,0:35:24.630
interest in growth or expanding that

0:35:22.170,0:35:27.570
would be a different question you know

0:35:24.630,0:35:32.280
that age difference because it's with

0:35:27.570,0:35:37.280
you there's someone I think who is going

0:35:32.280,0:35:40.490
to pull the best out of me so if I I

0:35:37.280,0:35:42.720
know I'm not gonna miss out on anything

0:35:40.490,0:35:47.580
being with you it's gonna just help me

0:35:42.720,0:35:50.150
get more okay I'm glad you feel that way

0:35:47.580,0:35:50.150
yeah

0:35:54.300,0:36:00.030
looking back do you wish you'd proposed

0:35:57.010,0:36:00.030
why or why not

0:36:05.380,0:36:08.470
[Laughter]

0:36:08.970,0:36:16.810
I was because because you know as you

0:36:15.100,0:36:18.190
know you know our first discussion is

0:36:16.810,0:36:20.980
this idea we had these conversations

0:36:18.190,0:36:23.610
about the idea of marriage before and

0:36:20.980,0:36:28.840
you had expressed in so many terms that

0:36:23.610,0:36:33.180
not for you yeah marriage whatever some

0:36:28.840,0:36:37.540
bullshit patriarchy system that's good

0:36:33.180,0:36:39.880
but there's no need for it so I kind of

0:36:37.540,0:36:41.500
I think I resigned to the idea like okay

0:36:39.880,0:36:43.120
that's that's what that is

0:36:41.500,0:36:45.760
you know that's not something that's

0:36:43.120,0:36:51.300
necessary for me to have a relationship

0:36:45.760,0:36:57.820
with her so when you did propose to me

0:36:51.300,0:37:01.060
it's and make it had to make me it's

0:36:57.820,0:37:09.970
like it's gonna look that back-and-forth

0:37:01.060,0:37:11.650
almost like if I was I was up it was a

0:37:09.970,0:37:12.730
you know so in the moment as well so on

0:37:11.650,0:37:15.400
the moment of like a heightened

0:37:12.730,0:37:16.600
experience of like us being outs and you

0:37:15.400,0:37:18.550
know traveling and being with friends

0:37:16.600,0:37:20.160
and having a great time and then like

0:37:18.550,0:37:24.670
you said I want to marry you

0:37:20.160,0:37:27.510
that it almost was difficult to like

0:37:24.670,0:37:31.690
process it at once like is this for real

0:37:27.510,0:37:33.580
is this you know a sincere and truthful

0:37:31.690,0:37:34.120
moment right here and there you didn't

0:37:33.580,0:37:38.230
believe it

0:37:34.120,0:37:39.940
no I of course but you know you always

0:37:38.230,0:37:41.320
sincere about these things it's not like

0:37:39.940,0:37:45.040
you ever take those things back it's

0:37:41.320,0:37:48.280
just it was a low is hard to reconcile

0:37:45.040,0:37:51.520
with what I had thoughts your ideology

0:37:48.280,0:37:53.440
was before which is why I said yes but

0:37:51.520,0:37:56.650
let's I want to ask you again the next

0:37:53.440,0:38:02.110
day to make sure

0:37:56.650,0:38:04.810
I don't regret not being the one to

0:38:02.110,0:38:07.350
propose I like the fact that there's

0:38:04.810,0:38:11.890
this yeah and the role reversal of its I

0:38:07.350,0:38:13.750
enjoy that I don't know I'll be honest I

0:38:11.890,0:38:18.400
don't know if I would have asked myself

0:38:13.750,0:38:20.080
as soon as you asked me I think if I

0:38:18.400,0:38:21.430
were the one who's like oh you know the

0:38:20.080,0:38:23.440
guy I'm going to ask at some point it

0:38:21.430,0:38:25.510
probably would have been at a different

0:38:23.440,0:38:27.910
points and I've probably been more I

0:38:25.510,0:38:30.340
want to have been more of a thing to

0:38:27.910,0:38:32.040
some degree not like it would have been

0:38:30.340,0:38:35.410
more of a thing I just did a little bit

0:38:32.040,0:38:38.110
no no no need a no flash my house or

0:38:35.410,0:38:40.260
whatever nonsense no fancy restaurant

0:38:38.110,0:38:45.580
dinners okay it's like inside the

0:38:40.260,0:38:48.010
chocolate tarts are but I imagine I

0:38:45.580,0:38:52.090
would have been like ha you know how am

0:38:48.010,0:38:57.250
I gonna ask it and do I deal with a ring

0:38:52.090,0:39:01.600
I partner I think it would I would I

0:38:57.250,0:39:07.420
maybe I miss the fun of like dealing

0:39:01.600,0:39:09.130
with that I yeah that's kind of like all

0:39:07.420,0:39:12.460
my thoughts scattered around I hope that

0:39:09.130,0:39:15.340
answers it to some degree yeah okay what

0:39:12.460,0:39:17.530
about you do they feel happy that you

0:39:15.340,0:39:21.790
were the ones asked absolutely yeah I

0:39:17.530,0:39:24.400
honestly if you had asked I I don't I

0:39:21.790,0:39:30.520
don't know I because I would have felt

0:39:24.400,0:39:32.860
like you weren't you didn't trust my

0:39:30.520,0:39:34.750
feelings about marriage you know mm-hmm

0:39:32.860,0:39:36.550
you're like oh oh she'll just she'll

0:39:34.750,0:39:38.560
ventually come around so if I ask her

0:39:36.550,0:39:40.390
then she'll feel differently about

0:39:38.560,0:39:42.490
marriage well it would have been true

0:39:40.390,0:39:44.320
yes but I had to come to that

0:39:42.490,0:39:46.720
realization on my own I would have felt

0:39:44.320,0:39:48.130
like it was forced upon me by you

0:39:46.720,0:39:51.460
putting me on the spot like that

0:39:48.130,0:39:54.910
mm-hm I think I don't know who knows but

0:39:51.460,0:39:58.080
I I'm I'm really glad the way that the

0:39:54.910,0:39:58.080
way that it happened what's fair

0:40:00.550,0:40:06.440
okay and now I did not ask them I didn't

0:40:05.630,0:40:09.619

0:40:06.440,0:40:18.980

0:40:40.300,0:40:48.760
aside from your sense of fashion I think

0:40:53.710,0:41:11.019
I admire your your drive and your

0:41:05.039,0:41:15.190
determination to follow your vision to

0:41:11.019,0:41:17.980
follow what you think is right and what

0:41:15.190,0:41:21.309
needs to be done and and sometimes

0:41:17.980,0:41:24.670
that's in a human interaction and

0:41:21.309,0:41:27.609
sometimes that's in work and sometimes

0:41:24.670,0:41:32.529
that's in your creativity but whatever

0:41:27.609,0:41:35.890
it is you know what you want and you go

0:41:32.529,0:41:41.319
for it and you give it your all you know

0:41:35.890,0:41:44.170
but you do you when you're passionate

0:41:41.319,0:41:48.009
about something there's there's no

0:41:44.170,0:41:53.529
denying it you put your whole self into

0:41:48.009,0:41:56.279

0:42:10.550,0:42:21.210
by the person you decided you wanted to

0:42:16.080,0:42:28.170
be and how you made those choices to get

0:42:21.210,0:42:31.200
there that you knew what environment you

0:42:28.170,0:42:34.770
want to be so you move there yeah that

0:42:31.200,0:42:36.750
you you you you know left left your

0:42:34.770,0:42:37.800
space at a young age I'm gonna go

0:42:36.750,0:42:42.600
somewhere else and this is where I'm

0:42:37.800,0:42:45.210
gonna start my life and yeah from what I

0:42:42.600,0:42:50.300
know also from what you've told me that

0:42:45.210,0:42:54.660
you commit to those decisions that you

0:42:50.300,0:42:59.700
you you've seen the people around you

0:42:54.660,0:43:04.650
who make easier choices that you don't

0:42:59.700,0:43:06.930
make easy choices for yourself it's it's

0:43:04.650,0:43:10.350
very impressive I know you sometimes

0:43:06.930,0:43:14.070

you're still not a hundred percent you

0:43:14.070,0:43:17.760
haven't figured out life completely yet

0:43:15.930,0:43:23.040
it's somehow your responsibility that

0:43:17.760,0:43:25.860
you have to but I like that's you're

0:43:23.040,0:43:28.710
searching and that you're so eager for

0:43:25.860,0:43:31.860
