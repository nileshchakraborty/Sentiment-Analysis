just a really sweet thing like you

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,950
seemed eager and excited and present and

25
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:14,870
that standing up kind of represents all

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:19,790
of that not in like a you know m'lady

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,110
not in a m'lady sort of way just just

28
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,630
you know you I don't need you to hold

29
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,239
doors open or anything but I just like

30
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,100
that you're you know you don't that you

31
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,320
you stood up and that it seemed like you

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,310
were excited for me to join you at the

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,790
table and I like that yeah what about me

34
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,939
I remember your smile I mean just

35
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,069
you know because you're I'm sitting

36
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:44,840
there I'm waiting I'm trying to kind of

37
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,180
maybe look busy not always looking at

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,530
the door waiting for the person that

39
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,140
looks like the photo to walk in the

40
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,450
person I've been talking to and then

41
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,409
when you came in and so obviously so

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:01,400
clearly you and that was very exciting

43
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:03,680
because you matched up with the image I

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,680
had built up as well just just very

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,150
quickly and how you expressed yourself

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,260
you know just in the moment to the

47
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,959
presence of course I remember yes that

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,650
big smile yeah taking up 90% of your

49
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,470
face and I don't I didn't think it was a

50
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,599
conscious choice to stand up here just

51
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:28,069
like that's yeah of course like oh I'm

52
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:32,739
gonna walk closer and say hi I remember

53
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:32,739
you being really animated very energetic

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,319
maybe it's because of what that guy was

55
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:44,449
it like a cow the cacao candy thing

56
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:48,650
basically cocaine basically cocaine but

57
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:53,000
I didn't mean to yes yeah it was great

58
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:56,870
yeah so you know this was like a first

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,560
day thing so in a way and sometimes you

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,120
know as the talkative kind of person you

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,299
know I end up finding myself having to

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:11,590
lead conversations and having toys drive

63
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:16,280
that momentum and all any any sense of

64
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:18,859
you know like weights or you know it was

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,520
upcoming difficulty was just dissipated

66
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:24,380
like within 30 seconds yeah it felt like

67
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,460
we knew each other yeah that's nice

68
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,880
comfortable exactly yeah all right is

69
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,880
the next question

70
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:49,169
when do you feel closest to me in some

71
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:52,979
ways may be lazy mornings you know just

72
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:55,770
in that physical intimacy of that just

73
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:58,770
being able to lay together be very

74
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:07,080
comfortable be good yeah

75
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:12,389
nuzzle it up I know so after after good

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:15,059
sex after that that sense of you know

77
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:18,830
that we managed to really satisfy each

78
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:22,529
other and that we were connected and

79
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:26,689
that that emotional connection was there

80
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:30,209
as well and we can just kind of bask in

81
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:33,719
in our in our abilities and in our in

82
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:38,300
our at each other it's I feel very loved

83
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:42,149
and it's it's it's a very nice feeling

84
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:48,059
yeah well yeah I guess those moments we

85
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:50,839
are together in our own space yeah how

86
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:55,379
are you know I agree with you about sex

87
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:59,069
post-sex you know I just but I think

88
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:01,709
also when we're creating something

89
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,349
together when we're writing together and

90
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,789
it just feels really productive and I

91
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:07,529
say something and then you say something

92
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,360
and then I write something and then you

93
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,800
do something and and it just feels like

94
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,679
we're building off this momentum and I

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,800
just feel like it's such an obvious

96
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:19,169
closeness that we have that we can we

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,629
can bounce those things around really

98
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:24,719
quickly and and have something to show

99
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:33,569
for that just like I don't know shows

100
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:39,670
how close we are it's not a competition

101
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:44,880
well what are you hesitant

102
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:52,620
tell me has a tenth of Terra yeah yeah

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:55,870
Wow I I don't I don't know I feel like

104
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:00,010
we share everything you know I mean you

105
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:03,670
know about issues in my past and exes

106
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:05,590
and crushes and you know any a lot of

107
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,440
the things that couples are hesitant to

108
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,640
share or never do or you know my kinks

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,230
or my you know my annoyances and

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:20,280
grievances like those those are things

111
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:22,630
that we talk about constantly so I

112
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,220
really don't feel like I ever hesitate

113
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:28,770
to share anything with you probably

114
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:32,860
sometimes you wish I would maybe

115
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:35,620
hesitate a bit more sharing things but I

116
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,970
really you know I you know that I can't

117
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,490
as soon as something comes up I have to

118
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,060
tell you even if it's not at the right

119
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,800
time so there's no question you were

120
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,470
like oh I hope that's not a question

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,870
that eh yeah no you know and I've been

122
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,030
thinking about it the last couple days

123
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:57,370
and there hasn't been anything that I'm

124
00:07:52,030 --> 00:08:02,070
like oh god I really I feel like I am as

125
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,070
open as I can be with someone with you

126
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,400
yeah is there anything you're hesitant I

127
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,050
think anything that was a reluctance at

128
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,300
any point I've already shared with you

129
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:20,140
you know there were any parts that maybe

130
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,910
I was insecure about or oh you know I've

131
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,150
been really shared this part of myself

132
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:29,770
completely yet I definitely feel like I

133
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:32,620
have there are no it's sighs it's not

134
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:37,150
exciting right that's not I wish there

135
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:39,630
is like a little something I never told

136
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,630
you about it

137
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:53,800
yeah first unfortunate lack of the

138
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,800
excitement of it no yeah

139
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,520
[Laughter]

140
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,680
what was the last trip that connected us

141
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:17,450
and why the last trip that connected us

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:21,290
yeah and why I know we go on somewhat

143
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,940
each other we do or one of the the best

144
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,550
trip that I linked at us anyway what

145
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,720
comes to mind is Israel you know what

146
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,520
you asked that question something last

147
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,980
trip I by any means but yeah because you

148
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,510
know yeah I saw you visit you in

149
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,980
Istanbul then there's that time apart

150
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:44,060
and then relatively quickly it felt we

151
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,400
you know travel together to Israel to to

152
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,750
go to Jordan and all that and that was

153
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:54,050
you know intense weekend a bit of us

154
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,260
just traveling and figuring out each

155
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,490
other's rhythms no Wade you know known

156
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,220
each other for what like three months

157
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:09,160
pretty much yeah and most of its through

158
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,160
a computer screen yeah so you know you

159
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,080
think you saw me as me and I gonna see

160
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,570
you as you and I think it was exciting

161
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:23,720
to get our ideas of each other confirmed

162
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,760
to you know be pushed into a highly kind

163
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,800
of stressful situation but of course oh

164
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,230
so this was our earlier can I trip

165
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,070
together so maybe there was some aspect

166
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:38,690
or we got our best behavior or this that

167
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:41,420
but I'd like to think otherwise and you

168
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,200
know I I was there a bit longer and then

169
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,310
we talked while I was outside the museum

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,700
and we talked about what you're gonna be

171
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:53,650
doing next summer and whether you'd be

172
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:57,740
coming to the Netherlands or waiting so

173
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,000
it was highly kind of emotional and

174
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,430
exciting to

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,410
find out what that conclusion was going

176
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,580
to be and that you did decide to come

177
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:11,690
sooner than later I was maybe a bit

178
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,490
worried that you would feel like you

179
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,290
would we're going to miss out on one

180
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:21,680
thing that you really wanted instead of

181
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:23,090
the other thing but I think I like to

182
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,760
think the way the right choice said I'm

183
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:35,480
not really happy that you came he did so

184
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:38,060
yeah that really connected us I feel I I

185
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,860
was thinking the trip the latest trip

186
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:46,310
that connected us was best kept secret

187
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:48,590
the festival you know we had a little

188
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:52,030
road trip down there to the south and

189
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:54,290
then we worked on building this festival

190
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:58,160
together I just saw you had like some

191
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:01,100
manual labor and you know waking up

192
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,710
early and trekking to the site and then

193
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,070
your second all-time it was so sick but

194
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:09,890
we you know we push through and we met

195
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,690
people and and we were camping and not

196
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,990
really sleeping because it's a festival

197
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,970
I don't know what we were expecting but

198
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:21,200
you know actually literally sharing a

199
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:24,020
tiny tent and not the best weather and

200
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,610
but then we had those that moment when

201
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,960
the festival doors opened and we were

202
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,270
all like standing there together and

203
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,210
seeing what we had created or been part

204
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,380
of creating and then we got to actually

205
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,620
stay for the whole festival and

206
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,870
experience that music and Sunday morning

207
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,870
I think was it like really solidified

208
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,430
that connection for us for me you know

209
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,850
happy like lying there in the morning

210
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,980
and listening to agree with Jonny

211
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,050
Greenwood and the orchestra and it was

212
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,730
like raining and relying on the picnic

213
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,980
blanket and you know we're a little

214
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,020
hungover from the weekend but you're

215
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,050
holding hands and just like really in

216
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,000
that music really connected yeah and

217
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,450
then stumbling upon some other bands

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,700
before leaving tora tora and then

219
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,370
sitting on the beach across from the

220
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,110
festival before leaving just listening

221
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,360
to an echoing across the

222
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:23,300
as I was really great yeah I felt really

223
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:23,300
really connected to you yeah

224
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,720
what is the biggest challenge to our

225
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:39,320
relationship and how do you think we can

226
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:47,240
solve it biggest challenge I don't think

227
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:49,970
it's lack of communication but I think

228
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,980
it's sometimes finding the right way to

229
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:58,190
communicate what we need to communicate

230
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:59,660
I think that that just comes from being

231
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,680
different people alright coming from

232
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,870
different families and different

233
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,610
countries and and having and as similar

234
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,300
as we are in so many ways and even as

235
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:16,730
our families are you know the way that

236
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:19,160
you express yourself sometimes is it's

237
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,540
hard for me to interpret you know and

238
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,810
and but we're learning we're learning

239
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,180
how to figure that out as we go along

240
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,390
and I think we're both patient people

241
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,010
and will over communicate until we

242
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,500
figure out why we can't communicate and

243
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:37,730
then continue to communicate so I think

244
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,170
that that works for us you know wanting

245
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,900
to communicate and wanting to figure out

246
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,700
exactly why why is there confusion here

247
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,450
why aren't we understanding one another

248
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,250
and figuring out so we're we're we're

249
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,550
working on it I mean I've been I've been

250
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,860
and really just before we're talking too

251
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,310
much was actually the problem I mean in

252
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,610
some ways because they've just become

253
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,230
this cycle of trying to talk about the

254
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,610
issue and talking about that issue which

255
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,690
cause another issue which got another I

256
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,970
should not obviously those weren't

257
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,630
didn't create a healthy relationship I

258
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,730
mean is that a worry you would ever have

259
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:16,550
that would over communicate things no

260
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:22,160
I'm I'm not worried about that because I

261
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:26,000
think that we both like like to have a

262
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,310
conclusion you know we like it to to get

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
somewhere and so I don't think we leave

264
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,110
things open ended you know you know you

265
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,610
don't like to go to bed without solving

266
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,500
whatever issues at hand

267
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:40,010
and I think that's a good way to be and

268
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:42,110
I think we kind of do that regardless of

269
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,720
it's nighttime or daytime you know

270
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,000
wherever we are we want to make sure we

271
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,070
resolve whatever the thing it is we need

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,920
to talk about and usually we do so

273
00:15:49,070 --> 00:16:00,260
pretty quickly because yeah we listen to

274
00:15:51,920 --> 00:16:03,470
each other and we figure it out oh you

275
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:13,029
want me to yeah why not the biggest

276
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:15,260
challenge in our relationship um I think

277
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:18,579
that yeah well you talk about one aspect

278
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:23,680
I think for some ways we're going to

279
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:29,269
we're gonna have to figure out how we

280
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,730
balance our you know ambitions as they

281
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:34,190
relate to you know creativity to our

282
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,100
careers to you know how we want to

283
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:40,670
survive as as people and how that

284
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,010
connects into our relationship and you

285
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,750
know that that level of partnership as

286
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,070
well you know you talked about the

287
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,680
intimacy you feel when we work together

288
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,860
and I feel - so that's a very exciting

289
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,480
thing but I I suspect maybe I'm just

290
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,160
seeing about being anxious but I suspect

291
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,029
that the owners gonna be challenges

292
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,680
facing that as well and you know as we

293
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,980
try and find our place more yeah we're

294
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,010
still kind of both searching a bit so I

295
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,120
think part of that challenge which

296
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,790
doesn't seem insurmountable seems like

297
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,309
something we can definitely handle is

298
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,549
how how are we gonna move forward

299
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:19,790
together how are we gonna collectively

300
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:21,579
find go towards our ambitions and that's

301
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,319
it's it's an exciting challenge in a way

302
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,370
that's it's fun to think that that is

303
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,929
probably the biggest thing we're gonna

304
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:32,350
have to deal with yeah yeah it's a biter

305
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,350
yeah

306
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:43,400
when was the last time I disappointed

307
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,400
you and how do you feel about it now

308
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:54,240
that's actually at the at the Film

309
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,830
Festival at the blik - nothing

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,230
yes yeah I mean that's the last thing I

311
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:01,260
can think about the last time you know I

312
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,900
was minor relative and minor we had to

313
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,730
do this kind of thing just you know and

314
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,830
together with all the other people

315
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,020
sitting in the theater sitting outside

316
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:14,730
the theater and I think they asked a

317
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:19,260
question if yeah if you were - how would

318
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:22,260
you seduce me and in my mind was like

319
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,570
okay so yeah how would I say this er

320
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,100
just like as we are and then you said

321
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,800
something and then I misinterpreted it

322
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,480
as say like we don't know each other and

323
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,190
then I'd you know you know yeah I

324
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,860
attempted to do then that thing and then

325
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,510
I felt like I put myself like okay I'm

326
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,809
gonna pretend she's someone I don't know

327
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:43,230
ish and I'm gonna do whatever ability to

328
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:45,090
flirt that I have and then I felt at the

329
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,740
time you guys shut it down because it

330
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:52,730
wasn't what the actual assignment was so

331
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,170
what disappointed me was that I I felt

332
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,330
yeah I felt like you know I'm like

333
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:05,610
almost as if I'm at like asking a girl

334
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:07,620
out to be like Roy and it bummed me out

335
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,240
but and then we got like into like a

336
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,590
little argument right there in the

337
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,120
moment which felt like it too obvious

338
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:19,559
which frustrated me as well like oh

339
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,030
great they got to us already yeah that's

340
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,860
before we signed up for this thing and

341
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:27,660
but we talked about it right then and

342
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:29,190
there and you know he said you're sorry

343
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,740
and then I explained what I was going on

344
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:35,480
my hands and then we and we worked it

345
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,480
out so that's it

346
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:55,070
after all that gold you ever see her

347
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,070
yeah

348
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:06,960
one two test test

349
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:08,549
seduction sex yeah so we talked about it

350
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,400
we talked it through it was you know

351
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:14,280
obviously a minor thing but uh I guess I

352
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,460
just felt vulnerable so you felt

353
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,559
disappointed though me yeah I was

354
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,630
disappointed that I was disappointed

355
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:24,210
that I couldn't just you know play that

356
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:29,299
game and disappointed that you work in a

357
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:34,320
responds and I guess I'll wait it out

358
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:36,419
smashing noise I guess that's

359
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,210
disappointed also yeah like disappointed

360
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:41,400
in I didn't it didn't work I didn't -

361
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:45,470
this year and my so far with you in the

362
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:53,340
way that I hoped I would okay yeah yeah

363
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:54,929
how about you disappointed me that time

364
00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:03,210
you didn't bring the picnic blanket you

365
00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:05,760
know now uh disappointed me I'm s that's

366
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,960
pretty strong you know for me hmm if

367
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,110
someone disappoints me you know it's

368
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,610
like it's like when I'm not that I'm

369
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,289
comparing this to being a mother but you

370
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,900
know what I mean like when a mom is

371
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,370
disappointed that's like the worst thing

372
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,230
right it's a nursing degree

373
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,130
yeah we're not disappointed right yeah

374
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,990
so to me that's that's like stronger

375
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,730
it's more serious than like being

376
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,370
frustrated or being angry being

377
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,350
disappointed is like yeah letting

378
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,200
someone down and you know that that's

379
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,960
like the that's the hardest thing for me

380
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,710
it's like let myself roll let people

381
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,710
down so

382
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:52,500
you you disappointed me yeah now that

383
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:58,470
you've explained how serious honestly I

384
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:02,309
can't think of okay when you came to

385
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:04,740
Istanbul to visit and I felt like you

386
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,210
know you I had to work the day that you

387
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,570
arrived and you're flying all the way

388
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,460
from Amsterdam and it was the first time

389
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,470
we'd be seeing each other after meeting

390
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:19,049
here and then me going back home to

391
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:20,070
Istanbul and you weren't sure what you

392
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:21,720
were going to do the whole first day

393
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,980
because there'd be no way for me to let

394
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,590
you into my apartment you wouldn't know

395
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,610
where it was and I had to work until

396
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:33,419
like 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. so I created this

397
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:35,700
whole plan for you so you would have

398
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,250
like interesting things to see in places

399
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:42,419
to go and you wouldn't feel so lost in

400
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:43,860
such a city of chaos and I made this old

401
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:46,289
book and I talked to all these different

402
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,880
cafes and I I planned like different

403
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:49,710
routes for you and like different games

404
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,130
for you to play and I drew photos and I

405
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,690
drew a map and and then you showed up

406
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,520
and you're like oh my friends picking me

407
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,149
up so I'll see you later and I'm gonna

408
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,510
stay with him for the first couple days

409
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:06,899
and that like really really disappointed

410
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,490
me because I felt like I was so excited

411
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:12,990
to see you and I put so much effort into

412
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:15,779
yeah you know like a high school project

413
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,159
you know but I like I really put on my

414
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,570
heart into this and then you're just

415
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,070
like yeah yeah my friends picking me up

416
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,720
I'm gonna go stay in this like fancy

417
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:29,399
area of the city I'll see you in a

418
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:31,080
couple days yeah okay I don't think I

419
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:34,730
stayed there a couple days really

420
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,730
that's two days the first two days

421
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,650
[Laughter]

422
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:55,660
what is something I could have done to

423
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:58,320
support you during the abortion I think

424
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:04,740
I think he did a pretty good job

425
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:07,300
supporting me I think it would have been

426
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,880
you know I was I was mostly nervous

427
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,670
about interacting with the doctors that

428
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,820
would that was my biggest concern you

429
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:18,370
know of course I honestly it wasn't as

430
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,490
emotional about making that big choice

431
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,860
as I think it is for a lot of people it

432
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,870
wasn't as hard for me I knew the choice

433
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,300
that I wanted to make and that probably

434
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:31,600
was best for us as well obviously it was

435
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:35,800
best for us but yeah I knew that I

436
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:40,240
wanted to have an abortion so that

437
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:44,010
wasn't a big decision but for going to

438
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,540
the intake appointment by myself and

439
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,940
then having to make the decision do I

440
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:53,110
take the pill or you know do I come back

441
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,940
and have a surgery and am I fully under

442
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,190
or do I just do it with like local

443
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,870
anesthesia you know like what and -

444
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,880
making these choices that was really

445
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:04,150
hard for me and having that doctor who

446
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,890
wasn't very nice and you know that that

447
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:10,570
makes me like really emotional

448
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,820
more so vivid than anything else feeling

449
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,970
vulnerable already and then being by

450
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:20,320
myself and not having that support I

451
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:22,510
know you had to work but it was it was

452
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,090
hard and then what you weren't there or

453
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,250
something oh your friends were in town

454
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:29,170
that was the week before yeah your

455
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,750
friends were in town but I still like I

456
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,180
went and got tested to make sure that I

457
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,890
was they did the ultrasound to make sure

458
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,390
I was actually pregnant okay they're in

459
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,780
the same time this day your friends

460
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:43,780
arrived and you you wanted me to no no

461
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,090
no I do the pregnancy I took the

462
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,650
pregnancy test yeah

463
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,290
and then they were arriving like an

464
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:52,060
authority but the moment that your best

465
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,860
friends were arriving into town and you

466
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,380
kind of had encouraged me to take it and

467
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,810
then you went and hung out with them and

468
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:04,180
I was by myself at home like taking this

469
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:07,030
pregnancy test and I just felt like you

470
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:10,540
know maybe didn't realize like how how

471
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:13,120
emotional that would be yeah I remember

472
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,070
that conversation I mean I understand I

473
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,610
understand why you felt that I was

474
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,710
encouraging it at the time I thought

475
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,350
about this obviously recently and what

476
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,750
would have had been if you had waited a

477
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,460
few days and then taking it like you

478
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,220
know schrödinger's pregnancy or

479
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:34,270
something like what would have it

480
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,840
changed the dynamic wise I just remember

481
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:39,670
being on the phone with you and you

482
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,640
saying that you got the you got the test

483
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:44,200
or something and what I recall I said

484
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,480
like you know if you want to decide to

485
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,990
take it now that's sure if not that's

486
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,390
okay too

487
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,100
your probably sensed because you know me

488
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:54,610
that I like knowing things right away so

489
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,440
you felt that encouragement I think you

490
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,290
said I would rather you take the

491
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,820
pregnancy test now

492
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,130
why would why would we need to wait and

493
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,980
for me it was a matter of whether I'm

494
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,420
pregnant or not it is what it is at

495
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,120
least we can wait a couple days until

496
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,530
your friends leave your best friends

497
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,620
that you haven't seen in years yeah and

498
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,850
and you were kind of like let's just

499
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,310
let's just figure it out now let's just

500
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,920
know and that is one big difference

501
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,570
between you rather just like no now no

502
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,120
matter what and me it's like well it is

503
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:27,010
what it is let's just like wait wait to

504
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:33,820
open the box sure neighbor's cat or

505
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:35,230
whatever but okay but I think yeah just

506
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,020
just being a little more present and

507
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,590
then you did end up staying the next day

508
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,970
with me after the day I had the abortion

509
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,920
you stayed with me but then the next day

510
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,450
you were kind of just you were gonna go

511
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,800
do something else with some friends

512
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,380
you're gonna meet up with friends and

513
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,320
you go you're okay and I told you like

514
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,210
I'm not okay like I know that I seem

515
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,940
okay but I need your hair and you didn't

516
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,120
you stayed

517
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,100
so that you didn't provide the support

518
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,900
that I needed yeah because it was hard

519
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,270
to read sometimes exactly what you're

520
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,720
you know because yeah like you said it

521
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:11,930
wasn't it didn't have the stereotypical

522
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,510
kind of emotional white that you know

523
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,640
like whoa well one sided are we playing

524
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,290
every like making not to make it too

525
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,090
much of a big deal are we gonna push the

526
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,940
side it's like oh you know this is what

527
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:28,610
it is we'll move on or like oh my god

528
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:32,840
let's individual yeah so trying to find

529
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:35,630
that balance yeah that I think you know

530
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,670

very supportive and and present one shot

537
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,150
once I let you know that I needed you to

538
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,150

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,800
just we're in a committed relationship

545
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,440
yeah it's it's we're there we've

546
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,520
committed we we talked about the future

547
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:36,960
we imagined it we fantasize about the

548
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,940
possibilities and I you know probably

549
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,640
for longer than it was concrete for us

550
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:45,330
both knowing for sure I was always just

551
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,840
considering how things would be down the

552
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:50,430
line and whatever I imagined myself in

553
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,010
the future I always imagined it together

554
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:56,280
with you and I

555
00:29:53,010 --> 00:30:01,680

556
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:05,960

comforting and nice feeling and that's

560
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,550

in store plenty of cats I mean I'm not

594
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,050
worried about that but whatever is in

595
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:21,300
store for us and we still have that

596
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:23,900
forever love that connection so will

597
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,200

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,200
forever love

599
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:42,220
what do you think I'm missing out by

600
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:49,260
being with you well I mean you're you're

601
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:51,610
younger than me you're 25 yes yes I am

602
00:32:49,260 --> 00:33:03,610
age doesn't matter it's just a number

603
00:32:51,610 --> 00:33:07,060
right 17 you're 25 and I'm 29 and I I

604
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:10,690
feel like I've lived 10 lives you know I

605
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,940
feel so lucky to have been able to live

606
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,960
in so many places and do so many things

607
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:19,600
and and have adventures and meet amazing

608
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,500
people and things I know you've done as

609
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,790
well but I feel like I've had more

610
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,390
opportunities to do so just because I'm

611
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:30,520
older and you know sometimes I find

612
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,070
myself saying when I was your age and I

613
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,690
don't mean it in that like I'm older

614
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,730
sort of way but like I'm like oh yeah

615
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,760
when I was 25 I was living in Istanbul I

616
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:44,610
was doing this I was Anna and I feel

617
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:51,130
like sometimes being with me and

618
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:54,160
settling down is somehow might limit you

619
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:58,240
and in whatever way that means and

620
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:04,420
however that turns out and I I don't

621
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:09,010
ever want to limit you like I love you

622
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:13,000
and all I want is for you to be happy

623
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:15,280
and to grow and to learn and and to be

624
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,560
able to witness those changes and and

625
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:24,190
growth and I I don't know what I would

626
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,409
do if I found out I was limiting you in

627
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:30,070
some way that I would just break my

628
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:32,560
heart so I I hope that I never do and I

629
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:36,390
hope that that the way that we are

630
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,990
together just continues to encourage

631
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:43,470
growth and change and

632
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:46,620
that can be limitless you know I'm not

633
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:51,750
I'm so not worried about your limiting

634
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:54,360
me in any way I mean what what what's

635
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:59,490
exciting for me and what I love also

636
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:01,700
about being with you is that I if

637
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:05,130
anything you're just going to encourage

638
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,080
more experiences for me yeah that idea

639
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,630
of settling down or that I'll be limited

640
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,980
because I'm with maybe it was a

641
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:19,350
different partner if it was someone else

642
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:22,170
who is more set and doesn't have an

643
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,630
interest in growth or expanding that

644
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,570
would be a different question you know

645
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:32,280
that age difference because it's with

646
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:37,280
you there's someone I think who is going

647
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:40,490
to pull the best out of me so if I I

648
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,720
know I'm not gonna miss out on anything

649
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:47,580
being with you it's gonna just help me

650
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:50,150
get more okay I'm glad you feel that way

651
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,150
yeah

652
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:00,030
looking back do you wish you'd proposed

653
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,030
why or why not

654
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,470
[Laughter]

655
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:16,810
I was because because you know as you

656
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,190
know you know our first discussion is

657
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,980
this idea we had these conversations

658
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,610
about the idea of marriage before and

659
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:28,840
you had expressed in so many terms that

660
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:33,180
not for you yeah marriage whatever some

661
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:37,540
bullshit patriarchy system that's good

662
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,880
but there's no need for it so I kind of

663
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,500
I think I resigned to the idea like okay

664
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,120
that's that's what that is

665
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,760
you know that's not something that's

666
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:51,300
necessary for me to have a relationship

667
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:57,820
with her so when you did propose to me

668
00:36:51,300 --> 00:37:01,060
it's and make it had to make me it's

669
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:09,970
like it's gonna look that back-and-forth

670
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:11,650
almost like if I was I was up it was a

671
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,730
you know so in the moment as well so on

672
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,400
the moment of like a heightened

673
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,600
experience of like us being outs and you

674
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,550
know traveling and being with friends

675
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,160
and having a great time and then like

676
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:24,670
you said I want to marry you

677
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,510
that it almost was difficult to like

678
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:31,690
process it at once like is this for real

679
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:33,580
is this you know a sincere and truthful

680
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,120
moment right here and there you didn't

681
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,230
believe it

682
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,940
no I of course but you know you always

683
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,320
sincere about these things it's not like

684
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,040
you ever take those things back it's

685
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:48,280
just it was a low is hard to reconcile

686
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,520
with what I had thoughts your ideology

687
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,440
was before which is why I said yes but

688
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,650
let's I want to ask you again the next

689
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:02,110
day to make sure

690
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:04,810
I don't regret not being the one to

691
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:07,350
propose I like the fact that there's

692
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:11,890
this yeah and the role reversal of its I

693
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:13,750
enjoy that I don't know I'll be honest I

694
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:18,400
don't know if I would have asked myself

695
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:20,080
as soon as you asked me I think if I

696
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,430
were the one who's like oh you know the

697
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,440
guy I'm going to ask at some point it

698
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,510
probably would have been at a different

699
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,910
points and I've probably been more I

700
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:30,340
want to have been more of a thing to

701
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,040
some degree not like it would have been

702
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,410
more of a thing I just did a little bit

703
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,110
no no no need a no flash my house or

704
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,260
whatever nonsense no fancy restaurant

705
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:45,580
dinners okay it's like inside the

706
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:48,010
chocolate tarts are but I imagine I

707
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:52,090
would have been like ha you know how am

708
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:57,250
I gonna ask it and do I deal with a ring

709
00:38:52,090 --> 00:39:01,600
I partner I think it would I would I

710
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:07,420
maybe I miss the fun of like dealing

711
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:09,130
with that I yeah that's kind of like all

712
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,460
my thoughts scattered around I hope that

713
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,340
answers it to some degree yeah okay what

714
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,530
about you do they feel happy that you

715
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:21,790
were the ones asked absolutely yeah I

716
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:24,400
honestly if you had asked I I don't I

717
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:30,520
don't know I because I would have felt

718
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:32,860
like you weren't you didn't trust my

719
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,750
feelings about marriage you know mm-hmm

720
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,550
you're like oh oh she'll just she'll

721
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,560
ventually come around so if I ask her

722
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,390
then she'll feel differently about

723
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,490
marriage well it would have been true

724
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,320
yes but I had to come to that

725
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,720
realization on my own I would have felt

726
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,130
like it was forced upon me by you

727
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,460
putting me on the spot like that

728
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:54,910
mm-hm I think I don't know who knows but

729
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:58,080
I I'm I'm really glad the way that the

730
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,080
way that it happened what's fair

731
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:06,440
okay and now I did not ask them I didn't

732
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:09,619

733
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:18,980
what do you admire most about me are you

734
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:23,960

735
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:31,760
what do I admire most about you there

736
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:40,300
are so many things don't worry we don't

737
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:48,760
have that time ya know but doing my most

738
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:48,760
aside from your sense of fashion I think

739
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:11,019
I admire your your drive and your

740
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:15,190
determination to follow your vision to

741
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:17,980
follow what you think is right and what

742
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:21,309
needs to be done and and sometimes

743
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:24,670
that's in a human interaction and

744
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:27,609
sometimes that's in work and sometimes

745
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:32,529
that's in your creativity but whatever

746
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:35,890
it is you know what you want and you go

747
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:41,319
for it and you give it your all you know

748
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:44,170
but you do you when you're passionate

749
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:48,009
about something there's there's no

750
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:53,529
denying it you put your whole self into

751
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:56,279
it and I I love that about you I really

752
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:56,279
it's inspiring

753
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:16,080
i-i-i was and i remain just rain pressed

754
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:21,210
by the person you decided you wanted to

755
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:28,170
be and how you made those choices to get

756
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:31,200
there that you knew what environment you

757
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:34,770
want to be so you move there yeah that

758
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,750
you you you you know left left your

759
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,800
space at a young age I'm gonna go

760
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:42,600
somewhere else and this is where I'm

761
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:45,210
gonna start my life and yeah from what I

762
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:50,300
know also from what you've told me that

763
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:54,660
you commit to those decisions that you

764
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:59,700
you you've seen the people around you

765
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:04,650
who make easier choices that you don't

766
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:06,930
make easy choices for yourself it's it's

767
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:10,350
very impressive I know you sometimes

768
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:14,070
feel you know so has the older one that

769
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:15,930
you're still not a hundred percent you

770
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,760
haven't figured out life completely yet

771
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:23,040
it's somehow your responsibility that

772
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:25,860
you have to but I like that's you're

773
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,710
searching and that you're so eager for

774
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,860
discovery and adventure and that you

775
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:36,720

776
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:39,600
try new things and to that your game or

781
00:43:50,400 --> 00:44:01,310
