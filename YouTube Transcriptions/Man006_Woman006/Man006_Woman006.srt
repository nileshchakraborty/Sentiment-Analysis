1
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,489
all right let's see what we've got what

2
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,730
do you remember from the first time we

3
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:46,250
met the first time we met was at my

4
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,540
college at least and I was setting up

5
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:54,780
chairs and I think he thought I was a

6
00:00:48,540 --> 00:01:00,120
janitor I was wearing sweat pants and

7
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,780
was not prepared to set up your life

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:08,700
presence out of my life or meet you and

9
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:13,200
I wasn't really interested in meeting

10
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,060
anyone and kind of just went from there

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,430
all I really remember was talking about

12
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,000
Taylor Swift and talking about how guys

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,240
love when the bass drops in that song

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,850
that sounded like the goats I knew you

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
were trouble yeah that's really all I

16
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,460
remember from the first time that we

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,200
read I remember the next time we met a

18
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,880
little bit better heard a real first

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,719
song that I talked about but a good

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,009
first impression

21
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,039
okay first impression what do you

22
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,899
remember about the first time we met I

23
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,700
think probably about the same as you I

24
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,749
mean I didn't I certainly don't think

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,369
either of us wanted to have any

26
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:53,490
expectation of meeting somebody you

27
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,229
liked in a romantic way but I remember

28
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,119
being happy I was there because there

29
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,420
was a blizzard outside nothing one shows

30
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,560
to happen and this meeting I'm talking

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,090
to you before the show I thought you're

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,170
cool but I kind of dismissed it as like

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,020
well that's something that I'm not going

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,270
to meet again don't use nice I think

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,580
that's the truth you know I don't think

36
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,060
they either of us really thought we

37
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,720
would encounter each other all this all

38
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,720
this business

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:33,530
okay list your top three memories we've

40
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:36,800
had together well I mean I would say

41
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,950
probably the obvious one is us getting

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,260
engaged but I want to work I would say

43
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,840
the first would be spending that whole

44
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,640
first weekend together the week after we

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,650
met because that was kind of where it

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,390
went from like oh here's this person I

47
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,730
was I didn't think I was gonna be ever

48
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,530
again - all of a sudden now we're

49
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,840
hanging out we have this chemistry and

50
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,430
this is really exciting but I think even

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,500
leaving that weekend neither of us

52
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,520
really knew what was going to happen but

53
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,989
it was the first time in a long time

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,350
that I was like really excited about

55
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:12,380
something I think well the third one is

56
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:16,370
the engagement which I'll get to I think

57
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,250
number two is probably it's probably

58
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,170
gonna grafting with you the first summer

59
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,459
we were together when we I had never

60
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,160
gone away water rafting I was very

61
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,920
nervous about that yeah very very

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,390
nervous I had all sorts of visions of me

63
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,380
getting my head against a rocket and

64
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,850
that being the end of it but that was

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,320
one of those times where I just felt

66
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,790
like we've been a that's like maybe like

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,230
three or four months at that point and

68
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,930
then

69
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,950
that was the first time that I realized

70
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:48,580
how much fun I had with you all the time

71
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,640
and also how adept a ten year old kid is

72
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,769
at setting up the tents conveyances

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,470
leaving a basically flat intent for the

74
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,959
first night but the third the third and

75
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,330
most important one is definitely us

76
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,160
getting engaged because I thought the

77
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,870
weirdest part to me still is that I

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,430
thought you knew what was coming because

79
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,870
we had talked about like what kind of

80
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,879
ring do you want like this is something

81
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,180
that's somewhat imminent and might

82
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,829
happen and then when we're going up to

83
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,889
your parents house that morning and you

84
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:20,410
specifically said offhandedly like don't

85
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,300
ever surprise me with the proposal

86
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,010
because I was making fun of you for

87
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,240
always watching the end of reality shows

88
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,930
before you watch the beginning because

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,090
you don't get to attach the characters

90
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,250
that I kind of threw me up and then the

91
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,560
longest day that I've ever experienced

92
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,090
continued where it was ten hours of me

93
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,000
literally not listening to anything you

94
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,639
were saying but the fact that it took me

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,770
taking a ring out and your entire family

96
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,710
knowing what's going on before you

97
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,440
realized and then you swearing in front

98
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:55,150
of your grandmother I don't know if I

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,900
can swear here but it was great all

100
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,090
right

101
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,130
you could swear by the way okay well in

102
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,470
that case she said holy fuck in front of

103
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,690
her 86 year old grandmother was

104
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,740
phenomenal I don't think you a bad news

105
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,740
[Music]

106
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,320
all right well this how that goes right

107
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,580
into that why did you want to marry me

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,510
there are a lot of reasons I wanted to

109
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,610
marry you I think that one of the main

110
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,590
reasons that I wanted to marry you and

111
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,040
still want to marry or because we get

112
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,650
along so seamlessly I think that when we

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,980
talk about it and when people ask us you

114
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,870
know what you argue about it or what you

115
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,610
know what do you guys talk about theater

116
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,190
why do you guys get along or really just

117
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,900
any of those reasons there are so many

118
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,190
things and so many reasons that we

119
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,480
shouldn't be together it's so many

120
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,270
things that shouldn't have brought us

121
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,070
together and so many things that like

122
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,840
should have happened to push us apart

123
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,360
yeah it'll be the long distance for a

124
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,030
year and a half and I was still in

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,450
college I mean that and we could have

126
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,900
broken up so many times in there and

127
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:10,410
thanks for really hard for so long but

128
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,900
like through all of that time and not to

129
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,370
say that things weren't hard and like

130
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,290
there were probably times that we both

131
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,140
questions whether or not we're making

132
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,210
the right decision but like through all

133
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,980
of that and just seems so clear at the

134
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,490
end of it that you're the person that I

135
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,670
was supposed to be with it and it was

136
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,530
crazy because moving down to New York

137
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,390
didn't even seem like a big deal like

138
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,590
moving from me into New York it was like

139
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,230
no big deal

140
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,030
moving in together

141
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,980
I mean it's so minted leading up to it

142
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,419
but actually once we once that happen

143
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,820
you know yeah but now that we live

144
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,560
together it's like no big deal well it

145
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,240
was like we move in together and nothing

146
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,979
changed right I didn't even notice it

147
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:56,280
almost right well no but I think I feel

148
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:59,190
like the only struggles we ever had were

149
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,590
due to outside factors like any time

150
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:06,360
yeah you and I being together was always

151
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:07,710
really easy yeah I also think that the

152
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,450
fact that we just wanted to seed a

153
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,340
little more and didn't have the ability

154
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,560
to I think so makes us appreciate each

155
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,090
other more now and I think of whatever

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,950
if we had just started dating and we

157
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,630
lived in the same city and moved in

158
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,880
after two months of some people did I

159
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,620
also I think that right from the

160
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,800
beginning one of the biggest things

161
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,710
about you is I've had such an inherent

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,960
level of trust in you I've never ever

163
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,100
damaged you like ever I have always

164
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,380
known that no matter what I could always

165
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,380
know that you've had my back

166
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,000
like most people and long-distance

167
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,760
relationships would not be able to be

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,520
like oh yeah well that's my boyfriend

169
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,470
this median through Charles around to

170
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,370
different colleges where he also met me

171
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,979
College Sutan where he also met me at a

172
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,870
party you know and all of a sudden like

173
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,700
how are you supposed to trust him like

174
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,410
that but just it was almost unspoken

175
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,599
that we just inherently trusted each

176
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,880
other and having that right from the

177
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,229
beginning was so important I think both

178
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:13,260
of us growing together and obviously you

179
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:16,380
know that's core and communication is

180
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,440
cooler listening his car yeah anytime

181
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:23,389
your long-distance and you if you don't

182
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,389
have trust in that situation you're done

183
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,669
that's what I wanna marry you

184
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:39,700
how do you describe me to others I don't

185
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,630
know that it comes up that much I feel

186
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,670
like that's a weird thing to say but

187
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:48,490
like in that direct of a form it like I

188
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,050
guess I'm thinking of how well when I

189
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,339
first described you to my parents

190
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,339
let's start with that because I think

191
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,399
because of the fact that there was the

192
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,440
age difference and not even that eight

193
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,310
times but four and a half years which is

194
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,570
not a big deal

195
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,649
in the grand scheme of things but the

196
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,570
fact that you were at college at the

197
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,029
time I think when I would describe you

198
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,740
of people especially early on it would

199
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,510
be me having to like justify it and

200
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,850
probably you to the same extent of like

201
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,310
are you dating this touring example

202
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,230
meaningful lives in New York but when I

203
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,910
told my parents that I the you and I

204
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,760
were dating and that you were still in

205
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,390
college I think they immediately judged

206
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,579
well what kind of person you were which

207
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,440
I understand because a lot of 21 year

208
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:31,029
old college girls are not the most

209
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,680
mature people in the world I don't think

210
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,440
a lot of people in college are but the

211
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,140
thing I was stressed was that it never I

212
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,350
heard I had to remind myself and I self

213
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,110
remind remind yourself how young you are

214
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,240
relatively because I've never gotten

215
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,829
that vibe from you like I feel like in a

216
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,839
lot of ways you're a lot more mature

217
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:53,230
than I am a lot more mature than a lot

218
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,899
of people in their 40s and that's either

219
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,790
your personality or just a combination

220
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,070
your personality and the fact that

221
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,550
you've had to kind of be the adult a lot

222
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,440
of situations with your family and stuff

223
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,370
growing up and that

224
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
and I feel like you've always had to

225
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,639
take a lot of responsibility and

226
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,649
therefore you didn't have the luxury of

227
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:15,300
like goofing around but yeah I mean I

228
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,009
think that was kind of the way I

229
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,899
conveyed to my parents to let them know

230
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,680
like I'm not something like creep and

231
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:25,139
she's not so maybe it and what I told

232
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,550
them well I told my friends about you it

233
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:31,379
was just I think the thing that I said

234
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,110
that most often was that it just like it

235
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:37,079
felt different and I hadn't felt that

236
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,050
way about anybody in a long time and

237
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,990
then and then ever you know maybe like

238
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,449
as things progressed it was clear to me

239
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,860
that what you and I had going out was

240
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:48,600
something that I hadn't had with anybody

241
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,060
else and I think you always are

242
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,069
comparing it a relationship to whatever

243
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,410
the best relationship you think you had

244
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,850
in the past was and then all of sudden

245
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,110
that surpasses it and you're like oh I

246
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,139
guess I don't have to be hung up on that

247
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,779
anymore so yeah I think just as somebody

248
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:15,959
who's kind didn't mature and someone who

249
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:18,720
I have what is similar and different so

250
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:21,180
similar I definitely say that in a lot

251
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,759
of ways were on you know the same

252
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,130
wavelength when it comes to you know

253
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,889
what we care about how we sort of like

254
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,040
approach life like pretty even-keeled

255
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:34,860
people you know don't like to go out too

256
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,920
much which I also like value you

257
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,040
obviously got a 92 but that's certainly

258
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,199
a job but you know I think that we have

259
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,769
the same approach to a lot of different

260
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:48,750
issues and you know we don't we're just

261
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:53,550
kind of calm people I like that about us

262
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:56,699
I don't really know how I mean I don't

263
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,189
know how we're different that's probably

264
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,980
something I should well I mean not

265
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:01,900
necessarily

266
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,650
we certainly are a lot more similar than

267
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,420
we are different obviously our lives are

268
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,670
incredibly different but yeah well

269
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:18,760
that's kind of like the biggest thing I

270
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:23,140
mean obviously I work all day so that

271
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:25,000
would probably be a person I mean that's

272
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,460
the thing because it's one thing to tell

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,850
people like why you're interested in

274
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,740
somebody but the first time you you see

275
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,870
something with that person I think tells

276
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,580
you a lot and to me I've always had a

277
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,290
good feel for that like when I see my

278
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,700
friends with the new grill of their date

279
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,530
like whether or not it's probably going

280
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,530
to work out and I think when people saw

281
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,910
us together that was the comment that we

282
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,990
got more than anything else was like it

283
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,850
seems like you two were just like locked

284
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,060
in in terms of just being on the same

285
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:56,440
wavelength in terms of not not only like

286
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,120
sense of humor and personality but just

287
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,950
basically had a person I am the fact

288
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,170
that I'm sarcastic and I like to make

289
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,220
references to obscure things a lot of

290
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,290
people were their friends their

291
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,730
girlfriends or anybody felt kind of

292
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,110
alone for the rock that we know that

293
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,600
I'll talk about but I feel like you and

294
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,330
I both kind of bounce off each other and

295
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,120
I mean we are kind of like a comedy duo

296
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:22,780
amongst our friends in a way of just

297
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:25,420
like something that we can work towards

298
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:29,590
yeah I think about Stephanie a big

299
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,160
differences you know the day job paint

300
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,360
job

301
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,890
well and also what like I think here's

302
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,420
somebody who and obviously we've talked

303
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,990
about it before like you're much more

304
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:44,140
oriented towards small town than a city

305
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,720
house over the park of the yard or not a

306
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:50,290
car and I think that's a byproduct the

307
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,490
way you grew up but you know that's

308
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,470
something that you've been willing to

309
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,360
compromise for the time being but I

310
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,640
think that in terms of like what we

311
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,560
value obviously the things that matter

312
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,140
in terms of family and what we believe

313
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,550
in a line but in terms of what be like

314
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,620
where we envision ourselves living at

315
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,830
that kind of thing I think that's

316
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:13,180
probably been one of the only sources of

317
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:17,170
my car yeah we'll deal with it another

318
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:33,040
day or ten years or five years or three

319
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:36,300
years when we move back to me why are

320
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,300
you hesitant to tell me

321
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:45,230
I mean I think we're pretty open with

322
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:49,879
each other about most things I think

323
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:53,179
sometimes I'm hesitant to tell you like

324
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:56,240
what my fears are regarding my future

325
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:58,040
and as a result our future like then you

326
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,189
self doubt that I have regarding my

327
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,509
chosen career or whether or not I think

328
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:04,490
everything's in the pan now they try to

329
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:07,879
I kind of try to keep that to myself as

330
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,069
I know earlier I was I feel like I was a

331
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,170
lot more negative that I have now about

332
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:13,939
how things were going for me and I think

333
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,300
that affected our relationship the times

334
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:18,949
of me letting that negativity or not

335
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,480
being able to separate like I feel

336
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:23,059
shitty about the show that I've just did

337
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,399
so I'm gonna bring that over again for

338
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:27,379
the conversation that I have with you so

339
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,800
I think I try to kind of tamper that

340
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:33,110
down when I'm able to and I don't I

341
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,269
don't feel that way as much anymore but

342
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,639
there are times where I feel like I'm

343
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,589
gonna sulk and I just kind of do that on

344
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:44,119
my own on the train that I kind of let

345
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:46,220
it go that's how I get sacks well but

346
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:48,740
it's not you know I think if there's any

347
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,029
this situation where I'm upset I mean it

348
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,429
just happened this weekend where I feel

349
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,949
like I sure didn't go well like I'll

350
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:56,360
always talk to you about that because I

351
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:57,619
know not only that you're gonna listen

352
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,759
to me but you're gonna make me feel

353
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:04,369
better about it but I also don't want to

354
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,689
argue with that because I work in a

355
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:07,579
field where there's a lot of rejection

356
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,350
and negativity I did that every time I

357
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,580
was upset about something you guys

358
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,570
really

359
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:17,130
wimp so I don't know I mean in terms of

360
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,760
other stuff that I have medicine to tell

361
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:23,070
you lay it all out there I don't know I

362
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,230
mean I think we've we've gone out of our

363
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,270
way to talk about like people we've

364
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,820
dated and past relationships and that

365
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,070
sort of thing because I think it really

366
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,450
matters anymore like I know I feel like

367
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,010
neither of us were really coming out

368
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,010
like oh I just don't wanna hear about

369
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,260
anybody that you've been with this I

370
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,580
feel like it's a little unhealthy

371
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,080
honestly when people have this weird

372
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,850
mindset of like oh well we're together

373
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,180
now so let's pretend that neither of us

374
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,100
have ever been with anybody else before

375
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,590
if anything I think that's probably not

376
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,030
really the best approach but I don't

377
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,950
know I think we're pretty forthcoming

378
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:00,090
with each other are there things that

379
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,380
you like actively keep from me I mean I

380
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,730
think it goes to what we were saying

381
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,740
before about the difference in this

382
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:09,390
where it's like every time I feel like

383
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,250
oh okay homesickness to move back out of

384
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,130
the city or like every time I hear a

385
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,290
freaking car horn like can I just move

386
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,840
back to a place that doesn't have car

387
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,280
horns or you know a place where people

388
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,840
aren't yelling at each other all the

389
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,900
time or you don't have to take the

390
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,910
subway we'll don't sit on top of you or

391
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,790
stink all the time like lips or nose

392
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,520
clip their nails a public place like not

393
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:36,130
a lot of that mean there isn't and you

394
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,520
know when I think about raising a fan

395
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,790
getting married a lot of like my fears

396
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,550
around raising a family in the city come

397
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:49,000
up but I feel like where you don't tell

398
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,610
me all the time when you have a bad name

399
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,950
to show when I think about our future

400
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,620
together in New York I get really

401
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,650
nervous about living here forever yeah

402
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,480
when we talk about buying a place in New

403
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,450
York like wow that seems like an awesome

404
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,150
idea it also seems like tying us really

405
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,220
really deeply to New York and while

406
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,280
we're young that's awesome and it also

407
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:17,020
it's such a tough thing because you're

408
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,880
so tied to here with your job and I

409
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,470
could literally be anywhere as long as I

410
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,230
have my computer like I could literally

411
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:26,580
anywhere and that's what makes it so

412
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,800
tough to feel like I can always be like

413
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:33,190
you know super honest about where would

414
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,410
be or you know how I totally see my

415
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,920
future with well I feel like even if we

416
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,360
don't say it in specific terms we both

417
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,060
kind of have an understanding and an

418
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,220
agreement that like this is where I need

419
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,600
to be now and this is where we're

420
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,000
probably going to be for the foreseeable

421
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,310
future whether that's three years for

422
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,260
five years or seven years but that we

423
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,780
both agree that we don't want to raise

424
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,980
kids here and like live here forever but

425
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,450
I also know that that's tough when

426
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,640
there's not a like it I wish that there

427
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,930
were a scenario where I could say it's

428
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,820
going to take me five years to

429
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,820
accomplish XYZ that

430
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,140
anywhere and I'll just fly over

431
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:15,090
everybody even that sort of thing but

432
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,450
you know we know the best reality

433
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,200
situation I guess that's why how's it

434
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:29,190
Asami

435
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:45,090
yeah alright what privileges do you

436
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:48,570
think well recently but other than being

437
00:19:45,090 --> 00:20:00,690
me is generally generally like what to

438
00:19:48,570 --> 00:20:03,419
take for granted I mean just I guess

439
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:06,419
within I feel like I'm talking about

440
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:09,090
like comedy specifically but you know I

441
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,820
get really frustrated with going to your

442
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,190
shows mostly because I get frustrated

443
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,429
with many comedy specifically and I

444
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,590
think that if we're talking like this I

445
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:24,030
think I think that you erased me to

446
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:26,790
family where you were brought up to be

447
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:30,450
very conscious and conscientious person

448
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:34,049
about gender and your sister and mother

449
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,770
and father are very smart people who I

450
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:42,210
think are very aware of the way they

451
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:44,640
raised you to drew people home I go to

452
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:48,419
shows I get really frustrated because I

453
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,759
see a lot of like 95% guys and then

454
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,279
you're out of the show as always like

455
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:57,059
the girl talking about like the period

456
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,950
jokes and her moves and so it's been

457
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,859
tough for me to like go your shows

458
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:05,009
because I then complain to you after

459
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:09,090
about like the discrepancies in comedy

460
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:11,970
where it's like all you know 150 men

461
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:17,279
doing this and then one woman doing this

462
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:20,789
and then it's like why because just

463
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:24,509
numbers-wise it's a tie or side to man

464
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:26,429
versus and then I mean that's how for

465
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:27,059
you just to say we like travel on your

466
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,690
own

467
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,820
yeah but I don't know I don't think you

468
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:38,549
specifically take a lot of things for

469
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:47,299
granted I don't know you don't really

470
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:53,059
walk around like some man's shirt man

471
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:53,059
you know like there's some guys just on

472
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:06,179
one of this and you know exactly who I'm

473
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,649
talking about the way I'm talking about

474
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,950
these has to be well because I I could

475
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:16,399
not be engaged to someone who was this

476
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:20,220
stereotypical tango guy who was the rich

477
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:22,350
leave information maybe just a person of

478
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,359
certain race of a certain class who

479
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,159
works a certain job with warship types

480
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:34,169
of gloves that fins or a really certain

481
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:35,840
stereotype person yeah yeah and you

482
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:42,700
don't exert yourself like that

483
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,700
yeah good

484
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:57,279
that's your earliest political memory I

485
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:59,259
mean I think the first thing that I

486
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,409
really remember being aware of was the

487
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:04,659
Lewinsky thing because I was like 10 and

488
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:08,700
that was all anybody talked about for a

489
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:11,379
year and so I don't think it was ever

490
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,210
really explained to me what that like

491
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:14,979
what exactly was going on absolutely

492
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,710
never enough that my parents didn't

493
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:19,419
really feel like tackling the oral sex

494
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,619
is there anything oral sex conversation

495
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:21,419
I don't think that happens with kissing

496
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:24,879
parents

497
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:27,220
conversation yeah so I don't know that

498
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:28,869
you know because it's hard to really be

499
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,269
politically aware as a little kid other

500
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:32,739
than like knowing that important things

501
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:34,720
happen in the world like I remember when

502
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:38,080
the Oklahoma City bombing things like

503
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,320
that that's more world something in

504
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,190
politics but yeah Clinton is the first

505
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,720
president that I remember distinctly and

506
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:50,229
we you know my parents were both

507
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,139
Democrats and so they liked Clinton but

508
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:55,119
they're also fairly I think wasn't prude

509
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:57,999
but they're pretty traditional and so

510
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,159
one thing with what was he happy I think

511
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:01,570
they were very this

512
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,390
like well he's just confirming what

513
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:07,390
we've all thought about politics for you

514
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,039
know all the time basically this even

515
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,769
before that you kind of got the vibe

516
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,899
from him then he was this like very

517
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:17,620
slick talking kind of like smarmy guy

518
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:20,049
who he knew he was very meticulous with

519
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,470
how he was talking to people and

520
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:25,750
somebody pulling on running so it was

521
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,809
hard going to the 90s was nice because

522
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,429
everything was going so well you know

523
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,990
but I feel like I've said this to you

524
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,639
before I think the nineties were like

525
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,460
our version of the 50s it was this time

526
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:38,169
that everybody was back on now like I

527
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,149
say the best time I heard was making

528
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,970
those money and it was the best choice

529
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:45,850
and there's always a and weird feeling

530
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,100
around nostalgia when you grow up yeah I

531
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,210
think politically that's the first thing

532
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,320
that I really remember and then

533
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:56,830
obviously the defining moment of my

534
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,789
childhood is 9/11 which I mean it's hard

535
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:02,470
to not enter to find out of politics I

536
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,960
mean that was my fourth day of high

537
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,820
school and I lived in New Jersey so

538
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,480
there were people who knew people who

539
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,370
were there and I think that's the first

540
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,750
time I really like took an interest in

541
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,340
what was going out of the world because

542
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,399
you couldn't ignore it anymore

543
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:21,240
like I still remember the day after that

544
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:23,320
happened when we were in homeroom and

545
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,210
they had us do the Pledge of Allegiance

546
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,590
and nobody could get through it like it

547
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,940
makes me choked up now think about this

548
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,470
is something you've recited since you

549
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,200
were five without ever thinking about

550
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,700
the context of it and then all of a

551
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,610
sudden that we got this different

552
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,560
meaning so yeah I think that probably is

553
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:48,500
the whiskey thing and then obviously

554
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:50,570
the world change living how do you think

555
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,560
I was influenced by growing up as a

556
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,520
first-generation American and what would

557
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,710
you change

558
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:03,590
I don't that means what what I change is

559
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,740
that for me maybe I'm s to myself doing

560
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,210
it well well how do you think I was I

561
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,490
was influenced by growing I was the

562
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:14,590
first generation in America well I think

563
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:19,640
that one of the interesting things about

564
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:23,240
talking to your dad and listening to him

565
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:26,630
and just sort of watching him obviously

566
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,960
you know me I know most of my life like

567
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,810
observing people and if I can do mostly

568
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:36,830
observing and less talking I'm a happier

569
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:40,510
person but watching your dad he's a

570
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:45,200
really fascinating guy he's always

571
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:50,480
thinking about ways that he can better

572
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:54,500
himself save money and help you guys and

573
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:59,690
I think those are three qualities that

574
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:03,290
you have taken in and that he's not your

575
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:05,390
mom as well and I think that we're gonna

576
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,180
happen potentially in the hallway family

577
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,120
like I did yeah not that my parents

578
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,100
didn't instill some of those qualities

579
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,260
but thinking about money and the ways

580
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,630
that he does not you know a thing

581
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,700
we think about like if my mom wants to

582
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,580
buy something it's like did it let's

583
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,799
imagine I absolutely machine buy better

584
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,870
polar opposites in terms of you know she

585
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,040
doesn't really think about what she's

586
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:32,600
spending her what she's spending it on

587
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:35,690
whereas my dad completely invest you

588
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,370
know when you grow up with nothing I see

589
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,049
then you go one of two directions you

590
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,280
either over adult everybody and buy all

591
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:43,640
the things that you wish you could have

592
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,309
had or you go in his direction which is

593
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,770
being so overly frugal that you can't

594
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:50,929
even fully enjoy the money that you've

595
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,870
made and it kind of I mean he's occupied

596
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:55,010
like he's what almost six years old and

597
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,020
I don't think a day goes by where he

598
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,780
doesn't think about money in some

599
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,309
capacity and it's because of growing up

600
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,890
that way and I feel badly for him

601
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:07,070
sometimes because he's done such amazing

602
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,510
things for himself in America and he has

603
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,780
a very comfortable life but I don't know

604
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:14,660
that he ever can fully appreciate that

605
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,309
yeah but I think not that you're not

606
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,679
appreciative of what you have but when

607
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:21,620
you have a dad like I do who came from

608
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,330
nothing in other stands what it means to

609
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,429
like kind of place yourself up by the

610
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,070
bootstraps I think that's been a good

611
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:32,750
example for me in terms of not taking

612
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,059
comfort for granted necessarily after I

613
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,090
do but just knowing what he went through

614
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:41,650
it kind of is a motivating factor to not

615
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,650
be lazy

616
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,360
yeah

617
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:00,680
how do you think my political views have

618
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:07,640
affected my relationship with my family

619
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:10,530
well I I perceive you as somebody who

620
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,340
you agree with me on those things in

621
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,190
terms of life

622
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,890
ideologically you know you think there

623
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,440
should be probably more control over

624
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,360
your choice that's like the world I have

625
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,180
a lot of important issues but I think

626
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,860
that you are more disillusioned with

627
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,140
politics that I am like I'm more

628
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,640
inclined to get behind somebody like

629
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,250
Obama or that sort of thing we're in

630
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,020
it's going well they're all kind of

631
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,030
crappy what do you think that's an

632
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,440
accurate thing to say I mean I don't

633
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,630
know if I'd go that far to say they're

634
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,190
all kind of crappy but but then I think

635
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,660
you're I think you have it sometimes you

636
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,060
get frustrated with just how the system

637
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,880
is I get frustrated with media

638
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:51,030
portrayals generally of all politics

639
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,850
regardless of party like I get

640
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,940
frustrated with the fact that you know

641
00:29:53,850 --> 00:30:00,780
Hillary Clinton wait and Jeb Bush sad

642
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,190
today are things that people well in

643
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,560
terms of your relationship with your

644
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:08,030
family I think because of the fact that

645
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:11,040
your mom is so like super right wing you

646
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:13,710
have had to make a conscious decision as

647
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,440
a SMI especially to just let a lot of

648
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,850
stuff kind of let a lot of stuff go

649
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,940
because it's not worth having the

650
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,310
argument or saying what are you talking

651
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,870
about that's not true when you know that

652
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:27,480
you not necessarily changed somebody's

653
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:30,000
viewpoint because I think I mean I don't

654
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,820
know is your dad is he registered as a

655
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,580
Republican I think actually like my dad

656
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,850
may be even more Republican than my mom

657
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,460
just not a cycle

658
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,710
last focus like my mom was willing to

659
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:45,279
engage and just all our screaming

660
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,549
matches as we both yeah well know about

661
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,690
her beliefs luckily this past year she's

662
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:55,149
told that a little bit down from some of

663
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,440
the viewpoints that she's had but if you

664
00:30:55,149 --> 00:31:02,649
get dad talking he's pretty right-wing

665
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,730
in a lot of his viewpoints you know and

666
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:09,129
especially this way or this way and you

667
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:12,669
know on the moral side of things as well

668
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:15,450
but I think technically a might even a

669
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:18,399
registered Republican because when I was

670
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:20,950
able to register to vote my parents told

671
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,590
me that was all the only choice that I

672
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,350
had was to register you know as I didn't

673
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,860
know that you didn't have to I really

674
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:33,909
didn't like so I got to the place where

675
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:36,610
you go to vote to go vote for Obama and

676
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:38,500
I like in the product brother you were

677
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:43,629
in either and I didn't realize that you

678
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:45,970
couldn't vote for anyone in the front so

679
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:49,659
that was a little bit of a black down to

680
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,490
kind of like I feel like you whatever

681
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:53,769
opinions your parents have you've been

682
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,840
able to separate that from forming your

683
00:31:53,769 --> 00:32:00,490
own opinions well luckily I mean I went

684
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:03,340
to after high school because going to a

685
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,500
Catholic High School you have so many

686
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,210
viewpoints pushed on to your entire life

687
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,009
you know if you go to a Catholic Mass

688
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,840
every single Wednesday and you would

689
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:12,879
amass on Sunday then you have people

690
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,919
telling you exactly what you need to do

691
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:15,710
then you have the bishop coming and

692
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,330
saying hey

693
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:20,059
came from an anti-gay marriage

694
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,470
commercial isn't that great like you

695
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,330
just grow up with these viewpoints

696
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,659
shoved in your face and so when I went

697
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:29,720
to college I had anthropology I had

698
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:33,799
gender studies I had I mean liberal arts

699
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,580
college yeah there were so many other

700
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,610
options

701
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,299
and so I guess I took the opposite route

702
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:43,309
and said I'm just going to do it exactly

703
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:46,880
against everything that I've been told

704
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:50,630
to do and try to just learn everything I

705
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,820
possibly can about what else exists not

706
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,010
follow everything I've been told to

707
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,779
learn and just go the opposite way

708
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,570
you think that has more to do with kind

709
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:01,039
of rebelling against the education that

710
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,720
you had whether climate that were more

711
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,770
about your parents or I think it has to

712
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,990
do with me wanting to hope that more

713
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:13,789
exists than what people are saying

714
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:17,299
because their viewpoints yeah it'd be so

715
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:20,090
sad for me if all that existed was what

716
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:22,399
people sat on base so if all that

717
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:27,710
existed was like nope any people are

718
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:29,299
back down and story like that right and

719
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,169
like that's all people learned growing

720
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:35,840
up so I think that was my goal of in

721
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:39,590
going to college was only take classes

722
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,830
that were like absolutely I took classes

723
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,480
and

724
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,370
I take classes and moods at my tech

725
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,140
classes like in every single other

726
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:48,149
religion that Catholicism just because I

727
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,730
did not want to learn anything that I

728
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:57,750
had learned before she was really mad

729
00:33:52,730 --> 00:34:00,320
mad that you were learning that for me

730
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:04,710
to learn things that she didn't think

731
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,149
were useful in any way wasn't what she

732
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,590
thought they were useful as she didn't

733
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:10,889
want you taking class about Islam or

734
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:12,510
this or that but also that like when I

735
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,839
told them I was getting a degree in

736
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:19,169
gender studies that was like the world

737
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,929
was ending like how could I was spending

738
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:24,750
almost a quarter million dollars on a

739
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:27,659
college education where I would never in

740
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,580
a million years get a job or be thought

741
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,310
of as an intelligent person right like

742
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,950
I'm not a lawyer a doctor I'm not like

743
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,230
going to run the world because I can

744
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:41,669
only think about culture like oh god

745
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:43,320
yeah when you but when it comes up like

746
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:44,909
now now with your parents obviously but

747
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,560
someone says I go what you majored in

748
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,169
college I saw big laughter I got laughs

749
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,270
yeah so what do you feel like you have

750
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:54,149
to explain yourself yes no I remember

751
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:58,050
that but somebody today said oh that

752
00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:01,260
makes my politics degree sound like I'm

753
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:06,599
a genius and I was like I'm at work oh

754
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:10,020
yeah thinking I had your dick but in

755
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,589
real life I was like I probably know a

756
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,480
lot more about culture race religion and

757
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,369
how to talk about them in a way that

758
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,099
doesn't piss people off but also isn't

759
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:23,510
to PC yeah so like you can really just

760
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:26,790
go somewhere else like it doesn't matter

761
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,430
yeah that's a little off topic but I

762
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,500
think that that way of being able to

763
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:34,580
shape how I talk about things too and

764
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:38,910
walk that really fine line between

765
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:40,560
pissing my mom off angry my dad and

766
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,810
still believing in what I want to

767
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,080
believe in has been a

768
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,700
Yeah right I think the biggest bail for

769
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,950
you or anybody who majors in gender

770
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,260
studies as a woman is for people to not

771
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,360
just assume you're someone like raving

772
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,530
feminist two things all men are equal

773
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,270
because I think that's not to see what

774
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,890
people think about gender studies well I

775
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:03,000
think that's what that questionnaire I

776
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:05,130
felt like you know I don't you know I

777
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,220
don't think that there's necessarily

778
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,680
like a set person and I think that I

779
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,560
walked into a lot of stereotypes when I

780
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,500
was in college to playing hockey being

781
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,300
Gender Studies major being for main you

782
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,490
know just being athletic in general you

783
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:26,970
know there's a lot of different

784
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:28,650
stereotypes about you like - so are you

785
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:34,530
concerned that I won't be able to

786
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:38,490
provide health care for the family my

787
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:43,260
job which is a good thing because I

788
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:46,020
didn't yeah yeah well luckily I work for

789
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,660
employee benefits company so the

790
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:51,660
benefits are actually a great so I don't

791
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:56,190
actually think in today's world that

792
00:36:51,660 --> 00:37:00,330
really matters who's you know getting

793
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:02,790
the we talk about this it's like we kind

794
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:06,090
of make high five that if one year

795
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,890
you're making a ton of money then that's

796
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,930
awesome if the next year I'm making in

797
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,730
time I need that's awesome yeah if it's

798
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,790
because I have a full-time job we're

799
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:19,680
getting covered with healthcare that's

800
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:21,890
awesome so no I'm not worried good I'll

801
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,890
provide

802
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:37,010
how do you think that political system

803
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:42,140
has failed us you or me well I think

804
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:45,500
there's so little bipartisanship that

805
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,000
it's just I mean I was saying bias that

806
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,859
somebody who's an Obama supporter but

807
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,599
the amount that the Republican Senate

808
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:57,590
has blocked everything that he's trying

809
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,270
to do even at the expense of benefiting

810
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:02,450
the American people just to promote a

811
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:07,790
certain agenda it's really troubling to

812
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:09,849
me so you know I think I'm not

813
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,800
necessarily somebody who has any

814
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,359
delusions that one president is going to

815
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,160
make everything great one person is

816
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:18,470
gonna make everything horrible but I

817
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,060
think there's so much bickering at this

818
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,000
point that there's not really a lot

819
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:26,320
that's been accomplished I don't really

820
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,900
know how how that changes obviously I

821
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,400
don't know what do you think I

822
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,619
definitely have to agree with you as

823
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,960
Steven reading daily even with the

824
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:38,240
Supreme Court being at a floor floor

825
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,460
traveling without holding things up they

826
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,520
were I was reading that with them at

827
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:48,050
tides turning into that said that

828
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,839
nothing will pass technicality and well

829
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:55,430
every other moment suggests will be shot

830
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:57,920
down yeah ice that bipartisanship is

831
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:01,339
really what and here's me a lot like

832
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,500
that so there's a lot of awesome you

833
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:08,780
know people from me like Olympia Snowe

834
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:11,690
who you know left politics because of

835
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:16,220
bipartisanship like it was so angering

836
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:20,320
that she would she left and she was in I

837
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:23,859
think for 18 years and

838
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,680
and it's women like that but I think

839
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:31,750
politics needs and I think when people

840
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:34,390
get so mired with AI Republic and I need

841
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,340
to believe this and I'm a Democrat I

842
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,040
need to believe this and you can't see

843
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,859
anywhere in the mill thousand it's so

844
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,070
dangerous like and people aren't even

845
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:46,510
willing to say I call somewhere in the

846
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:49,660
middle because there's no candidate

847
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,250
that's all smart right yeah I think well

848
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,140
that's why I'm gonna do it on these two

849
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,820
and Leno or whatever we're they would

850
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,950
literally read people quotes from the

851
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,300
other candidates and attributed to you

852
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,190
know some of those like Obama versus

853
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,900
McCain they say like well Barack Obama

854
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,540
said blah blah blah even if it was

855
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,340
McCain club and the person would be like

856
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,810
oh no that's ridiculous even if they

857
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,359
said they were McCain supporter you know

858
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:12,100
anything like people they all they it's

859
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:15,010
a very black and white and I think that

860
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,960
I mean that's why I think you've so

861
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,460
similar quizzes up saying like just what

862
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,350
are the issue that you care about and

863
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,240
what do you believe and then we're going

864
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,910
to tell you who your most aligned with

865
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,170
politically and so that way you're not

866
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,460
just saying oh well I agree with that

867
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,619
because it's Hillary and I think that's

868
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,359
ridiculous because Ted Cruz even though

869
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:33,760
I probably would be saying hey Lenny why

870
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,670
do you think people are so ill-informed

871
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,190
or missing Park develop so much like why

872
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:41,500
you think those like hey what do you

873
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:44,290
think about this like those always do so

874
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,380
well on the streets that was a dumb

875
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:50,530
people yeah yeah like I was reading

876
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:53,380
today like people were saying oh I'm so

877
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,390
upset that my federal income tax is so

878
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,250
high with like forty four percent of

879
00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:01,119
people don't you pay federal income tax

880
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,320
yeah like you're upset and fifty six

881
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,140
percent

882
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,390
that's you know well in a year and over

883
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,250
now of comments sections being the way

884
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,440
people communicate it's just a sound

885
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,300
ring also a lot outraged about something

886
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,400
people really don't know three people

887
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,240
like it and so all of a sudden gives you

888
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,480
this ego boost

889
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,880
three people support your idiotic claims

890
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,980
and so all of a sudden you're on your

891
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,560
massive soapbox with your political

892
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,010
beliefs so I just think it's dangerous

893
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,550
when people get out of it those tanks

894
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,190
and riots

895
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:37,480
yeah I think that I mean to your right

896
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,320
there there's no most interesting and I

897
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,060
don't know I guess is putting in more

898
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,920
people than on politicians themselves

899
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,780
but when people have that mindset of

900
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,020
like well this is a party online with so

901
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:51,109
everything they say is the gospel and no

902
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:54,080
logic from the other side will even

903
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:56,119
enter my brain I think that's that could

904
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,910
be kind of dangerous so sort of office

905
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,700
is on there but with I think a lot of

906
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:05,599
the theme of this election with Bernie

907
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:09,220
Sanders itself is great you know how

908
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,200
super PACs and a lot of money has been a

909
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:15,140
driving force like do you think that has

910
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,480
been well people have talked about what

911
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,690
if they disallowed that from happening

912
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,339
what if they said you cannot take that

913
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,900
kind of money everything has to be

914
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,609
funded based on like you all have

915
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,170
essentially the same allotment for your

916
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,450
campaign it's the same way that you know

917
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,060
when you lost an Oh Jay show it wasn't

918
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:34,160
the problem was that the legal system is

919
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,060
unfair when one person can have a lawyer

920
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,710
that there

921
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,770
the other person has a public defender

922
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:42,530
it's not going to be fair so of course

923
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,900
in politics that give somebody who has a

924
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,270
ton of support financially from super

925
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,040
PACs and from all these supporters right

926
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,760
you're it's going to be very hard to

927
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,950
compete with that

928
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,720
for examines trying to use that to his

929
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,220
advantage saying like look I'm not like

930
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,920
everybody else in taking all these

931
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,960
handouts I'm raising money getting small

932
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,580
donations on but yeah I think it would I

933
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,140
think it would probably be better and

934
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,420
obviously even people who get a lot of

935
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,790
money I think it would be a lot less

936
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,110
stressful for them also so they could

937
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,390
focus on the things that you care about

938
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:13,870
rather than trying to curry favor from a

939
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:18,170
bunch of people who have deep pockets

940
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:25,280
that's one of what scares you the most

941
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:28,010
these days I think the fact we talk

942
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,680
about this but what scares me the most

943
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:37,150
is the direction of this country is

944
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:39,380
heading in without a true and clear

945
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,660
definition of where the leadership is

946
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,730
going you know and people are saying

947
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:48,410
yeah it's going to be Hillary and Trump

948
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:52,040
at the end and that's you know find her

949
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:54,110
the people who believe in both but

950
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,130
that's still a little scary for me and I

951
00:43:54,110 --> 00:44:00,350
think that having an unclear path and

952
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,940
such a bipartisan druing and also it's

953
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,770
really scary that Trump has made it this

954
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:07,940
far that's what really scares me it

955
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:11,320
scares me that so many people in this

956
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:13,370
nation can believe in a guy like that

957
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,660
but at least we live in a place where

958
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,030
there is the checks and balances you

959
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,370
know anything he's not going to be

960
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:20,770
Korean from yeah but I guess the thing

961
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,720
about it that I cover in violence

962
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:27,490
is was my life significantly different

963
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,610
when george w bush was president versus

964
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:32,320
when Obama was president but I think it

965
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:35,830
would be different if Travis Rosen

966
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:38,170
probably because I I think that we can

967
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:40,990
look back in 50 years

968
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,910
don't forget cruising he's almost I'm

969
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:45,580
gonna try to reverse a lot of things but

970
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:47,350
I think that we'll look back in 50 or

971
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,710
100 years people could agree with this

972
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:52,630
or not disagree with this turnout but

973
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:55,330
fifty or hundred years Bush and Obama I

974
00:44:52,630 --> 00:45:00,250
think will be looked up in history books

975
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:02,110
as you know good press hence yeah but I

976
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,170
think that if Trump was president it

977
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:06,940
would be a disaster yeah it would be a

978
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:09,010
worldwide disaster it's just kind of

979
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,110
like a mockery and that's so scary

980
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:16,080
yeah because when you when you hear

981
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:19,360
about plans or attempts at plans like

982
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,830
destroying the Middle East building wall

983
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,300
but that is scary

984
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:28,560
how do you bring a child into the world

985
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:32,610
with things like that being said with

986
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:36,130
the quote where he said if I don't win

987
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:39,940
I'm not threatening violence but it may

988
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:42,310
happen like notice yeah he's a time

989
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:45,310
Cleveland like right that's a real thing

990
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:47,320
that you say and he's like taunting

991
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,760
these white people to say like let's go

992
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,920
be violent against people that don't

993
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,560
vote for us that's insane that's a very

994
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,870
dangerous world that we are living like

995
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,900
that's not I mean I think but again I

996
00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:02,110
think whoever whoever's in charge think

997
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,690
that's scary now it's just the capacity

998
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:06,940
for like random acts of mass violence

999
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,500
until that will be terrorism it can be

1000
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:12,670
like in terms of

1001
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:15,460
but the fact that you can have seemingly

1002
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:17,230
a safe plan for your day where I'm going

1003
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,840
to get up and take a shower or go to the

1004
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,030
movies and you could get shot there like

1005
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,380
that's not how it always was so that but

1006
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,800
I also think that on the other side that

1007
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,990
you can't just live your life and that's

1008
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,220
what we always try setting them on like

1009
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:33,100
what I'm gonna talk about living in New

1010
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,450
York you can't live your life not riding

1011
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,850
the drink and you can't live your life

1012
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,190
not going to work you can't live your

1013
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,200
life afraid of absolutely everything

1014
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,550
because anything could happen

1015
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:52,300
how do you function they're just yeah

1016
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:54,370
you'd be crippled is their life so what

1017
00:46:52,300 --> 00:47:07,750
issues do you wish I cared about more

1018
00:46:54,370 --> 00:47:09,370
and why I think you do really that's

1019
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:26,550
like a Syria you lack the like you

1020
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:29,260
really do well that's not yeah okay I

1021
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:31,210
think I feel like there are times where

1022
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,220
I wish I cared about stuff more in terms

1023
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,750
of actually like it's easy to talk about

1024
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,070
like oh I feel this very feel that way

1025
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,170
but I don't know that either was really

1026
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,370
do a lot about it other than having a

1027
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,950
conversation about it

1028
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:45,340
but I also don't know that I want to

1029
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,180
make that effort I feel like well there

1030
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,500
are some things

1031
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:51,610
I feel like I just get enraged about

1032
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,110
yeah and I feel like you haven't like

1033
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,730
studied up because like I do a lot of

1034
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,820
reading during the week on the subway

1035
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:59,200
and I'll just get really angry about at

1036
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,970
the time but then when I realized that

1037
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,650
you don't or haven't read about them

1038
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,230
either I'll just like forget about them

1039
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,550
or drop them like what sort like a lot

1040
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,730
of the things are just things going on

1041
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:14,290
in the world or my celebrity gossip that

1042
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:16,390
I love dearly like I don't know I can't

1043
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:21,460
think about anything specifically but

1044
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:34,920
usually why I bring things out hold on a

1045
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:38,160
sec we're getting down to the end here

1046
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,160
how you doing

1047
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,240
Carmela yeah

1048
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:55,630
we're you guys filming stuff out there

1049
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,630
for this - or different job

1050
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,130
she helped

1051
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,090
help ya

1052
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:35,720
I can promote this car if it's Darius

1053
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,630
how do you think that what parents

1054
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:30,349
vehicle Jews have affected our

1055
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:36,980
relationship of what would you change I

1056
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:38,390
think probably my parents have so I know

1057
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:42,799
that you get frustrated with the way

1058
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:48,500
that my parents are such that comes

1059
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:50,960
across with her political views I don't

1060
00:50:48,500 --> 00:51:09,470
think it's truly like beginning it may

1061
00:50:50,960 --> 00:51:11,170
have in some ways affected I don't know

1062
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:15,829
if I would change it this is my mom's

1063
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:18,380
works yeah it hasn't because of the fact

1064
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:20,510
that they believe even all but all for

1065
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,230
been in the same room months oh right

1066
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,690
yeah

1067
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,390
that wasn't bad well it was fine but I

1068
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:29,029
mean the thing is if they lived in the

1069
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:30,700
same town and we had the opportunity for

1070
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:32,359
them to get together every two weeks I

1071
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,480
don't know that that would necessarily

1072
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:37,220
be a great thing but I think that in the

1073
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,329
capacity that it is now which is they

1074
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:44,240
communicate through us largely and see

1075
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:45,740
each other for you know our wedding and

1076
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,529
important events and that sort of thing

1077
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,529
I think everyone will be cool

1078
00:51:54,150 --> 00:52:04,150
who sacrifices more in our relationship

1079
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:06,610
and why I mean I think just objectively

1080
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:10,270
you've made more sacrifices than I have

1081
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:12,460
a necessity in that when we've been

1082
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,570
together you know for a year and a half

1083
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:18,790
long distance and I was here just by the

1084
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:20,650
nature of the situation I didn't have

1085
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:22,000
the flexibility to say all right well

1086
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:26,590
I'm going to come to you although to me

1087
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,990
so you know I think that is the

1088
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:30,340
number-one thing the fact that you were

1089
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,310
willing to leave replaced you live

1090
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:36,280
literally your entire life to being an

1091
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:40,240
absolutely new environment I don't think

1092
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:44,130
I can really equal that in any way but I

1093
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:47,850
think that I try to do a good job of I

1094
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:49,960
guess maybe smaller things or at least

1095
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:52,240
listening to you or listening to your

1096
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,350
point of view on stuff when there's

1097
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,170
something that's more important to you

1098
00:52:53,350 --> 00:53:01,200
or something that would help Plagueis

1099
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:01,200
alleviate some of the loneliness or what

1100
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,570
but no I mean when wouldn't the

1101
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:09,330
situation presented itself to move to

1102
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,230
where we are on Bay Ridge now and

1103
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,910
initially when you brought it up I was

1104
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,980
very I don't say dismiss it but I was

1105
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:16,570
very insistent that I wanted to stay in

1106
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,910
Astoria because I liked it and I was

1107
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:21,070
comfortable there and I knew people you

1108
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:24,280
know I was friends with come to their

1109
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:27,310
level but but I think that when I took a

1110
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:30,190
step back and realized what you were

1111
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:33,820
asking of me versus what I had asked of

1112
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:35,770
you it wasn't even close so for me to

1113
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:38,470
say like no you have to live in the city

1114
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:39,240
but also the one part of the one borough

1115
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,760
that I

1116
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,680
it would have been really unreasonable

1117
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,080
and so when things like that come up or

1118
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,940
even I mean we joke about the idea of

1119
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,010
getting a dog or something I've got the

1120
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:53,970
guy I understand that the reality of the

1121
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:55,710
situation is that I don't necessarily

1122
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:58,140
have a ton of friends that I see often

1123
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:00,390
but all of my family and friends are

1124
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,760
much closer to me than yours are to you

1125
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:05,640
and I know that that's really hard and

1126
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:08,099
so even though I never imagined getting

1127
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,050
a dog how you when something like that

1128
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:11,400
comes up I don't just think of it that's

1129
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,240
black and white like do I want a dog

1130
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,060
doing that one

1131
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,270
it's what would it mean to you and would

1132
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:20,190
it be something that would like improve

1133
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:22,230
your quality of life quite obviously and

1134
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:26,280
happiness because of the fact that I've

1135
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:28,560
had to ask a lot of people I think it is

1136
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,770
like an even sacrificing obviously on

1137
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,740
that at the beginning moving down here

1138
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:37,980
was similarly a lot and I need you a lot

1139
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:40,020
of my friends and especially like my

1140
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:43,200
family probably even still to this day

1141
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:45,119
some of my pen looks like why you why

1142
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,070
did you move to New York I stood and

1143
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,390
kept that with you and know that I love

1144
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,160
you and that we're getting married to

1145
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,820
get all the bad stuff from like moving

1146
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,630
to New York

1147
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:58,230
when clearly I'm so in love with the

1148
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:59,760
idea of Maine seems like there's crazy

1149
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,960
idea like oh yeah you wouldn't you

1150
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,010
wouldn't have moved I mean they're

1151
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,390
planning actually there's plenty people

1152
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,800
who live in Maine and always want to

1153
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,750
live the city of theirs so they went to

1154
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,609
Boston to New York whatever but they're

1155
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:13,190
like that's not it's right but that's

1156
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:14,180
you envision for yourself yeah anything

1157
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,440
happen that we say would have been

1158
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:19,309
easier definitely I was gonna go there

1159
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,650
anyways so go deal with this guy but I

1160
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:24,980
don't think that I don't think you want

1161
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:28,069
to pay that sacrifice if what we had was

1162
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:31,190
wasn't worth because that's a huge thing

1163
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:33,109
to do yeah and I think that at the

1164
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:36,410
beginning way of beginning we both

1165
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:38,359
sacrificed a lot like all those trips

1166
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:43,400
driving to each other in what was ours

1167
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:46,039
are mega buses mega bus yeah I mean

1168
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:49,009
that's the certainly for the first year

1169
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:53,180
and a half it was a lot of sacrifice

1170
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:55,460
both ways in terms of just literally the

1171
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,739
logistics of it you know to make it work

1172
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:00,440
to see each other at least once a month

1173
00:55:57,739 --> 00:56:02,359
which is what we tried to do that meant

1174
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,730
that you or I we're going to have to

1175
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:07,579
drive or take a series of buses eight

1176
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:09,710
hours to see each other and I think that

1177
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:12,799
from the beginning was the reflection of

1178
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:15,079
the fact that what we had going out was

1179
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,029
worth all that effort because we would

1180
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:19,519
have been insane to go through that if

1181
00:56:17,029 --> 00:56:22,390
it was just for something like casual

1182
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:22,390
sort of thing

1183
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:29,720
if you have a daughter what do you hope

1184
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,350
will be different for her in the future

1185
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,350
as a woman

1186
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:47,260
I hope that if I have a daughter that

1187
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:49,540
chelonian have to think about the fact

1188
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:52,050
that she would be different from son if

1189
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:54,310
that makes sense yeah

1190
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,630
she wouldn't even have to think about

1191
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,140
the fact that being a Gender Studies

1192
00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:01,900
major would be different than being a

1193
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:04,450
pre-law student that she would have to

1194
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:06,790
think about meeting 75 cents on the

1195
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:08,710
dollar to like stupid things like that

1196
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,620
that people bring up every time they

1197
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:14,740
think about gender disability that's a

1198
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,690
big it's a big deal and I really hope

1199
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,220
that that type of thing is something

1200
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:21,190
that she never even has to think about

1201
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:23,890
yeah like she could just grow up and do

1202
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:26,700
whatever the hell she wants and not have

1203
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:30,610
to think about who she wants to do it

1204
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:33,400
what patterns you wants to use what

1205
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:37,000
religion she wants to be if she wants to

1206
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:40,030
you know go to college or not go to

1207
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,240
college whatever like I think that's

1208
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:47,020
like my biggest goal it's just to allow

1209
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:51,760
my daughter's son whatever genders child

1210
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:54,280
I have just allowing them to really be

1211
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,470
whoever they wanted me because I think

1212
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,170
that if you don't and I think a little

1213
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:02,260
bit of this was on me and I luckily grew

1214
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:06,100
the other way but I see and I I saw a

1215
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:08,880
lot of kids that grew into a very

1216
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:12,640
horrible like militaristic and

1217
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,380
uneducated version of a person because

1218
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,920
they were told what they were supposed

1219
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:19,780
to be I think that that isn't healthy

1220
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,480
and so I'm just hoping to not tell

1221
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:26,790
anyone what to do other than keep them

1222
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,790
safe yeah yeah

1223
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:38,350
what you hope I've learned from you

1224
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:39,580
today both of us well I mean again I

1225
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,530
think we have a pretty transparent

1226
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:44,020
relationship and so I don't know that I

1227
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:46,660
necessarily came into tonight thinking

1228
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,670
that I was gonna have some sort of you

1229
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,210
know bombshell discovery about something

1230
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:54,070
that you and I had done

1231
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:55,920
but I hope that it's apparent to you

1232
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:59,380
that these are things that I think about

1233
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:03,190
even if I don't localize that verbalize

1234
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:06,940
that you know that if you ever feel like

1235
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:08,890
I'm not conscious of the sacrifices that

1236
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,170
you've made or I'm not aware of the

1237
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,850
things that are important to you or the

1238
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,410
things that you hope for us in the

1239
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,630
future that that's something that I'm

1240
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:18,730
kind of always thinking about even if

1241
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:21,220
I'm not specifically talking about it or

1242
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:23,170
thinking about it that whole which I

1243
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,970
hope that you know that but you know

1244
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:26,440
it's not something that we always say

1245
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:28,030
like all right well for the next 15

1246
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:31,119
minutes let's talk about our future it's

1247
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:33,400
just stuff that we've kind of brought up

1248
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:37,090
at various times and then three plus

1249
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:40,840
years we've been together I didn't know

1250
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:42,880
I could stare at you for this long now I

1251
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,760
feel like we don't really talk that much

1252
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,880
about political things like I think when

1253
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,890
we finally get to spend time together

1254
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,980
because it seems not like Rare but like

1255
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:56,920
kind of opportunity sort of just spend

1256
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,270
that time together catch up on the

1257
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,560
things that happen in the day and don't

1258
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:04,690
really want to get weighed down by

1259
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,460
political things or like when I because

1260
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:10,050
I kind of get worked up because I just

1261
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:10,050
don't like when people

1262
01:00:11,229 --> 01:00:16,579
and so I guess it was nice getting to

1263
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:18,619
hear you you know talk a little bit

1264
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:22,279
about some of your opinions about

1265
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:25,579
side-eye I think I started realized that

1266
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:28,329
we do agree on them nothing in the class

1267
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:32,089
we agree but I think we actually agree a

1268
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:35,869
lot more than I thought that yeah I mean

1269
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:37,759
I kind of wonder how people have strong

1270
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:40,789
relationships when they don't agree on

1271
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:43,009
like fundamental things you know I was

1272
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:45,859
worried going into this that we were and

1273
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:47,119
I like disagree on political things like

1274
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:48,979
I was the ring there are some things

1275
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:53,359
that we that we do disagree on that I

1276
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:55,519
think if you mean that we were just whoa

1277
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:58,700
that's like a huge bombshell I'm like

1278
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:00,469
didn't know you loved Trump today like

1279
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,609
that would have been like a big thing I

1280
01:01:00,469 --> 01:01:04,339
would have learned but you know I think

1281
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:08,140
that a lot of this stuff that we on the

1282
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:10,579
basilar related group all right

1283
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:15,229
do you think I'd make a good president

1284
01:01:10,579 --> 01:01:20,450
or political leader here Obama

1285
01:01:15,229 --> 01:01:26,269
impression on us I don't know honey

1286
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:29,150
honestly I'm sorry listen uh yeah I

1287
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:33,499
think that you like pleasing a lot of

1288
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:35,180
people and that's a good thing but you

1289
01:01:33,499 --> 01:01:36,559
also don't like letting people down and

1290
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:39,710
I think that to be a leader

1291
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:45,940
unfortunately I have to let at least 50%

1292
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:45,940
or 49% of people check so you may well

1293
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:51,960
your dream job that way no I literally

1294
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,549
agree I think I mean up still a kind of

1295
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,599
playful Arabic I find that that one

1296
01:01:53,549 --> 01:01:56,579
person doesn't like me I'm very

1297
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,500
flustered I know and so we still know

1298
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,799
exactly who that person was it didn't

1299
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,660
like that one show three years ago I

1300
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:06,480
don't know yeah I don't think I have the

1301
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:11,099
stomach for any that stuff I think that

1302
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:14,400
I'm also a very I try to be a very moral

1303
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:16,170
person in the sense that if I've done

1304
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,869
something that I feel like is wrong or

1305
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:20,869
slated somebody I it really bothers me

1306
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:38,910
yeah why do you love me so many reasons

1307
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:43,140
I love you because everything has always

1308
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:45,930
been really really easy it's been

1309
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:47,819
everything about us is what people say

1310
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:51,029
doesn't exist when people talk about

1311
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:53,880
what an ideal relationship is it doesn't

1312
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:55,500
mean that you have created 100% all the

1313
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,920
time on every single thing you talk

1314
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:02,819
about but it's having that perfect

1315
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:05,549
perfect mixture of friendship with

1316
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:07,920
attraction with respect for somebody and

1317
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:10,559
I think that's in our entire

1318
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,589
relationship as angers have been each

1319
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,880
other and

1320
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:17,109
time about big things whether it was you

1321
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,519
being willing to move here or whether or

1322
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:21,039
not think you're gonna work out there

1323
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:23,019
was never a time that we cursed at each

1324
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,950
other or said things that we can take

1325
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:30,069
back and I think that that has laid the

1326
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,489
groundwork for a really awesome life

1327
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:35,200
together

1328
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:37,299
and I think that it's just a level of

1329
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,950
comfort than I have with you that I

1330
01:03:37,299 --> 01:03:41,979
haven't had with anybody else and that's

1331
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:43,960
why even when we think about the future

1332
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:45,880
none of that scares me because I know

1333
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:49,319
that as long as you and I are doing all

1334
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,319
that stuff together it's gonna be fine

1335
01:03:53,400 --> 01:04:00,069
yeah Cheers have any question any other

1336
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:09,880
questions I popped up for that you want

1337
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:13,660
to ask each other you're worried that I

1338
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:19,019
cannot respond to that answer for all

1339
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:19,019
the same reasons at one plus one
