0:00:29.340,0:00:35.489
all right let's see what we've got what

0:00:34.020,0:00:41.730
do you remember from the first time we

0:00:35.489,0:00:46.250
met the first time we met was at my

0:00:41.730,0:00:48.540
college at least and I was setting up

0:00:46.250,0:00:54.780
chairs and I think he thought I was a

0:00:48.540,0:01:00.120
janitor I was wearing sweat pants and

0:00:54.780,0:01:02.780
was not prepared to set up your life

0:01:00.120,0:01:08.700
presence out of my life or meet you and

0:01:02.780,0:01:13.200
I wasn't really interested in meeting

0:01:08.700,0:01:15.060
anyone and kind of just went from there

0:01:13.200,0:01:17.430
all I really remember was talking about

0:01:15.060,0:01:21.000
Taylor Swift and talking about how guys

0:01:17.430,0:01:24.240
love when the bass drops in that song

0:01:21.000,0:01:26.850
that sounded like the goats I knew you

0:01:24.240,0:01:29.280
were trouble yeah that's really all I

0:01:26.850,0:01:32.460
remember from the first time that we

0:01:29.280,0:01:34.200
read I remember the next time we met a

0:01:32.460,0:01:35.880
little bit better heard a real first

0:01:34.200,0:01:36.719
song that I talked about but a good

0:01:35.880,0:01:41.009
first impression

0:01:36.719,0:01:43.039
okay first impression what do you

0:01:41.009,0:01:45.899
remember about the first time we met I

0:01:43.039,0:01:47.700
think probably about the same as you I

0:01:45.899,0:01:48.749
mean I didn't I certainly don't think

0:01:47.700,0:01:50.369
either of us wanted to have any

0:01:48.749,0:01:53.490
expectation of meeting somebody you

0:01:50.369,0:01:55.229
liked in a romantic way but I remember

0:01:53.490,0:01:57.119
being happy I was there because there

0:01:55.229,0:02:00.420
was a blizzard outside nothing one shows

0:01:57.119,0:02:01.560
to happen and this meeting I'm talking

0:02:00.420,0:02:03.090
to you before the show I thought you're

0:02:01.560,0:02:04.170
cool but I kind of dismissed it as like

0:02:03.090,0:02:07.020
well that's something that I'm not going

0:02:04.170,0:02:09.270
to meet again don't use nice I think

0:02:07.020,0:02:11.580
that's the truth you know I don't think

0:02:09.270,0:02:15.060
they either of us really thought we

0:02:11.580,0:02:17.720
would encounter each other all this all

0:02:15.060,0:02:17.720
this business

0:02:18.890,0:02:33.530
okay list your top three memories we've

0:02:23.570,0:02:36.800
had together well I mean I would say

0:02:33.530,0:02:39.950
probably the obvious one is us getting

0:02:36.800,0:02:42.260
engaged but I want to work I would say

0:02:39.950,0:02:44.840
the first would be spending that whole

0:02:42.260,0:02:46.640
first weekend together the week after we

0:02:44.840,0:02:48.650
met because that was kind of where it

0:02:46.640,0:02:50.390
went from like oh here's this person I

0:02:48.650,0:02:52.730
was I didn't think I was gonna be ever

0:02:50.390,0:02:54.530
again - all of a sudden now we're

0:02:52.730,0:02:56.840
hanging out we have this chemistry and

0:02:54.530,0:02:58.430
this is really exciting but I think even

0:02:56.840,0:03:00.500
leaving that weekend neither of us

0:02:58.430,0:03:01.520
really knew what was going to happen but

0:03:00.500,0:03:02.989
it was the first time in a long time

0:03:01.520,0:03:09.350
that I was like really excited about

0:03:02.989,0:03:12.380
something I think well the third one is

0:03:09.350,0:03:16.370
the engagement which I'll get to I think

0:03:12.380,0:03:19.250
number two is probably it's probably

0:03:16.370,0:03:21.170
gonna grafting with you the first summer

0:03:19.250,0:03:22.459
we were together when we I had never

0:03:21.170,0:03:25.160
gone away water rafting I was very

0:03:22.459,0:03:27.920
nervous about that yeah very very

0:03:25.160,0:03:29.390
nervous I had all sorts of visions of me

0:03:27.920,0:03:33.380
getting my head against a rocket and

0:03:29.390,0:03:34.850
that being the end of it but that was

0:03:33.380,0:03:36.320
one of those times where I just felt

0:03:34.850,0:03:37.790
like we've been a that's like maybe like

0:03:36.320,0:03:38.230
three or four months at that point and

0:03:37.790,0:03:40.930
then

0:03:38.230,0:03:43.950
that was the first time that I realized

0:03:40.930,0:03:48.580
how much fun I had with you all the time

0:03:43.950,0:03:51.640
and also how adept a ten year old kid is

0:03:48.580,0:03:53.769
at setting up the tents conveyances

0:03:51.640,0:03:56.470
leaving a basically flat intent for the

0:03:53.769,0:03:58.959
first night but the third the third and

0:03:56.470,0:04:01.330
most important one is definitely us

0:03:58.959,0:04:03.160
getting engaged because I thought the

0:04:01.330,0:04:04.870
weirdest part to me still is that I

0:04:03.160,0:04:06.430
thought you knew what was coming because

0:04:04.870,0:04:07.870
we had talked about like what kind of

0:04:06.430,0:04:09.879
ring do you want like this is something

0:04:07.870,0:04:13.180
that's somewhat imminent and might

0:04:09.879,0:04:14.829
happen and then when we're going up to

0:04:13.180,0:04:17.889
your parents house that morning and you

0:04:14.829,0:04:20.410
specifically said offhandedly like don't

0:04:17.889,0:04:22.300
ever surprise me with the proposal

0:04:20.410,0:04:24.010
because I was making fun of you for

0:04:22.300,0:04:25.240
always watching the end of reality shows

0:04:24.010,0:04:27.930
before you watch the beginning because

0:04:25.240,0:04:31.090
you don't get to attach the characters

0:04:27.930,0:04:33.250
that I kind of threw me up and then the

0:04:31.090,0:04:35.560
longest day that I've ever experienced

0:04:33.250,0:04:37.090
continued where it was ten hours of me

0:04:35.560,0:04:40.000
literally not listening to anything you

0:04:37.090,0:04:42.639
were saying but the fact that it took me

0:04:40.000,0:04:44.770
taking a ring out and your entire family

0:04:42.639,0:04:47.710
knowing what's going on before you

0:04:44.770,0:04:50.440
realized and then you swearing in front

0:04:47.710,0:04:55.150
of your grandmother I don't know if I

0:04:50.440,0:04:56.900
can swear here but it was great all

0:04:55.150,0:05:00.090
right

0:04:56.900,0:05:02.130
you could swear by the way okay well in

0:05:00.090,0:05:04.470
that case she said holy fuck in front of

0:05:02.130,0:05:07.690
her 86 year old grandmother was

0:05:04.470,0:05:10.740
phenomenal I don't think you a bad news

0:05:07.690,0:05:10.740
[Music]

0:05:11.750,0:05:18.320
all right well this how that goes right

0:05:13.860,0:05:20.580
into that why did you want to marry me

0:05:18.320,0:05:24.510
there are a lot of reasons I wanted to

0:05:20.580,0:05:26.610
marry you I think that one of the main

0:05:24.510,0:05:28.590
reasons that I wanted to marry you and

0:05:26.610,0:05:32.040
still want to marry or because we get

0:05:28.590,0:05:34.650
along so seamlessly I think that when we

0:05:32.040,0:05:36.980
talk about it and when people ask us you

0:05:34.650,0:05:39.870
know what you argue about it or what you

0:05:36.980,0:05:41.610
know what do you guys talk about theater

0:05:39.870,0:05:44.190
why do you guys get along or really just

0:05:41.610,0:05:45.900
any of those reasons there are so many

0:05:44.190,0:05:47.190
things and so many reasons that we

0:05:45.900,0:05:48.480
shouldn't be together it's so many

0:05:47.190,0:05:51.270
things that shouldn't have brought us

0:05:48.480,0:05:53.070
together and so many things that like

0:05:51.270,0:05:54.840
should have happened to push us apart

0:05:53.070,0:05:57.360
yeah it'll be the long distance for a

0:05:54.840,0:06:00.030
year and a half and I was still in

0:05:57.360,0:06:03.450
college I mean that and we could have

0:06:00.030,0:06:06.900
broken up so many times in there and

0:06:03.450,0:06:10.410
thanks for really hard for so long but

0:06:06.900,0:06:11.900
like through all of that time and not to

0:06:10.410,0:06:14.370
say that things weren't hard and like

0:06:11.900,0:06:16.290
there were probably times that we both

0:06:14.370,0:06:19.140
questions whether or not we're making

0:06:16.290,0:06:21.210
the right decision but like through all

0:06:19.140,0:06:22.980
of that and just seems so clear at the

0:06:21.210,0:06:26.490
end of it that you're the person that I

0:06:22.980,0:06:28.670
was supposed to be with it and it was

0:06:26.490,0:06:31.530
crazy because moving down to New York

0:06:28.670,0:06:33.390
didn't even seem like a big deal like

0:06:31.530,0:06:34.590
moving from me into New York it was like

0:06:33.390,0:06:36.230
no big deal

0:06:34.590,0:06:39.030
moving in together

0:06:36.230,0:06:40.980
I mean it's so minted leading up to it

0:06:39.030,0:06:42.419
but actually once we once that happen

0:06:40.980,0:06:44.820
you know yeah but now that we live

0:06:42.419,0:06:46.560
together it's like no big deal well it

0:06:44.820,0:06:48.240
was like we move in together and nothing

0:06:46.560,0:06:52.979
changed right I didn't even notice it

0:06:48.240,0:06:56.280
almost right well no but I think I feel

0:06:52.979,0:06:59.190
like the only struggles we ever had were

0:06:56.280,0:07:01.590
due to outside factors like any time

0:06:59.190,0:07:06.360
yeah you and I being together was always

0:07:01.590,0:07:07.710
really easy yeah I also think that the

0:07:06.360,0:07:09.450
fact that we just wanted to seed a

0:07:07.710,0:07:11.340
little more and didn't have the ability

0:07:09.450,0:07:13.560
to I think so makes us appreciate each

0:07:11.340,0:07:15.090
other more now and I think of whatever

0:07:13.560,0:07:16.950
if we had just started dating and we

0:07:15.090,0:07:18.630
lived in the same city and moved in

0:07:16.950,0:07:20.880
after two months of some people did I

0:07:18.630,0:07:22.620
also I think that right from the

0:07:20.880,0:07:25.800
beginning one of the biggest things

0:07:22.620,0:07:28.710
about you is I've had such an inherent

0:07:25.800,0:07:30.960
level of trust in you I've never ever

0:07:28.710,0:07:35.100
damaged you like ever I have always

0:07:30.960,0:07:37.380
known that no matter what I could always

0:07:35.100,0:07:40.380
know that you've had my back

0:07:37.380,0:07:42.000
like most people and long-distance

0:07:40.380,0:07:44.760
relationships would not be able to be

0:07:42.000,0:07:47.520
like oh yeah well that's my boyfriend

0:07:44.760,0:07:49.470
this median through Charles around to

0:07:47.520,0:07:53.370
different colleges where he also met me

0:07:49.470,0:07:55.979
College Sutan where he also met me at a

0:07:53.370,0:07:57.870
party you know and all of a sudden like

0:07:55.979,0:07:59.700
how are you supposed to trust him like

0:07:57.870,0:08:01.410
that but just it was almost unspoken

0:07:59.700,0:08:03.599
that we just inherently trusted each

0:08:01.410,0:08:05.880
other and having that right from the

0:08:03.599,0:08:10.229
beginning was so important I think both

0:08:05.880,0:08:13.260
of us growing together and obviously you

0:08:10.229,0:08:16.380
know that's core and communication is

0:08:13.260,0:08:19.440
cooler listening his car yeah anytime

0:08:16.380,0:08:23.389
your long-distance and you if you don't

0:08:19.440,0:08:23.389
have trust in that situation you're done

0:08:25.979,0:08:29.669
that's what I wanna marry you

0:08:30.270,0:08:39.700
how do you describe me to others I don't

0:08:37.810,0:08:40.630
know that it comes up that much I feel

0:08:39.700,0:08:44.670
like that's a weird thing to say but

0:08:40.630,0:08:48.490
like in that direct of a form it like I

0:08:44.670,0:08:50.050
guess I'm thinking of how well when I

0:08:48.490,0:08:53.339
first described you to my parents

0:08:50.050,0:08:53.339
let's start with that because I think

0:08:53.399,0:08:57.399
because of the fact that there was the

0:08:55.570,0:08:59.440
age difference and not even that eight

0:08:57.399,0:09:00.310
times but four and a half years which is

0:08:59.440,0:09:01.570
not a big deal

0:09:00.310,0:09:02.649
in the grand scheme of things but the

0:09:01.570,0:09:04.570
fact that you were at college at the

0:09:02.649,0:09:07.029
time I think when I would describe you

0:09:04.570,0:09:08.740
of people especially early on it would

0:09:07.029,0:09:10.510
be me having to like justify it and

0:09:08.740,0:09:12.850
probably you to the same extent of like

0:09:10.510,0:09:15.310
are you dating this touring example

0:09:12.850,0:09:17.230
meaningful lives in New York but when I

0:09:15.310,0:09:18.910
told my parents that I the you and I

0:09:17.230,0:09:21.760
were dating and that you were still in

0:09:18.910,0:09:25.390
college I think they immediately judged

0:09:21.760,0:09:27.579
well what kind of person you were which

0:09:25.390,0:09:29.440
I understand because a lot of 21 year

0:09:27.579,0:09:31.029
old college girls are not the most

0:09:29.440,0:09:32.680
mature people in the world I don't think

0:09:31.029,0:09:35.440
a lot of people in college are but the

0:09:32.680,0:09:38.140
thing I was stressed was that it never I

0:09:35.440,0:09:41.350
heard I had to remind myself and I self

0:09:38.140,0:09:44.110
remind remind yourself how young you are

0:09:41.350,0:09:46.240
relatively because I've never gotten

0:09:44.110,0:09:47.829
that vibe from you like I feel like in a

0:09:46.240,0:09:49.839
lot of ways you're a lot more mature

0:09:47.829,0:09:53.230
than I am a lot more mature than a lot

0:09:49.839,0:09:55.899
of people in their 40s and that's either

0:09:53.230,0:09:57.790
your personality or just a combination

0:09:55.899,0:10:00.070
your personality and the fact that

0:09:57.790,0:10:03.550
you've had to kind of be the adult a lot

0:10:00.070,0:10:04.440
of situations with your family and stuff

0:10:03.550,0:10:05.370
growing up and that

0:10:04.440,0:10:06.720
and I feel like you've always had to

0:10:05.370,0:10:08.639
take a lot of responsibility and

0:10:06.720,0:10:13.649
therefore you didn't have the luxury of

0:10:08.639,0:10:15.300
like goofing around but yeah I mean I

0:10:13.649,0:10:17.009
think that was kind of the way I

0:10:15.300,0:10:18.899
conveyed to my parents to let them know

0:10:17.009,0:10:22.680
like I'm not something like creep and

0:10:18.899,0:10:25.139
she's not so maybe it and what I told

0:10:22.680,0:10:29.550
them well I told my friends about you it

0:10:25.139,0:10:31.379
was just I think the thing that I said

0:10:29.550,0:10:34.110
that most often was that it just like it

0:10:31.379,0:10:37.079
felt different and I hadn't felt that

0:10:34.110,0:10:40.050
way about anybody in a long time and

0:10:37.079,0:10:42.990
then and then ever you know maybe like

0:10:40.050,0:10:45.449
as things progressed it was clear to me

0:10:42.990,0:10:46.860
that what you and I had going out was

0:10:45.449,0:10:48.600
something that I hadn't had with anybody

0:10:46.860,0:10:51.060
else and I think you always are

0:10:48.600,0:10:53.069
comparing it a relationship to whatever

0:10:51.060,0:10:55.410
the best relationship you think you had

0:10:53.069,0:10:56.850
in the past was and then all of sudden

0:10:55.410,0:10:58.110
that surpasses it and you're like oh I

0:10:56.850,0:11:01.139
guess I don't have to be hung up on that

0:10:58.110,0:11:03.779
anymore so yeah I think just as somebody

0:11:01.139,0:11:15.959
who's kind didn't mature and someone who

0:11:03.779,0:11:18.720
I have what is similar and different so

0:11:15.959,0:11:21.180
similar I definitely say that in a lot

0:11:18.720,0:11:23.759
of ways were on you know the same

0:11:21.180,0:11:26.130
wavelength when it comes to you know

0:11:23.759,0:11:28.889
what we care about how we sort of like

0:11:26.130,0:11:32.040
approach life like pretty even-keeled

0:11:28.889,0:11:34.860
people you know don't like to go out too

0:11:32.040,0:11:37.920
much which I also like value you

0:11:34.860,0:11:41.040
obviously got a 92 but that's certainly

0:11:37.920,0:11:43.199
a job but you know I think that we have

0:11:41.040,0:11:46.769
the same approach to a lot of different

0:11:43.199,0:11:48.750
issues and you know we don't we're just

0:11:46.769,0:11:53.550
kind of calm people I like that about us

0:11:48.750,0:11:56.699
I don't really know how I mean I don't

0:11:53.550,0:11:59.189
know how we're different that's probably

0:11:56.699,0:11:59.980
something I should well I mean not

0:11:59.189,0:12:01.900
necessarily

0:11:59.980,0:12:05.650
we certainly are a lot more similar than

0:12:01.900,0:12:07.420
we are different obviously our lives are

0:12:05.650,0:12:09.670
incredibly different but yeah well

0:12:07.420,0:12:18.760
that's kind of like the biggest thing I

0:12:09.670,0:12:23.140
mean obviously I work all day so that

0:12:18.760,0:12:25.000
would probably be a person I mean that's

0:12:23.140,0:12:27.460
the thing because it's one thing to tell

0:12:25.000,0:12:30.850
people like why you're interested in

0:12:27.460,0:12:32.740
somebody but the first time you you see

0:12:30.850,0:12:34.870
something with that person I think tells

0:12:32.740,0:12:36.580
you a lot and to me I've always had a

0:12:34.870,0:12:38.290
good feel for that like when I see my

0:12:36.580,0:12:39.700
friends with the new grill of their date

0:12:38.290,0:12:41.530
like whether or not it's probably going

0:12:39.700,0:12:44.530
to work out and I think when people saw

0:12:41.530,0:12:45.910
us together that was the comment that we

0:12:44.530,0:12:46.990
got more than anything else was like it

0:12:45.910,0:12:48.850
seems like you two were just like locked

0:12:46.990,0:12:52.060
in in terms of just being on the same

0:12:48.850,0:12:56.440
wavelength in terms of not not only like

0:12:52.060,0:12:58.120
sense of humor and personality but just

0:12:56.440,0:12:59.950
basically had a person I am the fact

0:12:58.120,0:13:02.170
that I'm sarcastic and I like to make

0:12:59.950,0:13:03.220
references to obscure things a lot of

0:13:02.170,0:13:05.290
people were their friends their

0:13:03.220,0:13:06.730
girlfriends or anybody felt kind of

0:13:05.290,0:13:08.110
alone for the rock that we know that

0:13:06.730,0:13:10.600
I'll talk about but I feel like you and

0:13:08.110,0:13:13.330
I both kind of bounce off each other and

0:13:10.600,0:13:16.120
I mean we are kind of like a comedy duo

0:13:13.330,0:13:22.780
amongst our friends in a way of just

0:13:16.120,0:13:25.420
like something that we can work towards

0:13:22.780,0:13:29.590
yeah I think about Stephanie a big

0:13:25.420,0:13:30.160
differences you know the day job paint

0:13:29.590,0:13:34.360
job

0:13:30.160,0:13:35.890
well and also what like I think here's

0:13:34.360,0:13:37.420
somebody who and obviously we've talked

0:13:35.890,0:13:40.990
about it before like you're much more

0:13:37.420,0:13:44.140
oriented towards small town than a city

0:13:40.990,0:13:46.720
house over the park of the yard or not a

0:13:44.140,0:13:50.290
car and I think that's a byproduct the

0:13:46.720,0:13:51.490
way you grew up but you know that's

0:13:50.290,0:13:53.470
something that you've been willing to

0:13:51.490,0:13:55.360
compromise for the time being but I

0:13:53.470,0:13:57.640
think that in terms of like what we

0:13:55.360,0:13:59.560
value obviously the things that matter

0:13:57.640,0:14:02.140
in terms of family and what we believe

0:13:59.560,0:14:03.550
in a line but in terms of what be like

0:14:02.140,0:14:04.620
where we envision ourselves living at

0:14:03.550,0:14:07.830
that kind of thing I think that's

0:14:04.620,0:14:13.180
probably been one of the only sources of

0:14:07.830,0:14:17.170
my car yeah we'll deal with it another

0:14:13.180,0:14:33.040
day or ten years or five years or three

0:14:17.170,0:14:36.300
years when we move back to me why are

0:14:33.040,0:14:36.300
you hesitant to tell me

0:14:39.139,0:14:45.230
I mean I think we're pretty open with

0:14:41.389,0:14:49.879
each other about most things I think

0:14:45.230,0:14:53.179
sometimes I'm hesitant to tell you like

0:14:49.879,0:14:56.240
what my fears are regarding my future

0:14:53.179,0:14:58.040
and as a result our future like then you

0:14:56.240,0:15:01.189
self doubt that I have regarding my

0:14:58.040,0:15:02.509
chosen career or whether or not I think

0:15:01.189,0:15:04.490
everything's in the pan now they try to

0:15:02.509,0:15:07.879
I kind of try to keep that to myself as

0:15:04.490,0:15:10.069
I know earlier I was I feel like I was a

0:15:07.879,0:15:12.170
lot more negative that I have now about

0:15:10.069,0:15:13.939
how things were going for me and I think

0:15:12.170,0:15:17.300
that affected our relationship the times

0:15:13.939,0:15:18.949
of me letting that negativity or not

0:15:17.300,0:15:20.480
being able to separate like I feel

0:15:18.949,0:15:23.059
shitty about the show that I've just did

0:15:20.480,0:15:25.399
so I'm gonna bring that over again for

0:15:23.059,0:15:27.379
the conversation that I have with you so

0:15:25.399,0:15:30.800
I think I try to kind of tamper that

0:15:27.379,0:15:33.110
down when I'm able to and I don't I

0:15:30.800,0:15:35.269
don't feel that way as much anymore but

0:15:33.110,0:15:37.639
there are times where I feel like I'm

0:15:35.269,0:15:39.589
gonna sulk and I just kind of do that on

0:15:37.639,0:15:44.119
my own on the train that I kind of let

0:15:39.589,0:15:46.220
it go that's how I get sacks well but

0:15:44.119,0:15:48.740
it's not you know I think if there's any

0:15:46.220,0:15:50.029
this situation where I'm upset I mean it

0:15:48.740,0:15:52.429
just happened this weekend where I feel

0:15:50.029,0:15:54.949
like I sure didn't go well like I'll

0:15:52.429,0:15:56.360
always talk to you about that because I

0:15:54.949,0:15:57.619
know not only that you're gonna listen

0:15:56.360,0:16:01.759
to me but you're gonna make me feel

0:15:57.619,0:16:04.369
better about it but I also don't want to

0:16:01.759,0:16:05.689
argue with that because I work in a

0:16:04.369,0:16:07.579
field where there's a lot of rejection

0:16:05.689,0:16:09.350
and negativity I did that every time I

0:16:07.579,0:16:10.580
was upset about something you guys

0:16:09.350,0:16:15.570
really

0:16:10.580,0:16:17.130
wimp so I don't know I mean in terms of

0:16:15.570,0:16:20.760
other stuff that I have medicine to tell

0:16:17.130,0:16:23.070
you lay it all out there I don't know I

0:16:20.760,0:16:25.230
mean I think we've we've gone out of our

0:16:23.070,0:16:27.270
way to talk about like people we've

0:16:25.230,0:16:29.820
dated and past relationships and that

0:16:27.270,0:16:32.070
sort of thing because I think it really

0:16:29.820,0:16:33.450
matters anymore like I know I feel like

0:16:32.070,0:16:35.010
neither of us were really coming out

0:16:33.450,0:16:37.010
like oh I just don't wanna hear about

0:16:35.010,0:16:39.260
anybody that you've been with this I

0:16:37.010,0:16:41.580
feel like it's a little unhealthy

0:16:39.260,0:16:43.080
honestly when people have this weird

0:16:41.580,0:16:44.850
mindset of like oh well we're together

0:16:43.080,0:16:47.180
now so let's pretend that neither of us

0:16:44.850,0:16:50.100
have ever been with anybody else before

0:16:47.180,0:16:52.590
if anything I think that's probably not

0:16:50.100,0:16:54.030
really the best approach but I don't

0:16:52.590,0:16:55.950
know I think we're pretty forthcoming

0:16:54.030,0:17:00.090
with each other are there things that

0:16:55.950,0:17:01.380
you like actively keep from me I mean I

0:17:00.090,0:17:02.730
think it goes to what we were saying

0:17:01.380,0:17:04.740
before about the difference in this

0:17:02.730,0:17:09.390
where it's like every time I feel like

0:17:04.740,0:17:11.250
oh okay homesickness to move back out of

0:17:09.390,0:17:14.130
the city or like every time I hear a

0:17:11.250,0:17:16.290
freaking car horn like can I just move

0:17:14.130,0:17:18.840
back to a place that doesn't have car

0:17:16.290,0:17:20.280
horns or you know a place where people

0:17:18.840,0:17:21.840
aren't yelling at each other all the

0:17:20.280,0:17:24.900
time or you don't have to take the

0:17:21.840,0:17:26.910
subway we'll don't sit on top of you or

0:17:24.900,0:17:29.790
stink all the time like lips or nose

0:17:26.910,0:17:32.520
clip their nails a public place like not

0:17:29.790,0:17:36.130
a lot of that mean there isn't and you

0:17:32.520,0:17:39.520
know when I think about raising a fan

0:17:36.130,0:17:42.790
getting married a lot of like my fears

0:17:39.520,0:17:45.550
around raising a family in the city come

0:17:42.790,0:17:49.000
up but I feel like where you don't tell

0:17:45.550,0:17:51.610
me all the time when you have a bad name

0:17:49.000,0:17:53.950
to show when I think about our future

0:17:51.610,0:17:56.620
together in New York I get really

0:17:53.950,0:17:59.650
nervous about living here forever yeah

0:17:56.620,0:18:01.480
when we talk about buying a place in New

0:17:59.650,0:18:04.450
York like wow that seems like an awesome

0:18:01.480,0:18:07.150
idea it also seems like tying us really

0:18:04.450,0:18:09.220
really deeply to New York and while

0:18:07.150,0:18:12.280
we're young that's awesome and it also

0:18:09.220,0:18:17.020
it's such a tough thing because you're

0:18:12.280,0:18:18.880
so tied to here with your job and I

0:18:17.020,0:18:20.470
could literally be anywhere as long as I

0:18:18.880,0:18:23.230
have my computer like I could literally

0:18:20.470,0:18:26.580
anywhere and that's what makes it so

0:18:23.230,0:18:29.800
tough to feel like I can always be like

0:18:26.580,0:18:33.190
you know super honest about where would

0:18:29.800,0:18:35.410
be or you know how I totally see my

0:18:33.190,0:18:38.920
future with well I feel like even if we

0:18:35.410,0:18:40.360
don't say it in specific terms we both

0:18:38.920,0:18:43.060
kind of have an understanding and an

0:18:40.360,0:18:45.220
agreement that like this is where I need

0:18:43.060,0:18:46.600
to be now and this is where we're

0:18:45.220,0:18:49.000
probably going to be for the foreseeable

0:18:46.600,0:18:51.310
future whether that's three years for

0:18:49.000,0:18:53.260
five years or seven years but that we

0:18:51.310,0:18:55.780
both agree that we don't want to raise

0:18:53.260,0:18:56.980
kids here and like live here forever but

0:18:55.780,0:19:01.450
I also know that that's tough when

0:18:56.980,0:19:03.640
there's not a like it I wish that there

0:19:01.450,0:19:04.930
were a scenario where I could say it's

0:19:03.640,0:19:08.820
going to take me five years to

0:19:04.930,0:19:08.820
accomplish XYZ that

0:19:08.990,0:19:13.140
anywhere and I'll just fly over

0:19:11.429,0:19:15.090
everybody even that sort of thing but

0:19:13.140,0:19:18.450
you know we know the best reality

0:19:15.090,0:19:19.200
situation I guess that's why how's it

0:19:18.450,0:19:29.190
Asami

0:19:19.200,0:19:45.090
yeah alright what privileges do you

0:19:29.190,0:19:48.570
think well recently but other than being

0:19:45.090,0:20:00.690
me is generally generally like what to

0:19:48.570,0:20:03.419
take for granted I mean just I guess

0:20:00.690,0:20:06.419
within I feel like I'm talking about

0:20:03.419,0:20:09.090
like comedy specifically but you know I

0:20:06.419,0:20:11.820
get really frustrated with going to your

0:20:09.090,0:20:14.190
shows mostly because I get frustrated

0:20:11.820,0:20:17.429
with many comedy specifically and I

0:20:14.190,0:20:19.590
think that if we're talking like this I

0:20:17.429,0:20:24.030
think I think that you erased me to

0:20:19.590,0:20:26.790
family where you were brought up to be

0:20:24.030,0:20:30.450
very conscious and conscientious person

0:20:26.790,0:20:34.049
about gender and your sister and mother

0:20:30.450,0:20:37.770
and father are very smart people who I

0:20:34.049,0:20:42.210
think are very aware of the way they

0:20:37.770,0:20:44.640
raised you to drew people home I go to

0:20:42.210,0:20:48.419
shows I get really frustrated because I

0:20:44.640,0:20:49.759
see a lot of like 95% guys and then

0:20:48.419,0:20:53.279
you're out of the show as always like

0:20:49.759,0:20:57.059
the girl talking about like the period

0:20:53.279,0:20:58.950
jokes and her moves and so it's been

0:20:57.059,0:21:01.859
tough for me to like go your shows

0:20:58.950,0:21:05.009
because I then complain to you after

0:21:01.859,0:21:09.090
about like the discrepancies in comedy

0:21:05.009,0:21:11.970
where it's like all you know 150 men

0:21:09.090,0:21:17.279
doing this and then one woman doing this

0:21:11.970,0:21:20.789
and then it's like why because just

0:21:17.279,0:21:24.509
numbers-wise it's a tie or side to man

0:21:20.789,0:21:26.429
versus and then I mean that's how for

0:21:24.509,0:21:27.059
you just to say we like travel on your

0:21:26.429,0:21:30.690
own

0:21:27.059,0:21:32.820
yeah but I don't know I don't think you

0:21:30.690,0:21:38.549
specifically take a lot of things for

0:21:32.820,0:21:47.299
granted I don't know you don't really

0:21:38.549,0:21:53.059
walk around like some man's shirt man

0:21:47.299,0:21:53.059
you know like there's some guys just on

0:22:00.259,0:22:06.179
one of this and you know exactly who I'm

0:22:03.539,0:22:07.649
talking about the way I'm talking about

0:22:06.179,0:22:10.950
these has to be well because I I could

0:22:07.649,0:22:16.399
not be engaged to someone who was this

0:22:10.950,0:22:20.220
stereotypical tango guy who was the rich

0:22:16.399,0:22:22.350
leave information maybe just a person of

0:22:20.220,0:22:24.359
certain race of a certain class who

0:22:22.350,0:22:26.159
works a certain job with warship types

0:22:24.359,0:22:34.169
of gloves that fins or a really certain

0:22:26.159,0:22:35.840
stereotype person yeah yeah and you

0:22:34.169,0:22:42.700
don't exert yourself like that

0:22:35.840,0:22:42.700
yeah good

0:22:45.929,0:22:57.279
that's your earliest political memory I

0:22:55.049,0:22:59.259
mean I think the first thing that I

0:22:57.279,0:23:02.409
really remember being aware of was the

0:22:59.259,0:23:04.659
Lewinsky thing because I was like 10 and

0:23:02.409,0:23:08.700
that was all anybody talked about for a

0:23:04.659,0:23:11.379
year and so I don't think it was ever

0:23:08.700,0:23:13.210
really explained to me what that like

0:23:11.379,0:23:14.979
what exactly was going on absolutely

0:23:13.210,0:23:17.710
never enough that my parents didn't

0:23:14.979,0:23:19.419
really feel like tackling the oral sex

0:23:17.710,0:23:20.619
is there anything oral sex conversation

0:23:19.419,0:23:21.419
I don't think that happens with kissing

0:23:20.619,0:23:24.879
parents

0:23:21.419,0:23:27.220
conversation yeah so I don't know that

0:23:24.879,0:23:28.869
you know because it's hard to really be

0:23:27.220,0:23:31.269
politically aware as a little kid other

0:23:28.869,0:23:32.739
than like knowing that important things

0:23:31.269,0:23:34.720
happen in the world like I remember when

0:23:32.739,0:23:38.080
the Oklahoma City bombing things like

0:23:34.720,0:23:41.320
that that's more world something in

0:23:38.080,0:23:44.190
politics but yeah Clinton is the first

0:23:41.320,0:23:46.720
president that I remember distinctly and

0:23:44.190,0:23:50.229
we you know my parents were both

0:23:46.720,0:23:53.139
Democrats and so they liked Clinton but

0:23:50.229,0:23:55.119
they're also fairly I think wasn't prude

0:23:53.139,0:23:57.999
but they're pretty traditional and so

0:23:55.119,0:23:59.159
one thing with what was he happy I think

0:23:57.999,0:24:01.570
they were very this

0:23:59.159,0:24:04.390
like well he's just confirming what

0:24:01.570,0:24:07.390
we've all thought about politics for you

0:24:04.390,0:24:09.039
know all the time basically this even

0:24:07.390,0:24:10.769
before that you kind of got the vibe

0:24:09.039,0:24:13.899
from him then he was this like very

0:24:10.769,0:24:17.620
slick talking kind of like smarmy guy

0:24:13.899,0:24:20.049
who he knew he was very meticulous with

0:24:17.620,0:24:23.470
how he was talking to people and

0:24:20.049,0:24:25.750
somebody pulling on running so it was

0:24:23.470,0:24:28.809
hard going to the 90s was nice because

0:24:25.750,0:24:30.429
everything was going so well you know

0:24:28.809,0:24:31.990
but I feel like I've said this to you

0:24:30.429,0:24:33.639
before I think the nineties were like

0:24:31.990,0:24:36.460
our version of the 50s it was this time

0:24:33.639,0:24:38.169
that everybody was back on now like I

0:24:36.460,0:24:40.149
say the best time I heard was making

0:24:38.169,0:24:42.970
those money and it was the best choice

0:24:40.149,0:24:45.850
and there's always a and weird feeling

0:24:42.970,0:24:48.100
around nostalgia when you grow up yeah I

0:24:45.850,0:24:49.210
think politically that's the first thing

0:24:48.100,0:24:53.320
that I really remember and then

0:24:49.210,0:24:56.830
obviously the defining moment of my

0:24:53.320,0:24:59.789
childhood is 9/11 which I mean it's hard

0:24:56.830,0:25:02.470
to not enter to find out of politics I

0:24:59.789,0:25:04.960
mean that was my fourth day of high

0:25:02.470,0:25:06.820
school and I lived in New Jersey so

0:25:04.960,0:25:10.480
there were people who knew people who

0:25:06.820,0:25:12.370
were there and I think that's the first

0:25:10.480,0:25:13.750
time I really like took an interest in

0:25:12.370,0:25:15.340
what was going out of the world because

0:25:13.750,0:25:18.399
you couldn't ignore it anymore

0:25:15.340,0:25:21.240
like I still remember the day after that

0:25:18.399,0:25:23.320
happened when we were in homeroom and

0:25:21.240,0:25:25.210
they had us do the Pledge of Allegiance

0:25:23.320,0:25:26.590
and nobody could get through it like it

0:25:25.210,0:25:27.940
makes me choked up now think about this

0:25:26.590,0:25:29.470
is something you've recited since you

0:25:27.940,0:25:32.200
were five without ever thinking about

0:25:29.470,0:25:33.700
the context of it and then all of a

0:25:32.200,0:25:36.610
sudden that we got this different

0:25:33.700,0:25:39.560
meaning so yeah I think that probably is

0:25:36.610,0:25:48.500
the whiskey thing and then obviously

0:25:39.560,0:25:50.570
the world change living how do you think

0:25:48.500,0:25:54.560
I was influenced by growing up as a

0:25:50.570,0:25:55.520
first-generation American and what would

0:25:54.560,0:26:00.710
you change

0:25:55.520,0:26:03.590
I don't that means what what I change is

0:26:00.710,0:26:06.740
that for me maybe I'm s to myself doing

0:26:03.590,0:26:08.210
it well well how do you think I was I

0:26:06.740,0:26:10.490
was influenced by growing I was the

0:26:08.210,0:26:14.590
first generation in America well I think

0:26:10.490,0:26:19.640
that one of the interesting things about

0:26:14.590,0:26:23.240
talking to your dad and listening to him

0:26:19.640,0:26:26.630
and just sort of watching him obviously

0:26:23.240,0:26:29.960
you know me I know most of my life like

0:26:26.630,0:26:32.810
observing people and if I can do mostly

0:26:29.960,0:26:36.830
observing and less talking I'm a happier

0:26:32.810,0:26:40.510
person but watching your dad he's a

0:26:36.830,0:26:45.200
really fascinating guy he's always

0:26:40.510,0:26:50.480
thinking about ways that he can better

0:26:45.200,0:26:54.500
himself save money and help you guys and

0:26:50.480,0:26:59.690
I think those are three qualities that

0:26:54.500,0:27:03.290
you have taken in and that he's not your

0:26:59.690,0:27:05.390
mom as well and I think that we're gonna

0:27:03.290,0:27:08.180
happen potentially in the hallway family

0:27:05.390,0:27:10.120
like I did yeah not that my parents

0:27:08.180,0:27:13.100
didn't instill some of those qualities

0:27:10.120,0:27:15.260
but thinking about money and the ways

0:27:13.100,0:27:17.630
that he does not you know a thing

0:27:15.260,0:27:19.700
we think about like if my mom wants to

0:27:17.630,0:27:22.580
buy something it's like did it let's

0:27:19.700,0:27:24.799
imagine I absolutely machine buy better

0:27:22.580,0:27:26.870
polar opposites in terms of you know she

0:27:24.799,0:27:28.040
doesn't really think about what she's

0:27:26.870,0:27:32.600
spending her what she's spending it on

0:27:28.040,0:27:35.690
whereas my dad completely invest you

0:27:32.600,0:27:37.370
know when you grow up with nothing I see

0:27:35.690,0:27:39.049
then you go one of two directions you

0:27:37.370,0:27:40.280
either over adult everybody and buy all

0:27:39.049,0:27:43.640
the things that you wish you could have

0:27:40.280,0:27:46.309
had or you go in his direction which is

0:27:43.640,0:27:48.770
being so overly frugal that you can't

0:27:46.309,0:27:50.929
even fully enjoy the money that you've

0:27:48.770,0:27:53.870
made and it kind of I mean he's occupied

0:27:50.929,0:27:55.010
like he's what almost six years old and

0:27:53.870,0:27:57.020
I don't think a day goes by where he

0:27:55.010,0:27:59.780
doesn't think about money in some

0:27:57.020,0:28:01.309
capacity and it's because of growing up

0:27:59.780,0:28:03.890
that way and I feel badly for him

0:28:01.309,0:28:07.070
sometimes because he's done such amazing

0:28:03.890,0:28:08.510
things for himself in America and he has

0:28:07.070,0:28:11.780
a very comfortable life but I don't know

0:28:08.510,0:28:14.660
that he ever can fully appreciate that

0:28:11.780,0:28:16.309
yeah but I think not that you're not

0:28:14.660,0:28:18.679
appreciative of what you have but when

0:28:16.309,0:28:21.620
you have a dad like I do who came from

0:28:18.679,0:28:23.330
nothing in other stands what it means to

0:28:21.620,0:28:25.429
like kind of place yourself up by the

0:28:23.330,0:28:30.070
bootstraps I think that's been a good

0:28:25.429,0:28:32.750
example for me in terms of not taking

0:28:30.070,0:28:35.059
comfort for granted necessarily after I

0:28:32.750,0:28:38.090
do but just knowing what he went through

0:28:35.059,0:28:41.650
it kind of is a motivating factor to not

0:28:38.090,0:28:41.650
be lazy

0:28:43.360,0:28:46.360
yeah

0:28:53.720,0:29:00.680
how do you think my political views have

0:28:56.730,0:29:07.640
affected my relationship with my family

0:29:00.680,0:29:10.530
well I I perceive you as somebody who

0:29:07.640,0:29:11.340
you agree with me on those things in

0:29:10.530,0:29:14.190
terms of life

0:29:11.340,0:29:16.890
ideologically you know you think there

0:29:14.190,0:29:19.440
should be probably more control over

0:29:16.890,0:29:21.360
your choice that's like the world I have

0:29:19.440,0:29:24.180
a lot of important issues but I think

0:29:21.360,0:29:25.860
that you are more disillusioned with

0:29:24.180,0:29:28.140
politics that I am like I'm more

0:29:25.860,0:29:29.640
inclined to get behind somebody like

0:29:28.140,0:29:31.250
Obama or that sort of thing we're in

0:29:29.640,0:29:34.020
it's going well they're all kind of

0:29:31.250,0:29:36.030
crappy what do you think that's an

0:29:34.020,0:29:37.440
accurate thing to say I mean I don't

0:29:36.030,0:29:39.630
know if I'd go that far to say they're

0:29:37.440,0:29:41.190
all kind of crappy but but then I think

0:29:39.630,0:29:42.660
you're I think you have it sometimes you

0:29:41.190,0:29:45.060
get frustrated with just how the system

0:29:42.660,0:29:47.880
is I get frustrated with media

0:29:45.060,0:29:51.030
portrayals generally of all politics

0:29:47.880,0:29:53.850
regardless of party like I get

0:29:51.030,0:29:56.940
frustrated with the fact that you know

0:29:53.850,0:30:00.780
Hillary Clinton wait and Jeb Bush sad

0:29:56.940,0:30:02.190
today are things that people well in

0:30:00.780,0:30:04.560
terms of your relationship with your

0:30:02.190,0:30:08.030
family I think because of the fact that

0:30:04.560,0:30:11.040
your mom is so like super right wing you

0:30:08.030,0:30:13.710
have had to make a conscious decision as

0:30:11.040,0:30:16.440
a SMI especially to just let a lot of

0:30:13.710,0:30:17.850
stuff kind of let a lot of stuff go

0:30:16.440,0:30:20.940
because it's not worth having the

0:30:17.850,0:30:23.310
argument or saying what are you talking

0:30:20.940,0:30:24.870
about that's not true when you know that

0:30:23.310,0:30:27.480
you not necessarily changed somebody's

0:30:24.870,0:30:30.000
viewpoint because I think I mean I don't

0:30:27.480,0:30:32.820
know is your dad is he registered as a

0:30:30.000,0:30:35.580
Republican I think actually like my dad

0:30:32.820,0:30:36.850
may be even more Republican than my mom

0:30:35.580,0:30:39.460
just not a cycle

0:30:36.850,0:30:41.710
last focus like my mom was willing to

0:30:39.460,0:30:45.279
engage and just all our screaming

0:30:41.710,0:30:48.549
matches as we both yeah well know about

0:30:45.279,0:30:52.690
her beliefs luckily this past year she's

0:30:48.549,0:30:55.149
told that a little bit down from some of

0:30:52.690,0:30:59.440
the viewpoints that she's had but if you

0:30:55.149,0:31:02.649
get dad talking he's pretty right-wing

0:30:59.440,0:31:06.730
in a lot of his viewpoints you know and

0:31:02.649,0:31:09.129
especially this way or this way and you

0:31:06.730,0:31:12.669
know on the moral side of things as well

0:31:09.129,0:31:15.450
but I think technically a might even a

0:31:12.669,0:31:18.399
registered Republican because when I was

0:31:15.450,0:31:20.950
able to register to vote my parents told

0:31:18.399,0:31:23.590
me that was all the only choice that I

0:31:20.950,0:31:26.350
had was to register you know as I didn't

0:31:23.590,0:31:29.860
know that you didn't have to I really

0:31:26.350,0:31:33.909
didn't like so I got to the place where

0:31:29.860,0:31:36.610
you go to vote to go vote for Obama and

0:31:33.909,0:31:38.500
I like in the product brother you were

0:31:36.610,0:31:43.629
in either and I didn't realize that you

0:31:38.500,0:31:45.970
couldn't vote for anyone in the front so

0:31:43.629,0:31:49.659
that was a little bit of a black down to

0:31:45.970,0:31:51.490
kind of like I feel like you whatever

0:31:49.659,0:31:53.769
opinions your parents have you've been

0:31:51.490,0:31:55.840
able to separate that from forming your

0:31:53.769,0:32:00.490
own opinions well luckily I mean I went

0:31:55.840,0:32:03.340
to after high school because going to a

0:32:00.490,0:32:05.500
Catholic High School you have so many

0:32:03.340,0:32:07.210
viewpoints pushed on to your entire life

0:32:05.500,0:32:09.009
you know if you go to a Catholic Mass

0:32:07.210,0:32:10.840
every single Wednesday and you would

0:32:09.009,0:32:12.879
amass on Sunday then you have people

0:32:10.840,0:32:14.919
telling you exactly what you need to do

0:32:12.879,0:32:15.710
then you have the bishop coming and

0:32:14.919,0:32:17.330
saying hey

0:32:15.710,0:32:20.059
came from an anti-gay marriage

0:32:17.330,0:32:21.470
commercial isn't that great like you

0:32:20.059,0:32:23.330
just grow up with these viewpoints

0:32:21.470,0:32:26.659
shoved in your face and so when I went

0:32:23.330,0:32:29.720
to college I had anthropology I had

0:32:26.659,0:32:33.799
gender studies I had I mean liberal arts

0:32:29.720,0:32:34.580
college yeah there were so many other

0:32:33.799,0:32:37.610
options

0:32:34.580,0:32:40.299
and so I guess I took the opposite route

0:32:37.610,0:32:43.309
and said I'm just going to do it exactly

0:32:40.299,0:32:46.880
against everything that I've been told

0:32:43.309,0:32:50.630
to do and try to just learn everything I

0:32:46.880,0:32:52.820
possibly can about what else exists not

0:32:50.630,0:32:55.010
follow everything I've been told to

0:32:52.820,0:32:56.779
learn and just go the opposite way

0:32:55.010,0:32:59.570
you think that has more to do with kind

0:32:56.779,0:33:01.039
of rebelling against the education that

0:32:59.570,0:33:02.720
you had whether climate that were more

0:33:01.039,0:33:06.770
about your parents or I think it has to

0:33:02.720,0:33:08.990
do with me wanting to hope that more

0:33:06.770,0:33:13.789
exists than what people are saying

0:33:08.990,0:33:17.299
because their viewpoints yeah it'd be so

0:33:13.789,0:33:20.090
sad for me if all that existed was what

0:33:17.299,0:33:22.399
people sat on base so if all that

0:33:20.090,0:33:27.710
existed was like nope any people are

0:33:22.399,0:33:29.299
back down and story like that right and

0:33:27.710,0:33:33.169
like that's all people learned growing

0:33:29.299,0:33:35.840
up so I think that was my goal of in

0:33:33.169,0:33:39.590
going to college was only take classes

0:33:35.840,0:33:40.830
that were like absolutely I took classes

0:33:39.590,0:33:42.480
and

0:33:40.830,0:33:44.370
I take classes and moods at my tech

0:33:42.480,0:33:46.140
classes like in every single other

0:33:44.370,0:33:48.149
religion that Catholicism just because I

0:33:46.140,0:33:52.730
did not want to learn anything that I

0:33:48.149,0:33:57.750
had learned before she was really mad

0:33:52.730,0:34:00.320
mad that you were learning that for me

0:33:57.750,0:34:04.710
to learn things that she didn't think

0:34:00.320,0:34:06.149
were useful in any way wasn't what she

0:34:04.710,0:34:07.590
thought they were useful as she didn't

0:34:06.149,0:34:10.889
want you taking class about Islam or

0:34:07.590,0:34:12.510
this or that but also that like when I

0:34:10.889,0:34:15.839
told them I was getting a degree in

0:34:12.510,0:34:19.169
gender studies that was like the world

0:34:15.839,0:34:21.929
was ending like how could I was spending

0:34:19.169,0:34:24.750
almost a quarter million dollars on a

0:34:21.929,0:34:27.659
college education where I would never in

0:34:24.750,0:34:29.580
a million years get a job or be thought

0:34:27.659,0:34:32.310
of as an intelligent person right like

0:34:29.580,0:34:34.950
I'm not a lawyer a doctor I'm not like

0:34:32.310,0:34:37.230
going to run the world because I can

0:34:34.950,0:34:41.669
only think about culture like oh god

0:34:37.230,0:34:43.320
yeah when you but when it comes up like

0:34:41.669,0:34:44.909
now now with your parents obviously but

0:34:43.320,0:34:46.560
someone says I go what you majored in

0:34:44.909,0:34:49.169
college I saw big laughter I got laughs

0:34:46.560,0:34:51.270
yeah so what do you feel like you have

0:34:49.169,0:34:54.149
to explain yourself yes no I remember

0:34:51.270,0:34:58.050
that but somebody today said oh that

0:34:54.149,0:35:01.260
makes my politics degree sound like I'm

0:34:58.050,0:35:06.599
a genius and I was like I'm at work oh

0:35:01.260,0:35:10.020
yeah thinking I had your dick but in

0:35:06.599,0:35:13.589
real life I was like I probably know a

0:35:10.020,0:35:15.480
lot more about culture race religion and

0:35:13.589,0:35:17.369
how to talk about them in a way that

0:35:15.480,0:35:20.099
doesn't piss people off but also isn't

0:35:17.369,0:35:23.510
to PC yeah so like you can really just

0:35:20.099,0:35:26.790
go somewhere else like it doesn't matter

0:35:23.510,0:35:29.430
yeah that's a little off topic but I

0:35:26.790,0:35:31.500
think that that way of being able to

0:35:29.430,0:35:34.580
shape how I talk about things too and

0:35:31.500,0:35:38.910
walk that really fine line between

0:35:34.580,0:35:40.560
pissing my mom off angry my dad and

0:35:38.910,0:35:42.810
still believing in what I want to

0:35:40.560,0:35:46.080
believe in has been a

0:35:42.810,0:35:47.700
Yeah right I think the biggest bail for

0:35:46.080,0:35:49.950
you or anybody who majors in gender

0:35:47.700,0:35:52.260
studies as a woman is for people to not

0:35:49.950,0:35:54.360
just assume you're someone like raving

0:35:52.260,0:35:55.530
feminist two things all men are equal

0:35:54.360,0:35:57.270
because I think that's not to see what

0:35:55.530,0:35:58.890
people think about gender studies well I

0:35:57.270,0:36:03.000
think that's what that questionnaire I

0:35:58.890,0:36:05.130
felt like you know I don't you know I

0:36:03.000,0:36:08.220
don't think that there's necessarily

0:36:05.130,0:36:10.680
like a set person and I think that I

0:36:08.220,0:36:13.560
walked into a lot of stereotypes when I

0:36:10.680,0:36:16.500
was in college to playing hockey being

0:36:13.560,0:36:18.300
Gender Studies major being for main you

0:36:16.500,0:36:20.490
know just being athletic in general you

0:36:18.300,0:36:26.970
know there's a lot of different

0:36:20.490,0:36:28.650
stereotypes about you like - so are you

0:36:26.970,0:36:34.530
concerned that I won't be able to

0:36:28.650,0:36:38.490
provide health care for the family my

0:36:34.530,0:36:43.260
job which is a good thing because I

0:36:38.490,0:36:46.020
didn't yeah yeah well luckily I work for

0:36:43.260,0:36:48.660
employee benefits company so the

0:36:46.020,0:36:51.660
benefits are actually a great so I don't

0:36:48.660,0:36:56.190
actually think in today's world that

0:36:51.660,0:37:00.330
really matters who's you know getting

0:36:56.190,0:37:02.790
the we talk about this it's like we kind

0:37:00.330,0:37:06.090
of make high five that if one year

0:37:02.790,0:37:07.890
you're making a ton of money then that's

0:37:06.090,0:37:09.930
awesome if the next year I'm making in

0:37:07.890,0:37:11.730
time I need that's awesome yeah if it's

0:37:09.930,0:37:14.790
because I have a full-time job we're

0:37:11.730,0:37:19.680
getting covered with healthcare that's

0:37:14.790,0:37:21.890
awesome so no I'm not worried good I'll

0:37:19.680,0:37:21.890
provide

0:37:26.470,0:37:37.010
how do you think that political system

0:37:29.000,0:37:42.140
has failed us you or me well I think

0:37:37.010,0:37:45.500
there's so little bipartisanship that

0:37:42.140,0:37:47.000
it's just I mean I was saying bias that

0:37:45.500,0:37:51.859
somebody who's an Obama supporter but

0:37:47.000,0:37:53.599
the amount that the Republican Senate

0:37:51.859,0:37:57.590
has blocked everything that he's trying

0:37:53.599,0:37:59.270
to do even at the expense of benefiting

0:37:57.590,0:38:02.450
the American people just to promote a

0:37:59.270,0:38:07.790
certain agenda it's really troubling to

0:38:02.450,0:38:09.849
me so you know I think I'm not

0:38:07.790,0:38:12.800
necessarily somebody who has any

0:38:09.849,0:38:14.359
delusions that one president is going to

0:38:12.800,0:38:16.160
make everything great one person is

0:38:14.359,0:38:18.470
gonna make everything horrible but I

0:38:16.160,0:38:20.060
think there's so much bickering at this

0:38:18.470,0:38:23.000
point that there's not really a lot

0:38:20.060,0:38:26.320
that's been accomplished I don't really

0:38:23.000,0:38:28.900
know how how that changes obviously I

0:38:26.320,0:38:31.400
don't know what do you think I

0:38:28.900,0:38:33.619
definitely have to agree with you as

0:38:31.400,0:38:35.960
Steven reading daily even with the

0:38:33.619,0:38:38.240
Supreme Court being at a floor floor

0:38:35.960,0:38:40.460
traveling without holding things up they

0:38:38.240,0:38:43.520
were I was reading that with them at

0:38:40.460,0:38:48.050
tides turning into that said that

0:38:43.520,0:38:50.839
nothing will pass technicality and well

0:38:48.050,0:38:55.430
every other moment suggests will be shot

0:38:50.839,0:38:57.920
down yeah ice that bipartisanship is

0:38:55.430,0:39:01.339
really what and here's me a lot like

0:38:57.920,0:39:03.500
that so there's a lot of awesome you

0:39:01.339,0:39:08.780
know people from me like Olympia Snowe

0:39:03.500,0:39:11.690
who you know left politics because of

0:39:08.780,0:39:16.220
bipartisanship like it was so angering

0:39:11.690,0:39:20.320
that she would she left and she was in I

0:39:16.220,0:39:23.859
think for 18 years and

0:39:20.320,0:39:26.680
and it's women like that but I think

0:39:23.859,0:39:31.750
politics needs and I think when people

0:39:26.680,0:39:34.390
get so mired with AI Republic and I need

0:39:31.750,0:39:36.340
to believe this and I'm a Democrat I

0:39:34.390,0:39:39.040
need to believe this and you can't see

0:39:36.340,0:39:41.859
anywhere in the mill thousand it's so

0:39:39.040,0:39:45.070
dangerous like and people aren't even

0:39:41.859,0:39:46.510
willing to say I call somewhere in the

0:39:45.070,0:39:49.660
middle because there's no candidate

0:39:46.510,0:39:51.250
that's all smart right yeah I think well

0:39:49.660,0:39:53.140
that's why I'm gonna do it on these two

0:39:51.250,0:39:54.820
and Leno or whatever we're they would

0:39:53.140,0:39:56.950
literally read people quotes from the

0:39:54.820,0:39:58.300
other candidates and attributed to you

0:39:56.950,0:40:00.190
know some of those like Obama versus

0:39:58.300,0:40:01.900
McCain they say like well Barack Obama

0:40:00.190,0:40:04.540
said blah blah blah even if it was

0:40:01.900,0:40:06.340
McCain club and the person would be like

0:40:04.540,0:40:07.810
oh no that's ridiculous even if they

0:40:06.340,0:40:10.359
said they were McCain supporter you know

0:40:07.810,0:40:12.100
anything like people they all they it's

0:40:10.359,0:40:15.010
a very black and white and I think that

0:40:12.100,0:40:16.960
I mean that's why I think you've so

0:40:15.010,0:40:18.460
similar quizzes up saying like just what

0:40:16.960,0:40:20.350
are the issue that you care about and

0:40:18.460,0:40:22.240
what do you believe and then we're going

0:40:20.350,0:40:23.910
to tell you who your most aligned with

0:40:22.240,0:40:26.170
politically and so that way you're not

0:40:23.910,0:40:27.460
just saying oh well I agree with that

0:40:26.170,0:40:29.619
because it's Hillary and I think that's

0:40:27.460,0:40:31.359
ridiculous because Ted Cruz even though

0:40:29.619,0:40:33.760
I probably would be saying hey Lenny why

0:40:31.359,0:40:36.670
do you think people are so ill-informed

0:40:33.760,0:40:39.190
or missing Park develop so much like why

0:40:36.670,0:40:41.500
you think those like hey what do you

0:40:39.190,0:40:44.290
think about this like those always do so

0:40:41.500,0:40:47.380
well on the streets that was a dumb

0:40:44.290,0:40:50.530
people yeah yeah like I was reading

0:40:47.380,0:40:53.380
today like people were saying oh I'm so

0:40:50.530,0:40:55.390
upset that my federal income tax is so

0:40:53.380,0:40:57.250
high with like forty four percent of

0:40:55.390,0:41:01.119
people don't you pay federal income tax

0:40:57.250,0:41:02.320
yeah like you're upset and fifty six

0:41:01.119,0:41:06.140
percent

0:41:02.320,0:41:08.390
that's you know well in a year and over

0:41:06.140,0:41:10.250
now of comments sections being the way

0:41:08.390,0:41:12.440
people communicate it's just a sound

0:41:10.250,0:41:14.300
ring also a lot outraged about something

0:41:12.440,0:41:16.400
people really don't know three people

0:41:14.300,0:41:17.240
like it and so all of a sudden gives you

0:41:16.400,0:41:20.480
this ego boost

0:41:17.240,0:41:22.880
three people support your idiotic claims

0:41:20.480,0:41:24.980
and so all of a sudden you're on your

0:41:22.880,0:41:27.560
massive soapbox with your political

0:41:24.980,0:41:31.010
beliefs so I just think it's dangerous

0:41:27.560,0:41:31.550
when people get out of it those tanks

0:41:31.010,0:41:34.190
and riots

0:41:31.550,0:41:37.480
yeah I think that I mean to your right

0:41:34.190,0:41:39.320
there there's no most interesting and I

0:41:37.480,0:41:41.060
don't know I guess is putting in more

0:41:39.320,0:41:42.920
people than on politicians themselves

0:41:41.060,0:41:44.780
but when people have that mindset of

0:41:42.920,0:41:48.020
like well this is a party online with so

0:41:44.780,0:41:51.109
everything they say is the gospel and no

0:41:48.020,0:41:54.080
logic from the other side will even

0:41:51.109,0:41:56.119
enter my brain I think that's that could

0:41:54.080,0:41:58.910
be kind of dangerous so sort of office

0:41:56.119,0:42:01.700
is on there but with I think a lot of

0:41:58.910,0:42:05.599
the theme of this election with Bernie

0:42:01.700,0:42:09.220
Sanders itself is great you know how

0:42:05.599,0:42:12.200
super PACs and a lot of money has been a

0:42:09.220,0:42:15.140
driving force like do you think that has

0:42:12.200,0:42:17.480
been well people have talked about what

0:42:15.140,0:42:20.690
if they disallowed that from happening

0:42:17.480,0:42:22.339
what if they said you cannot take that

0:42:20.690,0:42:23.900
kind of money everything has to be

0:42:22.339,0:42:25.609
funded based on like you all have

0:42:23.900,0:42:27.170
essentially the same allotment for your

0:42:25.609,0:42:29.450
campaign it's the same way that you know

0:42:27.170,0:42:32.060
when you lost an Oh Jay show it wasn't

0:42:29.450,0:42:34.160
the problem was that the legal system is

0:42:32.060,0:42:35.060
unfair when one person can have a lawyer

0:42:34.160,0:42:36.710
that there

0:42:35.060,0:42:39.770
the other person has a public defender

0:42:36.710,0:42:42.530
it's not going to be fair so of course

0:42:39.770,0:42:44.900
in politics that give somebody who has a

0:42:42.530,0:42:47.270
ton of support financially from super

0:42:44.900,0:42:49.040
PACs and from all these supporters right

0:42:47.270,0:42:49.760
you're it's going to be very hard to

0:42:49.040,0:42:51.950
compete with that

0:42:49.760,0:42:53.720
for examines trying to use that to his

0:42:51.950,0:42:55.220
advantage saying like look I'm not like

0:42:53.720,0:42:57.920
everybody else in taking all these

0:42:55.220,0:42:59.960
handouts I'm raising money getting small

0:42:57.920,0:43:01.580
donations on but yeah I think it would I

0:42:59.960,0:43:03.140
think it would probably be better and

0:43:01.580,0:43:05.420
obviously even people who get a lot of

0:43:03.140,0:43:07.790
money I think it would be a lot less

0:43:05.420,0:43:09.110
stressful for them also so they could

0:43:07.790,0:43:11.390
focus on the things that you care about

0:43:09.110,0:43:13.870
rather than trying to curry favor from a

0:43:11.390,0:43:18.170
bunch of people who have deep pockets

0:43:13.870,0:43:25.280
that's one of what scares you the most

0:43:18.170,0:43:28.010
these days I think the fact we talk

0:43:25.280,0:43:30.680
about this but what scares me the most

0:43:28.010,0:43:37.150
is the direction of this country is

0:43:30.680,0:43:39.380
heading in without a true and clear

0:43:37.150,0:43:41.660
definition of where the leadership is

0:43:39.380,0:43:43.730
going you know and people are saying

0:43:41.660,0:43:48.410
yeah it's going to be Hillary and Trump

0:43:43.730,0:43:52.040
at the end and that's you know find her

0:43:48.410,0:43:54.110
the people who believe in both but

0:43:52.040,0:43:58.130
that's still a little scary for me and I

0:43:54.110,0:44:00.350
think that having an unclear path and

0:43:58.130,0:44:01.940
such a bipartisan druing and also it's

0:44:00.350,0:44:03.770
really scary that Trump has made it this

0:44:01.940,0:44:07.940
far that's what really scares me it

0:44:03.770,0:44:11.320
scares me that so many people in this

0:44:07.940,0:44:13.370
nation can believe in a guy like that

0:44:11.320,0:44:14.660
but at least we live in a place where

0:44:13.370,0:44:16.030
there is the checks and balances you

0:44:14.660,0:44:19.370
know anything he's not going to be

0:44:16.030,0:44:20.770
Korean from yeah but I guess the thing

0:44:19.370,0:44:24.720
about it that I cover in violence

0:44:20.770,0:44:27.490
is was my life significantly different

0:44:24.720,0:44:30.610
when george w bush was president versus

0:44:27.490,0:44:32.320
when Obama was president but I think it

0:44:30.610,0:44:35.830
would be different if Travis Rosen

0:44:32.320,0:44:38.170
probably because I I think that we can

0:44:35.830,0:44:40.990
look back in 50 years

0:44:38.170,0:44:42.910
don't forget cruising he's almost I'm

0:44:40.990,0:44:45.580
gonna try to reverse a lot of things but

0:44:42.910,0:44:47.350
I think that we'll look back in 50 or

0:44:45.580,0:44:49.710
100 years people could agree with this

0:44:47.350,0:44:52.630
or not disagree with this turnout but

0:44:49.710,0:44:55.330
fifty or hundred years Bush and Obama I

0:44:52.630,0:45:00.250
think will be looked up in history books

0:44:55.330,0:45:02.110
as you know good press hence yeah but I

0:45:00.250,0:45:04.170
think that if Trump was president it

0:45:02.110,0:45:06.940
would be a disaster yeah it would be a

0:45:04.170,0:45:09.010
worldwide disaster it's just kind of

0:45:06.940,0:45:11.110
like a mockery and that's so scary

0:45:09.010,0:45:16.080
yeah because when you when you hear

0:45:11.110,0:45:19.360
about plans or attempts at plans like

0:45:16.080,0:45:20.830
destroying the Middle East building wall

0:45:19.360,0:45:24.300
but that is scary

0:45:20.830,0:45:28.560
how do you bring a child into the world

0:45:24.300,0:45:32.610
with things like that being said with

0:45:28.560,0:45:36.130
the quote where he said if I don't win

0:45:32.610,0:45:39.940
I'm not threatening violence but it may

0:45:36.130,0:45:42.310
happen like notice yeah he's a time

0:45:39.940,0:45:45.310
Cleveland like right that's a real thing

0:45:42.310,0:45:47.320
that you say and he's like taunting

0:45:45.310,0:45:48.760
these white people to say like let's go

0:45:47.320,0:45:50.920
be violent against people that don't

0:45:48.760,0:45:53.560
vote for us that's insane that's a very

0:45:50.920,0:45:55.870
dangerous world that we are living like

0:45:53.560,0:45:58.900
that's not I mean I think but again I

0:45:55.870,0:46:02.110
think whoever whoever's in charge think

0:45:58.900,0:46:04.690
that's scary now it's just the capacity

0:46:02.110,0:46:06.940
for like random acts of mass violence

0:46:04.690,0:46:08.500
until that will be terrorism it can be

0:46:06.940,0:46:12.670
like in terms of

0:46:08.500,0:46:15.460
but the fact that you can have seemingly

0:46:12.670,0:46:17.230
a safe plan for your day where I'm going

0:46:15.460,0:46:19.840
to get up and take a shower or go to the

0:46:17.230,0:46:22.030
movies and you could get shot there like

0:46:19.840,0:46:23.380
that's not how it always was so that but

0:46:22.030,0:46:26.800
I also think that on the other side that

0:46:23.380,0:46:28.990
you can't just live your life and that's

0:46:26.800,0:46:30.220
what we always try setting them on like

0:46:28.990,0:46:33.100
what I'm gonna talk about living in New

0:46:30.220,0:46:34.450
York you can't live your life not riding

0:46:33.100,0:46:36.850
the drink and you can't live your life

0:46:34.450,0:46:39.190
not going to work you can't live your

0:46:36.850,0:46:41.200
life afraid of absolutely everything

0:46:39.190,0:46:42.550
because anything could happen

0:46:41.200,0:46:52.300
how do you function they're just yeah

0:46:42.550,0:46:54.370
you'd be crippled is their life so what

0:46:52.300,0:47:07.750
issues do you wish I cared about more

0:46:54.370,0:47:09.370
and why I think you do really that's

0:47:07.750,0:47:26.550
like a Syria you lack the like you

0:47:09.370,0:47:29.260
really do well that's not yeah okay I

0:47:26.550,0:47:31.210
think I feel like there are times where

0:47:29.260,0:47:33.220
I wish I cared about stuff more in terms

0:47:31.210,0:47:34.750
of actually like it's easy to talk about

0:47:33.220,0:47:36.070
like oh I feel this very feel that way

0:47:34.750,0:47:38.170
but I don't know that either was really

0:47:36.070,0:47:39.370
do a lot about it other than having a

0:47:38.170,0:47:41.950
conversation about it

0:47:39.370,0:47:45.340
but I also don't know that I want to

0:47:41.950,0:47:46.180
make that effort I feel like well there

0:47:45.340,0:47:47.500
are some things

0:47:46.180,0:47:51.610
I feel like I just get enraged about

0:47:47.500,0:47:53.110
yeah and I feel like you haven't like

0:47:51.610,0:47:54.730
studied up because like I do a lot of

0:47:53.110,0:47:57.820
reading during the week on the subway

0:47:54.730,0:47:59.200
and I'll just get really angry about at

0:47:57.820,0:48:00.970
the time but then when I realized that

0:47:59.200,0:48:02.650
you don't or haven't read about them

0:48:00.970,0:48:05.230
either I'll just like forget about them

0:48:02.650,0:48:06.550
or drop them like what sort like a lot

0:48:05.230,0:48:09.730
of the things are just things going on

0:48:06.550,0:48:14.290
in the world or my celebrity gossip that

0:48:09.730,0:48:16.390
I love dearly like I don't know I can't

0:48:14.290,0:48:21.460
think about anything specifically but

0:48:16.390,0:48:34.920
usually why I bring things out hold on a

0:48:21.460,0:48:38.160
sec we're getting down to the end here

0:48:34.920,0:48:38.160
how you doing

0:48:41.400,0:48:45.240
Carmela yeah

0:48:49.510,0:48:55.630
we're you guys filming stuff out there

0:48:51.500,0:48:55.630
for this - or different job

0:49:11.920,0:49:15.130
she helped

0:49:18.860,0:49:23.090
help ya

0:49:28.740,0:49:35.720
I can promote this car if it's Darius

0:50:19.900,0:50:23.630
how do you think that what parents

0:50:22.220,0:50:30.349
vehicle Jews have affected our

0:50:23.630,0:50:36.980
relationship of what would you change I

0:50:30.349,0:50:38.390
think probably my parents have so I know

0:50:36.980,0:50:42.799
that you get frustrated with the way

0:50:38.390,0:50:48.500
that my parents are such that comes

0:50:42.799,0:50:50.960
across with her political views I don't

0:50:48.500,0:51:09.470
think it's truly like beginning it may

0:50:50.960,0:51:11.170
have in some ways affected I don't know

0:51:09.470,0:51:15.829
if I would change it this is my mom's

0:51:11.170,0:51:18.380
works yeah it hasn't because of the fact

0:51:15.829,0:51:20.510
that they believe even all but all for

0:51:18.380,0:51:21.230
been in the same room months oh right

0:51:20.510,0:51:23.690
yeah

0:51:21.230,0:51:26.390
that wasn't bad well it was fine but I

0:51:23.690,0:51:29.029
mean the thing is if they lived in the

0:51:26.390,0:51:30.700
same town and we had the opportunity for

0:51:29.029,0:51:32.359
them to get together every two weeks I

0:51:30.700,0:51:35.480
don't know that that would necessarily

0:51:32.359,0:51:37.220
be a great thing but I think that in the

0:51:35.480,0:51:41.329
capacity that it is now which is they

0:51:37.220,0:51:44.240
communicate through us largely and see

0:51:41.329,0:51:45.740
each other for you know our wedding and

0:51:44.240,0:51:50.529
important events and that sort of thing

0:51:45.740,0:51:50.529
I think everyone will be cool

0:51:54.150,0:52:04.150
who sacrifices more in our relationship

0:51:57.460,0:52:06.610
and why I mean I think just objectively

0:52:04.150,0:52:10.270
you've made more sacrifices than I have

0:52:06.610,0:52:12.460
a necessity in that when we've been

0:52:10.270,0:52:16.570
together you know for a year and a half

0:52:12.460,0:52:18.790
long distance and I was here just by the

0:52:16.570,0:52:20.650
nature of the situation I didn't have

0:52:18.790,0:52:22.000
the flexibility to say all right well

0:52:20.650,0:52:26.590
I'm going to come to you although to me

0:52:22.000,0:52:28.990
so you know I think that is the

0:52:26.590,0:52:30.340
number-one thing the fact that you were

0:52:28.990,0:52:33.310
willing to leave replaced you live

0:52:30.340,0:52:36.280
literally your entire life to being an

0:52:33.310,0:52:40.240
absolutely new environment I don't think

0:52:36.280,0:52:44.130
I can really equal that in any way but I

0:52:40.240,0:52:47.850
think that I try to do a good job of I

0:52:44.130,0:52:49.960
guess maybe smaller things or at least

0:52:47.850,0:52:52.240
listening to you or listening to your

0:52:49.960,0:52:53.350
point of view on stuff when there's

0:52:52.240,0:52:56.170
something that's more important to you

0:52:53.350,0:53:01.200
or something that would help Plagueis

0:52:56.170,0:53:01.200
alleviate some of the loneliness or what

0:53:01.680,0:53:07.570
but no I mean when wouldn't the

0:53:04.540,0:53:09.330
situation presented itself to move to

0:53:07.570,0:53:11.230
where we are on Bay Ridge now and

0:53:09.330,0:53:12.910
initially when you brought it up I was

0:53:11.230,0:53:14.980
very I don't say dismiss it but I was

0:53:12.910,0:53:16.570
very insistent that I wanted to stay in

0:53:14.980,0:53:18.910
Astoria because I liked it and I was

0:53:16.570,0:53:21.070
comfortable there and I knew people you

0:53:18.910,0:53:24.280
know I was friends with come to their

0:53:21.070,0:53:27.310
level but but I think that when I took a

0:53:24.280,0:53:30.190
step back and realized what you were

0:53:27.310,0:53:33.820
asking of me versus what I had asked of

0:53:30.190,0:53:35.770
you it wasn't even close so for me to

0:53:33.820,0:53:38.470
say like no you have to live in the city

0:53:35.770,0:53:39.240
but also the one part of the one borough

0:53:38.470,0:53:41.760
that I

0:53:39.240,0:53:43.680
it would have been really unreasonable

0:53:41.760,0:53:46.080
and so when things like that come up or

0:53:43.680,0:53:47.940
even I mean we joke about the idea of

0:53:46.080,0:53:50.010
getting a dog or something I've got the

0:53:47.940,0:53:53.970
guy I understand that the reality of the

0:53:50.010,0:53:55.710
situation is that I don't necessarily

0:53:53.970,0:53:58.140
have a ton of friends that I see often

0:53:55.710,0:54:00.390
but all of my family and friends are

0:53:58.140,0:54:02.760
much closer to me than yours are to you

0:54:00.390,0:54:05.640
and I know that that's really hard and

0:54:02.760,0:54:08.099
so even though I never imagined getting

0:54:05.640,0:54:10.050
a dog how you when something like that

0:54:08.099,0:54:11.400
comes up I don't just think of it that's

0:54:10.050,0:54:12.240
black and white like do I want a dog

0:54:11.400,0:54:15.060
doing that one

0:54:12.240,0:54:18.270
it's what would it mean to you and would

0:54:15.060,0:54:20.190
it be something that would like improve

0:54:18.270,0:54:22.230
your quality of life quite obviously and

0:54:20.190,0:54:26.280
happiness because of the fact that I've

0:54:22.230,0:54:28.560
had to ask a lot of people I think it is

0:54:26.280,0:54:31.770
like an even sacrificing obviously on

0:54:28.560,0:54:34.740
that at the beginning moving down here

0:54:31.770,0:54:37.980
was similarly a lot and I need you a lot

0:54:34.740,0:54:40.020
of my friends and especially like my

0:54:37.980,0:54:43.200
family probably even still to this day

0:54:40.020,0:54:45.119
some of my pen looks like why you why

0:54:43.200,0:54:47.070
did you move to New York I stood and

0:54:45.119,0:54:48.390
kept that with you and know that I love

0:54:47.070,0:54:50.160
you and that we're getting married to

0:54:48.390,0:54:50.820
get all the bad stuff from like moving

0:54:50.160,0:54:54.630
to New York

0:54:50.820,0:54:58.230
when clearly I'm so in love with the

0:54:54.630,0:54:59.760
idea of Maine seems like there's crazy

0:54:58.230,0:55:00.960
idea like oh yeah you wouldn't you

0:54:59.760,0:55:02.010
wouldn't have moved I mean they're

0:55:00.960,0:55:03.390
planning actually there's plenty people

0:55:02.010,0:55:04.800
who live in Maine and always want to

0:55:03.390,0:55:06.750
live the city of theirs so they went to

0:55:04.800,0:55:10.609
Boston to New York whatever but they're

0:55:06.750,0:55:13.190
like that's not it's right but that's

0:55:10.609,0:55:14.180
you envision for yourself yeah anything

0:55:13.190,0:55:15.440
happen that we say would have been

0:55:14.180,0:55:19.309
easier definitely I was gonna go there

0:55:15.440,0:55:21.650
anyways so go deal with this guy but I

0:55:19.309,0:55:24.980
don't think that I don't think you want

0:55:21.650,0:55:28.069
to pay that sacrifice if what we had was

0:55:24.980,0:55:31.190
wasn't worth because that's a huge thing

0:55:28.069,0:55:33.109
to do yeah and I think that at the

0:55:31.190,0:55:36.410
beginning way of beginning we both

0:55:33.109,0:55:38.359
sacrificed a lot like all those trips

0:55:36.410,0:55:43.400
driving to each other in what was ours

0:55:38.359,0:55:46.039
are mega buses mega bus yeah I mean

0:55:43.400,0:55:49.009
that's the certainly for the first year

0:55:46.039,0:55:53.180
and a half it was a lot of sacrifice

0:55:49.009,0:55:55.460
both ways in terms of just literally the

0:55:53.180,0:55:57.739
logistics of it you know to make it work

0:55:55.460,0:56:00.440
to see each other at least once a month

0:55:57.739,0:56:02.359
which is what we tried to do that meant

0:56:00.440,0:56:04.730
that you or I we're going to have to

0:56:02.359,0:56:07.579
drive or take a series of buses eight

0:56:04.730,0:56:09.710
hours to see each other and I think that

0:56:07.579,0:56:12.799
from the beginning was the reflection of

0:56:09.710,0:56:15.079
the fact that what we had going out was

0:56:12.799,0:56:17.029
worth all that effort because we would

0:56:15.079,0:56:19.519
have been insane to go through that if

0:56:17.029,0:56:22.390
it was just for something like casual

0:56:19.519,0:56:22.390
sort of thing

0:56:25.430,0:56:29.720
if you have a daughter what do you hope

0:56:27.650,0:56:32.350
will be different for her in the future

0:56:29.720,0:56:32.350
as a woman

0:56:38.020,0:56:47.260
I hope that if I have a daughter that

0:56:44.490,0:56:49.540
chelonian have to think about the fact

0:56:47.260,0:56:52.050
that she would be different from son if

0:56:49.540,0:56:54.310
that makes sense yeah

0:56:52.050,0:56:55.630
she wouldn't even have to think about

0:56:54.310,0:56:58.140
the fact that being a Gender Studies

0:56:55.630,0:57:01.900
major would be different than being a

0:56:58.140,0:57:04.450
pre-law student that she would have to

0:57:01.900,0:57:06.790
think about meeting 75 cents on the

0:57:04.450,0:57:08.710
dollar to like stupid things like that

0:57:06.790,0:57:11.620
that people bring up every time they

0:57:08.710,0:57:14.740
think about gender disability that's a

0:57:11.620,0:57:16.690
big it's a big deal and I really hope

0:57:14.740,0:57:18.220
that that type of thing is something

0:57:16.690,0:57:21.190
that she never even has to think about

0:57:18.220,0:57:23.890
yeah like she could just grow up and do

0:57:21.190,0:57:26.700
whatever the hell she wants and not have

0:57:23.890,0:57:30.610
to think about who she wants to do it

0:57:26.700,0:57:33.400
what patterns you wants to use what

0:57:30.610,0:57:37.000
religion she wants to be if she wants to

0:57:33.400,0:57:40.030
you know go to college or not go to

0:57:37.000,0:57:43.240
college whatever like I think that's

0:57:40.030,0:57:47.020
like my biggest goal it's just to allow

0:57:43.240,0:57:51.760
my daughter's son whatever genders child

0:57:47.020,0:57:54.280
I have just allowing them to really be

0:57:51.760,0:57:56.470
whoever they wanted me because I think

0:57:54.280,0:57:59.170
that if you don't and I think a little

0:57:56.470,0:58:02.260
bit of this was on me and I luckily grew

0:57:59.170,0:58:06.100
the other way but I see and I I saw a

0:58:02.260,0:58:08.880
lot of kids that grew into a very

0:58:06.100,0:58:12.640
horrible like militaristic and

0:58:08.880,0:58:14.380
uneducated version of a person because

0:58:12.640,0:58:16.920
they were told what they were supposed

0:58:14.380,0:58:19.780
to be I think that that isn't healthy

0:58:16.920,0:58:22.480
and so I'm just hoping to not tell

0:58:19.780,0:58:26.790
anyone what to do other than keep them

0:58:22.480,0:58:26.790
safe yeah yeah

0:58:30.660,0:58:38.350
what you hope I've learned from you

0:58:33.190,0:58:39.580
today both of us well I mean again I

0:58:38.350,0:58:41.530
think we have a pretty transparent

0:58:39.580,0:58:44.020
relationship and so I don't know that I

0:58:41.530,0:58:46.660
necessarily came into tonight thinking

0:58:44.020,0:58:48.670
that I was gonna have some sort of you

0:58:46.660,0:58:51.210
know bombshell discovery about something

0:58:48.670,0:58:54.070
that you and I had done

0:58:51.210,0:58:55.920
but I hope that it's apparent to you

0:58:54.070,0:58:59.380
that these are things that I think about

0:58:55.920,0:59:03.190
even if I don't localize that verbalize

0:58:59.380,0:59:06.940
that you know that if you ever feel like

0:59:03.190,0:59:08.890
I'm not conscious of the sacrifices that

0:59:06.940,0:59:11.170
you've made or I'm not aware of the

0:59:08.890,0:59:12.850
things that are important to you or the

0:59:11.170,0:59:14.410
things that you hope for us in the

0:59:12.850,0:59:16.630
future that that's something that I'm

0:59:14.410,0:59:18.730
kind of always thinking about even if

0:59:16.630,0:59:21.220
I'm not specifically talking about it or

0:59:18.730,0:59:23.170
thinking about it that whole which I

0:59:21.220,0:59:24.970
hope that you know that but you know

0:59:23.170,0:59:26.440
it's not something that we always say

0:59:24.970,0:59:28.030
like all right well for the next 15

0:59:26.440,0:59:31.119
minutes let's talk about our future it's

0:59:28.030,0:59:33.400
just stuff that we've kind of brought up

0:59:31.119,0:59:37.090
at various times and then three plus

0:59:33.400,0:59:40.840
years we've been together I didn't know

0:59:37.090,0:59:42.880
I could stare at you for this long now I

0:59:40.840,0:59:45.760
feel like we don't really talk that much

0:59:42.880,0:59:47.880
about political things like I think when

0:59:45.760,0:59:50.890
we finally get to spend time together

0:59:47.880,0:59:53.980
because it seems not like Rare but like

0:59:50.890,0:59:56.920
kind of opportunity sort of just spend

0:59:53.980,0:59:58.270
that time together catch up on the

0:59:56.920,1:00:01.560
things that happen in the day and don't

0:59:58.270,1:00:04.690
really want to get weighed down by

1:00:01.560,1:00:06.460
political things or like when I because

1:00:04.690,1:00:10.050
I kind of get worked up because I just

1:00:06.460,1:00:10.050
don't like when people

1:00:11.229,1:00:16.579
and so I guess it was nice getting to

1:00:14.539,1:00:18.619
hear you you know talk a little bit

1:00:16.579,1:00:22.279
about some of your opinions about

1:00:18.619,1:00:25.579
side-eye I think I started realized that

1:00:22.279,1:00:28.329
we do agree on them nothing in the class

1:00:25.579,1:00:32.089
we agree but I think we actually agree a

1:00:28.329,1:00:35.869
lot more than I thought that yeah I mean

1:00:32.089,1:00:37.759
I kind of wonder how people have strong

1:00:35.869,1:00:40.789
relationships when they don't agree on

1:00:37.759,1:00:43.009
like fundamental things you know I was

1:00:40.789,1:00:45.859
worried going into this that we were and

1:00:43.009,1:00:47.119
I like disagree on political things like

1:00:45.859,1:00:48.979
I was the ring there are some things

1:00:47.119,1:00:53.359
that we that we do disagree on that I

1:00:48.979,1:00:55.519
think if you mean that we were just whoa

1:00:53.359,1:00:58.700
that's like a huge bombshell I'm like

1:00:55.519,1:01:00.469
didn't know you loved Trump today like

1:00:58.700,1:01:01.609
that would have been like a big thing I

1:01:00.469,1:01:04.339
would have learned but you know I think

1:01:01.609,1:01:08.140
that a lot of this stuff that we on the

1:01:04.339,1:01:10.579
basilar related group all right

1:01:08.140,1:01:15.229
do you think I'd make a good president

1:01:10.579,1:01:20.450
or political leader here Obama

1:01:15.229,1:01:26.269
impression on us I don't know honey

1:01:20.450,1:01:29.150
honestly I'm sorry listen uh yeah I

1:01:26.269,1:01:33.499
think that you like pleasing a lot of

1:01:29.150,1:01:35.180
people and that's a good thing but you

1:01:33.499,1:01:36.559
also don't like letting people down and

1:01:35.180,1:01:39.710
I think that to be a leader

1:01:36.559,1:01:45.940
unfortunately I have to let at least 50%

1:01:39.710,1:01:45.940
or 49% of people check so you may well

1:01:46.410,1:01:51.960
your dream job that way no I literally

1:01:49.920,1:01:53.549
agree I think I mean up still a kind of

1:01:51.960,1:01:54.599
playful Arabic I find that that one

1:01:53.549,1:01:56.579
person doesn't like me I'm very

1:01:54.599,1:01:58.500
flustered I know and so we still know

1:01:56.579,1:02:00.799
exactly who that person was it didn't

1:01:58.500,1:02:03.660
like that one show three years ago I

1:02:00.799,1:02:06.480
don't know yeah I don't think I have the

1:02:03.660,1:02:11.099
stomach for any that stuff I think that

1:02:06.480,1:02:14.400
I'm also a very I try to be a very moral

1:02:11.099,1:02:16.170
person in the sense that if I've done

1:02:14.400,1:02:20.869
something that I feel like is wrong or

1:02:16.170,1:02:20.869
slated somebody I it really bothers me

1:02:22.819,1:02:38.910
yeah why do you love me so many reasons

1:02:34.890,1:02:43.140
I love you because everything has always

1:02:38.910,1:02:45.930
been really really easy it's been

1:02:43.140,1:02:47.819
everything about us is what people say

1:02:45.930,1:02:51.029
doesn't exist when people talk about

1:02:47.819,1:02:53.880
what an ideal relationship is it doesn't

1:02:51.029,1:02:55.500
mean that you have created 100% all the

1:02:53.880,1:02:58.920
time on every single thing you talk

1:02:55.500,1:03:02.819
about but it's having that perfect

1:02:58.920,1:03:05.549
perfect mixture of friendship with

1:03:02.819,1:03:07.920
attraction with respect for somebody and

1:03:05.549,1:03:10.559
I think that's in our entire

1:03:07.920,1:03:11.589
relationship as angers have been each

1:03:10.559,1:03:14.880
other and

1:03:11.589,1:03:17.109
time about big things whether it was you

1:03:14.880,1:03:18.519
being willing to move here or whether or

1:03:17.109,1:03:21.039
not think you're gonna work out there

1:03:18.519,1:03:23.019
was never a time that we cursed at each

1:03:21.039,1:03:26.950
other or said things that we can take

1:03:23.019,1:03:30.069
back and I think that that has laid the

1:03:26.950,1:03:30.489
groundwork for a really awesome life

1:03:30.069,1:03:35.200
together

1:03:30.489,1:03:37.299
and I think that it's just a level of

1:03:35.200,1:03:38.950
comfort than I have with you that I

1:03:37.299,1:03:41.979
haven't had with anybody else and that's

1:03:38.950,1:03:43.960
why even when we think about the future

1:03:41.979,1:03:45.880
none of that scares me because I know

1:03:43.960,1:03:49.319
that as long as you and I are doing all

1:03:45.880,1:03:49.319
that stuff together it's gonna be fine

1:03:53.400,1:04:00.069
yeah Cheers have any question any other

1:03:58.420,1:04:09.880
questions I popped up for that you want

1:04:00.069,1:04:13.660
to ask each other you're worried that I

1:04:09.880,1:04:19.019
cannot respond to that answer for all

1:04:13.660,1:04:19.019
the same reasons at one plus one
