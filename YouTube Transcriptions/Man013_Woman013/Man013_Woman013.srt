1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:37,290
what's your favorite childhood memory

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:39,620
and why anything you took part in a swim

3
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,620
team

4
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:59,870
what do you think my favorite childhood

5
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,870
memory is what about visiting China

6
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:21,690
like just playing outside I'm not good

7
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,300
at remembering my childhood I learned to

8
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,960
ride a bicycle yeah that was good I

9
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,410
remember how you took my training wheels

10
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:39,780
off right well the first thing to teach

11
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:44,670
you is that you know I can still ride a

12
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,930
bike what's the most fun you've had with

13
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:52,590
me and why okay I think I should need to

14
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,380
think about watching jeopardy or try to

15
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,930
prove that we are the smartest import in

16
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,479
the world let's share I look for it

17
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:08,300
actually yes it's more corrector than

18
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:08,300
I've learned from the best

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,080
what's the most ridiculous thing I have

20
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,489
done what did it teach you about me I

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:29,459
don't think I've ever done anything

22
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:33,300
ridiculous okay sure I think tricky

23
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,250
waters I think right now something

24
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:45,030
ridiculous you're doing is digging our

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:48,890
basement another person told you I need

26
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,890
to take out the trash to avoid

27
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:09,500
tell me what you remember from the first

28
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:12,110
time we met and how it felt horrible so

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:18,550
who do you were born to this world yeah

30
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:26,330
how did that work it was one of the most

31
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:29,770
proudest moments I would probably look

32
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,200
at disgusting and covered in crab right

33
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,720
as I remember your first smart then you

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,110
start to cry before you cry you first

35
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,850
why that's an emotional rollercoaster

36
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:52,600
birth is exciting and then right now I

37
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:52,600
think what are you hesitant to tell me

38
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:08,720
something wrong I think maybe talking

39
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,850
about my emotions but I'm pretty

40
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,640
hesitant to talk about my emotions with

41
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:21,040
anybody you tried to conceal something

42
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,040
right no not really

43
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:28,190
what are the three funniest but that's

44
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:36,130
crossed out now it says best memories

45
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:40,130
that we shared when we went to China

46
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:46,600
together twice yeah the second time so

47
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:49,310
that counting is two of the three I

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,010
introduced many Chinese attractions to

49
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:56,480
you yeah including that wax museum that

50
00:04:52,010 --> 00:05:00,580
you hated okay Dee Sangha you only had

51
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,580
to do we need to say sorry

52
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:11,530
they're filming us we have to you have

53
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:15,729
to get all three of us good thing to do

54
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:18,340
Oh again this time we do it toward

55
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,300
France for the first time it's true it

56
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,360
was very good

57
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,360
it seems like many of them are together

58
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:44,669
now if you would wish one thing for me

59
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:44,669
what would it to be one thing for me to

60
00:05:51,990 --> 00:06:44,319
do going back to me emotions question

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,759
clearly when was the time you're proud

62
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,069
of me and why and obviously I know when

63
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,159
you work in the White House that made me

64
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:57,069
so happy at the top of this world

65
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,840
yeah and for that we were even able to

66
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:02,909
visit the Oval Office

67
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,909
everybody will have this chance

68
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,559
what's that my time yeah okay

69
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:26,349
what do you think my best qualities is a

70
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:30,659
father there's enough digital tape to

71
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:35,309
roll this could go for hours you're

72
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:37,929
extremely integral and intelligent and

73
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:40,539
have such a strong work ethic that I

74
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:42,339
think is really inspirational yeah

75
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:45,579
there's like a million things you're

76
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:56,229
funny you pursue things that you believe

77
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:57,999
in you're honest what have I done or

78
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,839
what happened to me that scared you the

79
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,839
most and why

80
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:07,049

81
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,209

90
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:47,280
think it'll be something more than this

actually Thanks no it's my turn

92
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:58,720

this is perfect what do you think is

94
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:12,040
special about already I think you're

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:16,870
right yeah right so what do you think is

96
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,490
special about our relationship I don't

97
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,380
know I think we have a lot of common

98
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,740
interests which sometimes is unusual

99
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,260
between parent and child so that's

100
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:38,770
special what do you think is special

101
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:42,010
mm-hmm no animosity true and also pipe

102
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,870
something as you understand even every

103
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:52,060
day night we cook Mew together we

104
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:56,680
cooperate so we're cooking dream team

105
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,930
everyone is invited to partake if you

106
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,710
could go back in time what would you

107
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,290
change

108
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,240
I don't know if this question means like

109
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:10,000
everything like you could kill Hitler or

110
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,650
that pertains to our life that's certain

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,810
you would have regret all the time

112
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,820
something would think if I do it again I

113
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:25,390
would do different yeah yeah is there

114
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:27,970
like a specific thing specific progress

115
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:36,640
or not sometimes should not push people

116
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:41,800
so hard a little bit patient just a

117
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:49,030
little bit when I try occasion road-rage

118
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:51,330
less what's the greatest lesson I taught

119
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,330
you

120
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:00,649
I think being an integral person who

121
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,470
works really hard for not really for

122
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,589
other people but for yourself and for

123
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,089
other people obviously you do it for us

124
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:12,260
putting yeah I don't know a lot of

125
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:15,140
things and be persistent yeah no Brooke

126
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,899
what's the word Prague Prague now what's

127
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,600
always daily always progressive

128
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,329
progressive which is of course how do

129
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,040
you feel about my procrastination

130
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:32,390
progress dick right procrastination

131
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:36,200
procrastination okay what's one lesson

132
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:39,440
or idea you want me to never forget said

133
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:51,589
again what one lesson our idea you you

134
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:57,250
want me to never forget I would say just

135
00:11:51,589 --> 00:12:01,510
try to pursue your own dream or go

136
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:05,690
processing today never be afraid of any

137
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:07,899
difficulties even if my dream is to be a

138
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,899
waitress

139
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:30,250
okay so there's an asterisk what's a

140
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:33,740
question you always wanted to ask me I

141
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:37,540
think I always want to ask you about

142
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:40,300
your like your childhood in your history

143
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,560
like always curious to know more

144
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,990
especially cultural revolution like

145
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,750
where things happen during your time

146
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,200
even to today I could not believe that

147
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,360
happened to me

148
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,430
yeah I want to hear I feel like me and

149
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,139
how en don't know like even close to

150
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,029
some of this stuff the schools were

151
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,410
closed that's just unbelievable

152
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,899
yeah who's ever happened to a whole

153
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,820
country totally crazy well we don't

154
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,339
really like to know anything about it

155
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,990
like your personal experience I think

156
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,720
it'd be really interesting because no

157
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,630
score was sent to effect you to work as

158
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,240
a laborer yeah ten years hard time

159
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,459
that's it but I feel like there's more

160
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,670
than just like we know that what we do

161
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:25,560
you know that's on the other side it

162
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,399
made me even stronger I guess how time

163
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,399
made me stronger

164
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,620
all right no it's my tone your tongue

165
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:43,290
how am I most like you and how does that

166
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,510
scare you oh oh how am I most like you

167
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,320
and how does that scare you seems to be

168
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:52,260
a loaded question you like me yeah and

169
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,459
like how does it scare you or like to

170
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:59,160
read write or like watch trivial

171
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:03,660
question programs like yeah I think but

172
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:06,510
there's no skill me I feel good we have

173
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,790
comedy yeah I guess maybe this question

174
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,640
is trying to ask are there any sort of

175
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:15,720
traits that you don't have that you to

176
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:18,329
possess yeah that you also have accepted

177
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,130
for I mentioned procrastination that's

178
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,440
something you don't have that you're not

179
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,290
a procrastinator so it's like what are

180
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:31,610
traits that you see in me that you also

181
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:31,610
have that you wish weren't there I guess

182
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:44,760
do we spend enough time together

183
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,260
obviously not yeah when you were at the

184
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:53,180
school together only do something

185
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,180
innovative together

186
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:08,839
what's your fondest memory from your

187
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:12,950
childhood and why actually I think I'm

188
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:15,440
on my childhood memory obviously no as I

189
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:19,610
said life that time was very tough for

190
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:35,209
me only some time we could not or even

191
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:38,500
watch movie there's any glimmer my

192
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:42,050
family was kind of poor so is there any

193
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,959
anything you couldn't pull out the only

194
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,940
thing I feel proud of myself so I took

195
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,370
an interest examination got into the

196
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:58,390
best Middle School in Shanghai yeah

197
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:58,390
that's my proudest time yeah no it's not

198
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:11,070
how can I be a bad parent means I'm not

199
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,290
better enough yeah like how can I

200
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,710
improve upon already being the best

201
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,140
parent is what it should say I think

202
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,730
just why is it early I think if you I

203
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,830
want you to take care of yourself better

204
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,710
it's like being a pig it's not about

205
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,450
parenting no but that is because of that

206
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,180
I mean you can't be a parent if you're

207
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,880
not there and in good health and

208
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,950
condition so I would say that's a

209
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:40,790
prerequisite think about Karen being a

210
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:40,790
human I'll maybe try to earn more money

211
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:50,310
enough to bring back all your bread

212
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,830
bread butter and bread yeah we eat

213
00:16:50,310 --> 00:17:02,660
really well we talked about that it's

214
00:16:52,830 --> 00:17:02,660
not about that okay sorry

215
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:18,440
flip that'd be great

216
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,440
I'm kind of a phlegm factory thank you

217
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,600
do you mean of question I can't think

218
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:32,910
about head start okay tell me about a

219
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:37,320
moment that changed you in life then I

220
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:39,780
would say when I got accepted by Chinese

221
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,260
government as a student to study in a

222
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,090
mark

223
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,640
certainly totally changed my life

224
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,750
otherwise you will not be born in this

225
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,420
country and I would not be able to come

226
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,670
out to the outside world to see what

227
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,760
really is like in the United States

228
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,800
because in past you know China always

229
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,790
portrayed America as the bet the worst

230
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,790
enemy of China

231
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,640
q us a chance

232
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:16,250
how did it having me as a father shaped

233
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,960
shape you not shape you having me every

234
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:25,370
shape well you taught me impeccable

235
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:28,640
grammar corrected this card I think that

236
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,190
it's really like I mentioned earlier a

237
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,980
lot of it's instilled in me like a good

238
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:40,490
work ethic and caring about other people

239
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:44,180
that's sheep all right integrity totally

240
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,590
rock-solid integrity how do you think I

241
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,820
would be different if you stayed in

242
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:53,480
China if I stay don't you stay if you

243
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:57,350
stay there how would I be different you

244
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:04,570
will not be coming to this world I mean

245
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:06,980
China's only sign already your president

246
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,350
this interview would look like this yes

247
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,590
second chapter you will be talking tears

248
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:17,330
I hope you know you look crazy okay

249
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:21,950
that's cool okay what's the one quality

250
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:26,690
you have you you never want me to change

251
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:33,500
and why one quality you never want me to

252
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:43,910
change my humor even if you wanted to

253
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:47,780
change no okay I can tell one more thing

254
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:49,490
yeah oh this after I went to swim in a

255
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,130
pool the first time I went to the

256
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,960
Metropolitan Avenue swim before and I

257
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,530
asked her later inside the water is

258
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,130
there

259
00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:00,230
fast and slow land difference she said

260
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:05,500
why this is this Medianet I like this

261
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,500
for mediocre people she said no no no no

262
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,940
humor goes over people's head but not my

263
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,860
head because I think it's the best

264
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:28,730
what's the hardest thing about being a

265
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:36,170
father thing I guess just tried to be

266
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:46,310
honest so sometimes it's a necessary not

267
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:48,320
to tell the truth at work yesterday this

268
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:50,810
woman came in with her daughter and we

269
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,360
have a roof with a pool at the

270
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:55,730
restaurant and she told me to tell her

271
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,140
daughter she told me she was like can I

272
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,370
ask you a question like can you do a

273
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,260
favor for me and I was like what's going

274
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,240
on this is weird and she's like can you

275
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,760
tell my daughter that the pool is closed

276
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,200
even though I was open so that I like

277
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,580
wintered the daughter and told her at

278
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,630
the pool was closed and she was crying

279
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:14,090
it seemed like a pretty crazy thing to

280
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,250
ask a waitress actually this mother

281
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,560
should be sued no I was like more of my

282
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,330
moral compass that's a little bit off

283
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:26,440
but then she told me if they're under

284
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,440
five it's okay to lie to them okay now

285
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,240
it's your toes turn let's see

286
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:40,280
thank you once okay so I think it's my

287
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:46,130
turn what do you think I forget or fail

288
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:52,150
to notice about myself and you we talked

289
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:54,980
about taking care of myself again I

290
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:59,170
forget or fail to notice about myself

291
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,170
yeah I think that I think

292
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:11,740
not to eat any crap food yeah except now

293
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,210
I think you're aware of that as you just

294
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:18,850
said that makes me think like you're

295
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:27,460
aware but you still do it I think you

296
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:29,740
forget if you could change one thing

297
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:43,060
about me aside for me waitressing right

298
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:44,710
now what would it be and why maybe also

299
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,950
just you need to take care yourself you

300
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:51,550
always urge you to put on enough closes

301
00:22:47,950 --> 00:23:02,950
if the temperature gets cold right you

302
00:22:51,550 --> 00:23:04,600
need to pay a tax right yeah that's a

303
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:12,310
pretty easy change I'll just wear socks

304
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:15,340
worth when what was the toughest

305
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:18,160
toughest toughest moment in our

306
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:22,240
relationship and how do you feel about

307
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:31,090
it now what was the toughest moment in

308
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:36,610
our relationship any like a special

309
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:39,400
milestone of toughness this day maybe

310
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:43,600
just the fact that you were in New York

311
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:51,460
and we were in Alabama that's tough when

312
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:55,510
you were young right yeah that's because

313
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:58,600
I had to find a job on Obama that's why

314
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:04,180
I don't okay what are you worried about

315
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,480
for me and my future aside from being

316
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,240
waitressing forever

317
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,980
you need to be decisive right sometimes

318
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,290
you to be too hesitant to do yeah you'll

319
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:19,100
always feel difficult making choice

320
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:22,750
making right decisions have this quality

321
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,750
the decisiveness

322
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:41,360
what's a pain in me you would like to

323
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:47,210
hear is this kind of a metaphor looking

324
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:49,700
is a real thing or metaphor I feel like

325
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:59,270
it probably comes encompasses emotional

326
00:24:49,700 --> 00:25:05,720
pain whatsapp if I could erase your bad

327
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:11,090
childhood I would do that do you think

328
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:14,090
I'll be a good mother and wife I will

329
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:17,360
rather hold on to the judgment for them

330
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:20,870
which as the blood you did to Hillary

331
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:28,670
Clinton hold on his endorsement so you

332
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:35,420
have to prove yourself to be I cannot

333
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:54,260
endorse you for the moment why do you

334
00:25:35,420 --> 00:26:00,290
love me what's your absolute favorite

335
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:03,860
thing about me I'll see you understand

336
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,780
all my jokes next thing I like right as

337
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,510
you say sometimes I went to a place

338
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:16,130
taking it 20 and joke people will just

339
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:19,850
look and have kids to have an audience

340
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:24,049
y'all know the same jokes yeah that's

341
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:34,910
kind of understanding okay so there

342
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:48,440
shall be no more question yes there

343
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:50,659
should be a waiter standing here you

344
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:59,440
mean you producer person right on the

345
00:26:50,659 --> 00:27:01,730
spot what do you most admire about me I

346
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,679
feel like we had a variation on this

347
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:08,990
question buddy and I would say still

348
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:14,750
here your work ethic and integrity is

349
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:17,150
very admirable and inspiration what

350
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:22,580
experience did you miss out on by being

351
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:26,120
a father I guess I would miss if there

352
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:32,929
could never be a millionaire like Donald

353
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:34,220
Trump to have a private jet I think

354
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:40,190
you're missing out on that just because

355
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:41,240
of us and not can never provide that

356
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,179
kind of luxury

357
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,100
yeah oh but no it says what experience

358
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,260
did you miss out on by being a father

359
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,059
like because you've had us like what

360
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,580
were you not able to do because you had

361
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,870
to really hear about us yeah I think

362
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,850
that's what it's trying to say that's

363
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:01,220
how it's like you know maybe why should

364
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,740
I miss out anything if I'm a father

365
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,159
right I'm a happy to have one son one

366
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,110
daughter

367
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,780
that's perfect combination you cannot

368
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,789
ask for more even the prince and

369
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:15,100
princesses only gather just son or

370
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:20,659
daughter just recently we have earlier

371
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:23,710
totally one-up that British royalty all

372
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,710
right that's the end of discussion

373
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:48,170
you have any question how you got into

374
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:51,200
this idea for me I feel obliged to to

375
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:54,280
obey to follow this is yeah this whole

376
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,390
experiment is just about following rules

377
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,630
but looks at it's it's a good thing

378
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,390
right

379
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,669
we never take the same chance at home to

380
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,429
talk to each other seriously so it gives

381
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:08,710
us a good opportunity to face each other

382
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:08,710
now face a nation face each other
