0:00:13.940,0:00:37.290
what's your favorite childhood memory

0:00:17.190,0:00:39.620
and why anything you took part in a swim

0:00:37.290,0:00:39.620
team

0:00:50.450,0:00:59.870
what do you think my favorite childhood

0:00:52.739,0:00:59.870
memory is what about visiting China

0:01:10.340,0:01:21.690
like just playing outside I'm not good

0:01:18.090,0:01:24.300
at remembering my childhood I learned to

0:01:21.690,0:01:27.960
ride a bicycle yeah that was good I

0:01:24.300,0:01:31.410
remember how you took my training wheels

0:01:27.960,0:01:39.780
off right well the first thing to teach

0:01:31.410,0:01:44.670
you is that you know I can still ride a

0:01:39.780,0:01:48.930
bike what's the most fun you've had with

0:01:44.670,0:01:52.590
me and why okay I think I should need to

0:01:48.930,0:01:55.380
think about watching jeopardy or try to

0:01:52.590,0:01:57.930
prove that we are the smartest import in

0:01:55.380,0:02:00.479
the world let's share I look for it

0:01:57.930,0:02:08.300
actually yes it's more corrector than

0:02:00.479,0:02:08.300
I've learned from the best

0:02:11.900,0:02:19.080
what's the most ridiculous thing I have

0:02:14.850,0:02:20.489
done what did it teach you about me I

0:02:19.080,0:02:29.459
don't think I've ever done anything

0:02:20.489,0:02:33.300
ridiculous okay sure I think tricky

0:02:29.459,0:02:35.250
waters I think right now something

0:02:33.300,0:02:45.030
ridiculous you're doing is digging our

0:02:35.250,0:02:48.890
basement another person told you I need

0:02:45.030,0:02:48.890
to take out the trash to avoid

0:03:01.390,0:03:09.500
tell me what you remember from the first

0:03:04.340,0:03:12.110
time we met and how it felt horrible so

0:03:09.500,0:03:18.550
who do you were born to this world yeah

0:03:12.110,0:03:26.330
how did that work it was one of the most

0:03:18.550,0:03:29.770
proudest moments I would probably look

0:03:26.330,0:03:33.200
at disgusting and covered in crab right

0:03:29.770,0:03:35.720
as I remember your first smart then you

0:03:33.200,0:03:39.110
start to cry before you cry you first

0:03:35.720,0:03:43.850
why that's an emotional rollercoaster

0:03:39.110,0:03:52.600
birth is exciting and then right now I

0:03:43.850,0:03:52.600
think what are you hesitant to tell me

0:03:58.390,0:04:08.720
something wrong I think maybe talking

0:04:06.860,0:04:10.850
about my emotions but I'm pretty

0:04:08.720,0:04:16.640
hesitant to talk about my emotions with

0:04:10.850,0:04:21.040
anybody you tried to conceal something

0:04:16.640,0:04:21.040
right no not really

0:04:22.330,0:04:28.190
what are the three funniest but that's

0:04:25.880,0:04:36.130
crossed out now it says best memories

0:04:28.190,0:04:40.130
that we shared when we went to China

0:04:36.130,0:04:46.600
together twice yeah the second time so

0:04:40.130,0:04:49.310
that counting is two of the three I

0:04:46.600,0:04:52.010
introduced many Chinese attractions to

0:04:49.310,0:04:56.480
you yeah including that wax museum that

0:04:52.010,0:05:00.580
you hated okay Dee Sangha you only had

0:04:56.480,0:05:00.580
to do we need to say sorry

0:05:03.810,0:05:11.530
they're filming us we have to you have

0:05:07.360,0:05:15.729
to get all three of us good thing to do

0:05:11.530,0:05:18.340
Oh again this time we do it toward

0:05:15.729,0:05:19.300
France for the first time it's true it

0:05:18.340,0:05:24.360
was very good

0:05:19.300,0:05:24.360
it seems like many of them are together

0:05:28.979,0:05:44.669
now if you would wish one thing for me

0:05:36.340,0:05:44.669
what would it to be one thing for me to

0:05:51.990,0:06:44.319
do going back to me emotions question

0:06:40.000,0:06:48.759
clearly when was the time you're proud

0:06:44.319,0:06:51.069
of me and why and obviously I know when

0:06:48.759,0:06:54.159
you work in the White House that made me

0:06:51.069,0:06:57.069
so happy at the top of this world

0:06:54.159,0:06:58.840
yeah and for that we were even able to

0:06:57.069,0:07:02.909
visit the Oval Office

0:06:58.840,0:07:02.909
everybody will have this chance

0:07:09.329,0:07:13.559
what's that my time yeah okay

0:07:14.159,0:07:26.349
what do you think my best qualities is a

0:07:18.219,0:07:30.659
father there's enough digital tape to

0:07:26.349,0:07:35.309
roll this could go for hours you're

0:07:30.659,0:07:37.929
extremely integral and intelligent and

0:07:35.309,0:07:40.539
have such a strong work ethic that I

0:07:37.929,0:07:42.339
think is really inspirational yeah

0:07:40.539,0:07:45.579
there's like a million things you're

0:07:42.339,0:07:56.229
funny you pursue things that you believe

0:07:45.579,0:07:57.999
in you're honest what have I done or

0:07:56.229,0:08:00.839
what happened to me that scared you the

0:07:57.999,0:08:00.839
most and why

0:08:00.899,0:08:07.049
remember I told you not to walk late

0:08:04.959,0:08:10.209
night

0:08:07.049,0:08:12.219
if there's no more bus city bus you can

0:08:12.219,0:08:21.819

0:08:32.199,0:08:40.659
actually Thanks sorry that's okay I

0:08:39.189,0:08:47.280
think it'll be something more than this

0:08:40.659,0:08:55.210
actually Thanks no it's my turn

0:08:47.280,0:08:58.720
yeah I have industrial-grade it's not so

0:08:55.210,0:09:07.660
this is perfect what do you think is

0:08:58.720,0:09:12.040
special about already I think you're

0:09:07.660,0:09:16.870
right yeah right so what do you think is

0:09:12.040,0:09:18.490
special about our relationship I don't

0:09:16.870,0:09:20.380
know I think we have a lot of common

0:09:18.490,0:09:23.740
interests which sometimes is unusual

0:09:20.380,0:09:26.260
between parent and child so that's

0:09:23.740,0:09:38.770
special what do you think is special

0:09:26.260,0:09:42.010
mm-hmm no animosity true and also pipe

0:09:38.770,0:09:43.870
something as you understand even every

0:09:42.010,0:09:52.060
day night we cook Mew together we

0:09:43.870,0:09:56.680
cooperate so we're cooking dream team

0:09:52.060,0:09:58.930
everyone is invited to partake if you

0:09:56.680,0:09:59.710
could go back in time what would you

0:09:58.930,0:10:02.290
change

0:09:59.710,0:10:06.240
I don't know if this question means like

0:10:02.290,0:10:10.000
everything like you could kill Hitler or

0:10:06.240,0:10:11.650
that pertains to our life that's certain

0:10:10.000,0:10:13.810
you would have regret all the time

0:10:11.650,0:10:15.820
something would think if I do it again I

0:10:13.810,0:10:25.390
would do different yeah yeah is there

0:10:15.820,0:10:27.970
like a specific thing specific progress

0:10:25.390,0:10:36.640
or not sometimes should not push people

0:10:27.970,0:10:41.800
so hard a little bit patient just a

0:10:36.640,0:10:49.030
little bit when I try occasion road-rage

0:10:41.800,0:10:51.330
less what's the greatest lesson I taught

0:10:49.030,0:10:51.330
you

0:10:53.300,0:11:00.649
I think being an integral person who

0:10:56.300,0:11:03.470
works really hard for not really for

0:11:00.649,0:11:05.589
other people but for yourself and for

0:11:03.470,0:11:08.089
other people obviously you do it for us

0:11:05.589,0:11:12.260
putting yeah I don't know a lot of

0:11:08.089,0:11:15.140
things and be persistent yeah no Brooke

0:11:12.260,0:11:17.899
what's the word Prague Prague now what's

0:11:15.140,0:11:20.600
always daily always progressive

0:11:17.899,0:11:22.329
progressive which is of course how do

0:11:20.600,0:11:25.040
you feel about my procrastination

0:11:22.329,0:11:32.390
progress dick right procrastination

0:11:25.040,0:11:36.200
procrastination okay what's one lesson

0:11:32.390,0:11:39.440
or idea you want me to never forget said

0:11:36.200,0:11:51.589
again what one lesson our idea you you

0:11:39.440,0:11:57.250
want me to never forget I would say just

0:11:51.589,0:12:01.510
try to pursue your own dream or go

0:11:57.250,0:12:05.690
processing today never be afraid of any

0:12:01.510,0:12:07.899
difficulties even if my dream is to be a

0:12:05.690,0:12:07.899
waitress

0:12:11.500,0:12:30.250
okay so there's an asterisk what's a

0:12:25.790,0:12:33.740
question you always wanted to ask me I

0:12:30.250,0:12:37.540
think I always want to ask you about

0:12:33.740,0:12:40.300
your like your childhood in your history

0:12:37.540,0:12:42.560
like always curious to know more

0:12:40.300,0:12:44.990
especially cultural revolution like

0:12:42.560,0:12:47.750
where things happen during your time

0:12:44.990,0:12:49.200
even to today I could not believe that

0:12:47.750,0:12:51.360
happened to me

0:12:49.200,0:12:55.430
yeah I want to hear I feel like me and

0:12:51.360,0:12:58.139
how en don't know like even close to

0:12:55.430,0:13:00.029
some of this stuff the schools were

0:12:58.139,0:13:01.410
closed that's just unbelievable

0:13:00.029,0:13:03.899
yeah who's ever happened to a whole

0:13:01.410,0:13:05.820
country totally crazy well we don't

0:13:03.899,0:13:08.339
really like to know anything about it

0:13:05.820,0:13:09.990
like your personal experience I think

0:13:08.339,0:13:12.720
it'd be really interesting because no

0:13:09.990,0:13:15.630
score was sent to effect you to work as

0:13:12.720,0:13:18.240
a laborer yeah ten years hard time

0:13:15.630,0:13:20.459
that's it but I feel like there's more

0:13:18.240,0:13:22.670
than just like we know that what we do

0:13:20.459,0:13:25.560
you know that's on the other side it

0:13:22.670,0:13:28.399
made me even stronger I guess how time

0:13:25.560,0:13:28.399
made me stronger

0:13:28.639,0:13:33.620
all right no it's my tone your tongue

0:13:35.750,0:13:43.290
how am I most like you and how does that

0:13:38.639,0:13:45.510
scare you oh oh how am I most like you

0:13:43.290,0:13:49.320
and how does that scare you seems to be

0:13:45.510,0:13:52.260
a loaded question you like me yeah and

0:13:49.320,0:13:56.459
like how does it scare you or like to

0:13:52.260,0:13:59.160
read write or like watch trivial

0:13:56.459,0:14:03.660
question programs like yeah I think but

0:13:59.160,0:14:06.510
there's no skill me I feel good we have

0:14:03.660,0:14:08.790
comedy yeah I guess maybe this question

0:14:06.510,0:14:11.640
is trying to ask are there any sort of

0:14:08.790,0:14:15.720
traits that you don't have that you to

0:14:11.640,0:14:18.329
possess yeah that you also have accepted

0:14:15.720,0:14:20.130
for I mentioned procrastination that's

0:14:18.329,0:14:22.440
something you don't have that you're not

0:14:20.130,0:14:25.290
a procrastinator so it's like what are

0:14:22.440,0:14:31.610
traits that you see in me that you also

0:14:25.290,0:14:31.610
have that you wish weren't there I guess

0:14:36.589,0:14:44.760
do we spend enough time together

0:14:41.600,0:14:49.260
obviously not yeah when you were at the

0:14:44.760,0:14:53.180
school together only do something

0:14:49.260,0:14:53.180
innovative together

0:14:58.570,0:15:08.839
what's your fondest memory from your

0:15:00.860,0:15:12.950
childhood and why actually I think I'm

0:15:08.839,0:15:15.440
on my childhood memory obviously no as I

0:15:12.950,0:15:19.610
said life that time was very tough for

0:15:15.440,0:15:35.209
me only some time we could not or even

0:15:19.610,0:15:38.500
watch movie there's any glimmer my

0:15:35.209,0:15:42.050
family was kind of poor so is there any

0:15:38.500,0:15:44.959
anything you couldn't pull out the only

0:15:42.050,0:15:46.940
thing I feel proud of myself so I took

0:15:44.959,0:15:49.370
an interest examination got into the

0:15:46.940,0:15:58.390
best Middle School in Shanghai yeah

0:15:49.370,0:15:58.390
that's my proudest time yeah no it's not

0:16:00.990,0:16:11.070
how can I be a bad parent means I'm not

0:16:07.980,0:16:13.290
better enough yeah like how can I

0:16:11.070,0:16:16.710
improve upon already being the best

0:16:13.290,0:16:19.140
parent is what it should say I think

0:16:16.710,0:16:20.730
just why is it early I think if you I

0:16:19.140,0:16:22.830
want you to take care of yourself better

0:16:20.730,0:16:25.710
it's like being a pig it's not about

0:16:22.830,0:16:27.450
parenting no but that is because of that

0:16:25.710,0:16:30.180
I mean you can't be a parent if you're

0:16:27.450,0:16:32.880
not there and in good health and

0:16:30.180,0:16:34.950
condition so I would say that's a

0:16:32.880,0:16:40.790
prerequisite think about Karen being a

0:16:34.950,0:16:40.790
human I'll maybe try to earn more money

0:16:42.470,0:16:50.310
enough to bring back all your bread

0:16:46.460,0:16:52.830
bread butter and bread yeah we eat

0:16:50.310,0:17:02.660
really well we talked about that it's

0:16:52.830,0:17:02.660
not about that okay sorry

0:17:11.270,0:17:18.440
flip that'd be great

0:17:13.920,0:17:18.440
I'm kind of a phlegm factory thank you

0:17:20.900,0:17:27.600
do you mean of question I can't think

0:17:23.339,0:17:32.910
about head start okay tell me about a

0:17:27.600,0:17:37.320
moment that changed you in life then I

0:17:32.910,0:17:39.780
would say when I got accepted by Chinese

0:17:37.320,0:17:40.260
government as a student to study in a

0:17:39.780,0:17:42.090
mark

0:17:40.260,0:17:44.640
certainly totally changed my life

0:17:42.090,0:17:48.750
otherwise you will not be born in this

0:17:44.640,0:17:51.420
country and I would not be able to come

0:17:48.750,0:17:53.670
out to the outside world to see what

0:17:51.420,0:17:56.760
really is like in the United States

0:17:53.670,0:17:58.800
because in past you know China always

0:17:56.760,0:18:01.790
portrayed America as the bet the worst

0:17:58.800,0:18:01.790
enemy of China

0:18:02.620,0:18:06.640
q us a chance

0:18:09.490,0:18:16.250
how did it having me as a father shaped

0:18:12.650,0:18:17.960
shape you not shape you having me every

0:18:16.250,0:18:25.370
shape well you taught me impeccable

0:18:17.960,0:18:28.640
grammar corrected this card I think that

0:18:25.370,0:18:31.190
it's really like I mentioned earlier a

0:18:28.640,0:18:35.980
lot of it's instilled in me like a good

0:18:31.190,0:18:40.490
work ethic and caring about other people

0:18:35.980,0:18:44.180
that's sheep all right integrity totally

0:18:40.490,0:18:45.590
rock-solid integrity how do you think I

0:18:44.180,0:18:49.820
would be different if you stayed in

0:18:45.590,0:18:53.480
China if I stay don't you stay if you

0:18:49.820,0:18:57.350
stay there how would I be different you

0:18:53.480,0:19:04.570
will not be coming to this world I mean

0:18:57.350,0:19:06.980
China's only sign already your president

0:19:04.570,0:19:09.350
this interview would look like this yes

0:19:06.980,0:19:12.590
second chapter you will be talking tears

0:19:09.350,0:19:17.330
I hope you know you look crazy okay

0:19:12.590,0:19:21.950
that's cool okay what's the one quality

0:19:17.330,0:19:26.690
you have you you never want me to change

0:19:21.950,0:19:33.500
and why one quality you never want me to

0:19:26.690,0:19:43.910
change my humor even if you wanted to

0:19:33.500,0:19:47.780
change no okay I can tell one more thing

0:19:43.910,0:19:49.490
yeah oh this after I went to swim in a

0:19:47.780,0:19:52.130
pool the first time I went to the

0:19:49.490,0:19:53.960
Metropolitan Avenue swim before and I

0:19:52.130,0:19:54.530
asked her later inside the water is

0:19:53.960,0:19:58.130
there

0:19:54.530,0:20:00.230
fast and slow land difference she said

0:19:58.130,0:20:05.500
why this is this Medianet I like this

0:20:00.230,0:20:05.500
for mediocre people she said no no no no

0:20:11.030,0:20:15.940
humor goes over people's head but not my

0:20:13.220,0:20:18.860
head because I think it's the best

0:20:15.940,0:20:28.730
what's the hardest thing about being a

0:20:18.860,0:20:36.170
father thing I guess just tried to be

0:20:28.730,0:20:46.310
honest so sometimes it's a necessary not

0:20:36.170,0:20:48.320
to tell the truth at work yesterday this

0:20:46.310,0:20:50.810
woman came in with her daughter and we

0:20:48.320,0:20:53.360
have a roof with a pool at the

0:20:50.810,0:20:55.730
restaurant and she told me to tell her

0:20:53.360,0:20:57.140
daughter she told me she was like can I

0:20:55.730,0:20:58.370
ask you a question like can you do a

0:20:57.140,0:21:00.260
favor for me and I was like what's going

0:20:58.370,0:21:02.240
on this is weird and she's like can you

0:21:00.260,0:21:04.760
tell my daughter that the pool is closed

0:21:02.240,0:21:06.200
even though I was open so that I like

0:21:04.760,0:21:07.580
wintered the daughter and told her at

0:21:06.200,0:21:11.630
the pool was closed and she was crying

0:21:07.580,0:21:14.090
it seemed like a pretty crazy thing to

0:21:11.630,0:21:16.250
ask a waitress actually this mother

0:21:14.090,0:21:18.560
should be sued no I was like more of my

0:21:16.250,0:21:20.330
moral compass that's a little bit off

0:21:18.560,0:21:26.440
but then she told me if they're under

0:21:20.330,0:21:26.440
five it's okay to lie to them okay now

0:21:26.500,0:21:32.240
it's your toes turn let's see

0:21:29.240,0:21:40.280
thank you once okay so I think it's my

0:21:32.240,0:21:46.130
turn what do you think I forget or fail

0:21:40.280,0:21:52.150
to notice about myself and you we talked

0:21:46.130,0:21:54.980
about taking care of myself again I

0:21:52.150,0:21:59.170
forget or fail to notice about myself

0:21:54.980,0:21:59.170
yeah I think that I think

0:22:03.840,0:22:11.740
not to eat any crap food yeah except now

0:22:10.090,0:22:13.210
I think you're aware of that as you just

0:22:11.740,0:22:18.850
said that makes me think like you're

0:22:13.210,0:22:27.460
aware but you still do it I think you

0:22:18.850,0:22:29.740
forget if you could change one thing

0:22:27.460,0:22:43.060
about me aside for me waitressing right

0:22:29.740,0:22:44.710
now what would it be and why maybe also

0:22:43.060,0:22:47.950
just you need to take care yourself you

0:22:44.710,0:22:51.550
always urge you to put on enough closes

0:22:47.950,0:23:02.950
if the temperature gets cold right you

0:22:51.550,0:23:04.600
need to pay a tax right yeah that's a

0:23:02.950,0:23:12.310
pretty easy change I'll just wear socks

0:23:04.600,0:23:15.340
worth when what was the toughest

0:23:12.310,0:23:18.160
toughest toughest moment in our

0:23:15.340,0:23:22.240
relationship and how do you feel about

0:23:18.160,0:23:31.090
it now what was the toughest moment in

0:23:22.240,0:23:36.610
our relationship any like a special

0:23:31.090,0:23:39.400
milestone of toughness this day maybe

0:23:36.610,0:23:43.600
just the fact that you were in New York

0:23:39.400,0:23:51.460
and we were in Alabama that's tough when

0:23:43.600,0:23:55.510
you were young right yeah that's because

0:23:51.460,0:23:58.600
I had to find a job on Obama that's why

0:23:55.510,0:24:04.180
I don't okay what are you worried about

0:23:58.600,0:24:05.480
for me and my future aside from being

0:24:04.180,0:24:08.240
waitressing forever

0:24:05.480,0:24:12.980
you need to be decisive right sometimes

0:24:08.240,0:24:15.290
you to be too hesitant to do yeah you'll

0:24:12.980,0:24:19.100
always feel difficult making choice

0:24:15.290,0:24:22.750
making right decisions have this quality

0:24:19.100,0:24:22.750
the decisiveness

0:24:27.280,0:24:41.360
what's a pain in me you would like to

0:24:31.880,0:24:47.210
hear is this kind of a metaphor looking

0:24:41.360,0:24:49.700
is a real thing or metaphor I feel like

0:24:47.210,0:24:59.270
it probably comes encompasses emotional

0:24:49.700,0:25:05.720
pain whatsapp if I could erase your bad

0:24:59.270,0:25:11.090
childhood I would do that do you think

0:25:05.720,0:25:14.090
I'll be a good mother and wife I will

0:25:11.090,0:25:17.360
rather hold on to the judgment for them

0:25:14.090,0:25:20.870
which as the blood you did to Hillary

0:25:17.360,0:25:28.670
Clinton hold on his endorsement so you

0:25:20.870,0:25:35.420
have to prove yourself to be I cannot

0:25:28.670,0:25:54.260
endorse you for the moment why do you

0:25:35.420,0:26:00.290
love me what's your absolute favorite

0:25:54.260,0:26:03.860
thing about me I'll see you understand

0:26:00.290,0:26:05.780
all my jokes next thing I like right as

0:26:03.860,0:26:08.510
you say sometimes I went to a place

0:26:05.780,0:26:16.130
taking it 20 and joke people will just

0:26:08.510,0:26:19.850
look and have kids to have an audience

0:26:16.130,0:26:24.049
y'all know the same jokes yeah that's

0:26:19.850,0:26:34.910
kind of understanding okay so there

0:26:24.049,0:26:48.440
shall be no more question yes there

0:26:34.910,0:26:50.659
should be a waiter standing here you

0:26:48.440,0:26:59.440
mean you producer person right on the

0:26:50.659,0:27:01.730
spot what do you most admire about me I

0:26:59.440,0:27:03.679
feel like we had a variation on this

0:27:01.730,0:27:08.990
question buddy and I would say still

0:27:03.679,0:27:14.750
here your work ethic and integrity is

0:27:08.990,0:27:17.150
very admirable and inspiration what

0:27:14.750,0:27:22.580
experience did you miss out on by being

0:27:17.150,0:27:26.120
a father I guess I would miss if there

0:27:22.580,0:27:32.929
could never be a millionaire like Donald

0:27:26.120,0:27:34.220
Trump to have a private jet I think

0:27:32.929,0:27:40.190
you're missing out on that just because

0:27:34.220,0:27:41.240
of us and not can never provide that

0:27:40.190,0:27:44.179
kind of luxury

0:27:41.240,0:27:46.100
yeah oh but no it says what experience

0:27:44.179,0:27:48.260
did you miss out on by being a father

0:27:46.100,0:27:50.059
like because you've had us like what

0:27:48.260,0:27:52.580
were you not able to do because you had

0:27:50.059,0:27:53.870
to really hear about us yeah I think

0:27:52.580,0:27:58.850
that's what it's trying to say that's

0:27:53.870,0:28:01.220
how it's like you know maybe why should

0:27:58.850,0:28:03.740
I miss out anything if I'm a father

0:28:01.220,0:28:04.159
right I'm a happy to have one son one

0:28:03.740,0:28:06.110
daughter

0:28:04.159,0:28:08.780
that's perfect combination you cannot

0:28:06.110,0:28:10.789
ask for more even the prince and

0:28:08.780,0:28:15.100
princesses only gather just son or

0:28:10.789,0:28:20.659
daughter just recently we have earlier

0:28:15.100,0:28:23.710
totally one-up that British royalty all

0:28:20.659,0:28:23.710
right that's the end of discussion

0:28:26.170,0:28:48.170
you have any question how you got into

0:28:41.840,0:28:51.200
this idea for me I feel obliged to to

0:28:48.170,0:28:54.280
obey to follow this is yeah this whole

0:28:51.200,0:28:56.390
experiment is just about following rules

0:28:54.280,0:28:56.630
but looks at it's it's a good thing

0:28:56.390,0:28:59.390
right

0:28:56.630,0:29:01.669
we never take the same chance at home to

0:28:59.390,0:29:04.429
talk to each other seriously so it gives

0:29:01.669,0:29:08.710
us a good opportunity to face each other

0:29:04.429,0:29:08.710
now face a nation face each other
