comforting to have those things I'm a

0:02:54.880,0:02:58.750

a schedule ish I don't know I just I

0:03:07.299,0:03:11.650
like that I like that sort of like it

0:03:10.120,0:03:14.400
doesn't feel monotonous to me it feels

0:03:11.650,0:03:14.400
good

0:03:18.670,0:03:52.270
when do you feel closest to me what are

0:03:46.010,0:03:52.270
you hesitant to tell me nothing

0:03:53.770,0:04:00.100
yeah no I feel like I'm sure I feel like

0:03:58.250,0:04:02.570
if you asked me that question Linc

0:04:00.100,0:04:05.270
six months ago I probably would have had

0:04:02.570,0:04:07.450
stuff to say but for that guys to say

0:04:05.270,0:04:07.450
now

0:04:14.040,0:04:20.579
tell me about the time I disappointed

0:04:16.630,0:04:20.579
you and how you feel about it now

0:04:25.540,0:04:35.620
I would say it was when you got casted

0:04:32.010,0:04:37.870
for the show and like you went to your

0:04:35.620,0:04:41.140
house and like you I was they've said

0:04:37.870,0:04:44.650
but it was like you didn't understand

0:04:41.140,0:04:46.240
like how things are playing now and I

0:04:44.650,0:04:49.300
was trying to like tell you that

0:04:46.240,0:04:53.320
well like you were still like so set on

0:04:49.300,0:04:55.210
like oh I can't do this and I can't do

0:04:53.320,0:04:57.850
that no one gets that like upset at me

0:04:55.210,0:05:00.490
or disappointed me the most but I'm now

0:04:57.850,0:05:04.540
I'm like we're done like you're like on

0:05:00.490,0:05:09.720
born now and you're like so like into it

0:05:04.540,0:05:09.720
now so like it's everything is SS Joe I

0:05:09.840,0:05:16.200
know except in like a week but everyone

0:05:13.990,0:05:16.200
void

0:05:26.210,0:05:31.090
why are you going to miss me after high

0:05:29.060,0:05:31.090
school

0:05:36.930,0:05:39.930
cuz

0:05:40.430,0:05:48.530
because I like I don't hate change but I

0:05:46.419,0:06:08.020
just got really comfortable with things

0:05:48.530,0:06:08.020
and and because that's cuz

0:06:20.960,0:06:27.139
why are we making it work right now

0:06:24.490,0:06:32.389
right now no one liked this circumstance

0:06:27.139,0:06:34.720
of like down the road I don't I don't

0:06:32.389,0:06:34.720
have any

0:06:42.530,0:06:46.880
I mean I don't think we're making work I

0:06:44.990,0:06:47.210
think it works because we love each

0:06:46.880,0:06:50.780
other

0:06:47.210,0:06:53.390
mm-hmm I don't it was like a question

0:06:50.780,0:06:55.490
about like why would make it work now

0:06:53.390,0:06:58.460
knowing that like we're gonna miss each

0:06:55.490,0:07:00.650
other at the high school mm-hmm I would

0:06:58.460,0:07:03.470
say it's just because like I'm really

0:07:00.650,0:07:07.130
happy right now and like just because I

0:07:03.470,0:07:10.370
know that like that happiness might end

0:07:07.130,0:07:13.070
at the end of like August or whatever

0:07:10.370,0:07:15.430
like I still want to be happy and I'm

0:07:13.070,0:07:15.430
happy

0:07:25.080,0:07:30.599
and the coming months before graduation

0:07:27.349,0:07:32.580
what do you want from me I hate all

0:07:30.599,0:07:35.000
these questions I think all these

0:07:32.580,0:07:40.610
questions about like leaving and like

0:07:35.000,0:07:43.500
ending and I don't know I don't there's

0:07:40.610,0:07:48.659
nothing I like want from you you're like

0:07:43.500,0:07:50.129
you're just you're you and like

0:07:48.659,0:07:55.050
everything that our relationship is like

0:07:50.129,0:07:57.620
right now I don't know I don't know the

0:07:55.050,0:07:57.620
answer to that question

0:08:10.889,0:08:14.000
can skip this one

0:08:56.850,0:09:21.939
to answer that question the best I could

0:08:59.079,0:09:23.799
I would say do you think we'll ever get

0:09:21.939,0:09:25.829
back together at some point in the

0:09:23.799,0:09:25.829
future

0:09:54.529,0:10:03.759
do you know what I thought you're

0:09:57.289,0:10:07.159
supposed to be answering it I'm not sure

0:10:03.759,0:10:08.599
this is different from saying do I want

0:10:07.159,0:10:10.459
us to get back together in the future

0:10:08.599,0:10:14.029
knowing that we're gonna go our separate

0:10:10.459,0:10:16.699
ways most likely from college I would I

0:10:14.029,0:10:19.849
would love that but do I think it'll

0:10:16.699,0:10:22.909
happen who knows it depends like they're

0:10:19.849,0:10:25.539
going you know whatever you know if

0:10:22.909,0:10:30.049
that's Massachusetts or like Delaware

0:10:25.539,0:10:33.499
Minnesota and I'm most likely gonna be

0:10:30.049,0:10:35.509
like here in the city I'm sure we'll see

0:10:33.499,0:10:38.149
each other again but like we get back

0:10:35.509,0:10:40.839
together I'm not sure but I would love

0:10:38.149,0:10:40.839
if that happen

0:10:46.520,0:10:51.880
still my time because that was my

0:10:49.670,0:10:51.880
question

0:10:59.860,0:11:06.050
what do you think you missed out on what

0:11:04.850,0:11:15.860
do you think you missed out on a while

0:11:06.050,0:11:19.160
being in this relationship if I had to

0:11:15.860,0:11:22.850
say like something maybe it would it

0:11:19.160,0:11:27.019
would be like me being more socially

0:11:22.850,0:11:32.420
independent you know what I mean cuz

0:11:27.019,0:11:36.260
like I have my own friends but I usually

0:11:32.420,0:11:39.110
like I feel like I cycle out friends

0:11:36.260,0:11:43.149
based on like a relationship I'm in and

0:11:39.110,0:11:45.260
like my significant others friends and

0:11:43.149,0:11:46.820
so I don't like that's not really

0:11:45.260,0:11:48.589
specific to this relationship it's more

0:11:46.820,0:11:50.930
just like what if I missed out on by

0:11:48.589,0:11:53.690
being in relationships is like a chance

0:11:50.930,0:11:56.079
to be socially independent like for

0:11:53.690,0:11:56.079
myself

0:11:59.709,0:12:13.519
why don't you need me anymore I don't

0:12:09.470,0:12:22.279
answer that question me that again

0:12:13.519,0:12:27.980
why don't you need me anymore I don't

0:12:22.279,0:12:38.230
think it's like a matter of like I mean

0:12:27.980,0:12:38.230
do you need okay

0:12:51.020,0:12:56.200
I'm gonna read this burner phone

0:12:56.290,0:13:30.380
perfect babe what are you afraid I could

0:13:02.149,0:13:40.870
become what are you afraid I could

0:13:30.380,0:13:40.870
become in college board I can come boy

0:13:40.930,0:13:51.130
because I like I want you to like do

0:13:44.390,0:13:53.000
things that you want to do and like

0:13:51.130,0:13:55.550
regardless of what other people think

0:13:53.000,0:13:56.450
you should be doing and so I don't want

0:13:55.550,0:14:00.230
you to feel like you're caught in

0:13:56.450,0:14:05.500
something that you had no intention of

0:14:00.230,0:14:05.500
being in and just sort of being stuck

0:14:13.600,0:14:17.000
what's one thing you don't want to

0:14:15.830,0:14:20.020
forget about me

0:14:17.000,0:14:22.040
no you don't want me to forget about you

0:14:20.020,0:14:27.830
what's one thing you don't want me to

0:14:22.040,0:14:28.670
forget about you and I think you're

0:14:27.830,0:14:31.480
special

0:14:28.670,0:14:31.480
I think you

0:14:40.030,0:14:49.600
that's not about you about me yeah

0:14:44.920,0:15:12.340
something about you thought I was like I

0:14:49.600,0:15:20.020
want you to forget that I was cool what

0:15:12.340,0:15:24.220
happens Tyler's me meant to you I don't

0:15:20.020,0:15:25.630
know I mean like it's been really good

0:15:24.220,0:15:31.090
and it's been really challenging and

0:15:25.630,0:15:36.520
it's been really different I think it's

0:15:31.090,0:15:39.790
just meant like a sort of like closing

0:15:36.520,0:15:41.170
of my child out of it I mean I feel like

0:15:39.790,0:15:49.870
my childhood and like a really a long

0:15:41.170,0:15:51.310
time ago but if I had to like say that

0:15:49.870,0:15:53.730
it like meant something and like the

0:15:51.310,0:15:56.050
context of my entire life that's

0:15:53.730,0:16:02.400
probably some meaning I would assign to

0:15:56.050,0:16:02.400
it but I don't I don't know yeah

0:16:08.410,0:16:19.650
how do you feel about me being with

0:16:10.240,0:16:23.560
someone else we had like a problem with

0:16:19.650,0:16:27.550
Jake before like and I've learned from

0:16:23.560,0:16:29.860
that but like now I think I was like at

0:16:27.550,0:16:34.290
that time I think I was immature in a

0:16:29.860,0:16:36.640
way and I didn't like understand but

0:16:34.290,0:16:39.160
being with you longer it's like made me

0:16:36.640,0:16:43.480
realize that like it's great just to

0:16:39.160,0:16:46.960
know you and like I'm okay with knowing

0:16:43.480,0:16:51.180
that like when you find somebody else

0:16:46.960,0:16:51.180
like that she'll be happy and like that

0:16:57.570,0:17:16.150
okay what are you going to take away

0:17:12.160,0:17:19.540
from this relationship um communication

0:17:16.150,0:17:22.420
is really important like really really

0:17:19.540,0:17:28.589
really really really really important

0:17:22.420,0:17:28.589
more important than you think and that

0:17:29.010,0:17:32.830
there are a lot of things that are

0:17:31.180,0:17:34.570
outside of my control

0:17:32.830,0:17:38.950
that I feel like I'm more used to being

0:17:34.570,0:17:41.920
in my control and that sometimes I'll be

0:17:38.950,0:17:43.360
in situations where I don't like have as

0:17:41.920,0:17:47.200
much control as I would like but I have

0:17:43.360,0:17:51.100
to manage it anyways like man it's my

0:17:47.200,0:17:54.780
lack of control yeah that's what I'm

0:17:51.100,0:17:54.780
taking away okay

0:18:02.300,0:18:10.670
crowd questions I'm like mad at you guys

0:18:08.809,0:18:14.290
you like wrote all these questions about

0:18:10.670,0:18:14.290
leaving in high school and I'm like

0:18:43.909,0:18:48.459
yeah I just hate thinking about this

0:18:46.159,0:18:48.459
stuff

0:18:53.250,0:19:00.780
that's always something that's like in

0:18:54.930,0:19:11.120
my head like just kind of like it like

0:19:00.780,0:19:11.120
an expiration date that sucks

0:19:12.050,0:19:18.050
yeah and I feel like it's not just like

0:19:16.100,0:19:21.190
this relationship it's like a lot of

0:19:18.050,0:19:24.640
things like I have to leave home and I

0:19:21.190,0:19:26.870
have to like I feel like I've like I

0:19:24.640,0:19:28.070
figured out high school you know I'm

0:19:26.870,0:19:31.250
just like I've gotten her figured out

0:19:28.070,0:19:32.420
and like I know how it works and now I

0:19:31.250,0:19:34.190
have to leave and go figure out

0:19:32.420,0:19:35.570
something else and that's really

0:19:34.190,0:19:39.800
stressful and I don't even know what it

0:19:35.570,0:19:41.060
is I have to figure out yet how so

0:19:39.800,0:19:42.560
sometimes I just like look at my mom and

0:19:41.060,0:19:45.710
I start crying it's really but that I

0:19:42.560,0:19:56.020
don't like I don't know I hate thinking

0:19:45.710,0:19:56.020
about this stuff I just feel
