29
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,530
comforting to have those things I'm a

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,750

good

39
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:52,270

40
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:52,270
you hesitant to tell me nothing

41
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:00,100
yeah no I feel like I'm sure I feel like

42
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,570
if you asked me that question Linc

43
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,270
six months ago I probably would have had

44
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,450
stuff to say but for that guys to say

45
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,450
now

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,579
tell me about the time I disappointed

47
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,579
you and how you feel about it now

48
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:35,620
I would say it was when you got casted

49
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,870
for the show and like you went to your

50
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,140
house and like you I was they've said

51
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,650
but it was like you didn't understand

52
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,240
like how things are playing now and I

53
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,300
was trying to like tell you that

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,320
well like you were still like so set on

55
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,210
like oh I can't do this and I can't do

56
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,850
that no one gets that like upset at me

57
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,490
or disappointed me the most but I'm now

58
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:04,540
I'm like we're done like you're like on

59
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:09,720
born now and you're like so like into it

60
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,720
now so like it's everything is SS Joe I

61
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,200
know except in like a week but everyone

62
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,200
void

63
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,090
why are you going to miss me after high

64
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,090
school

65
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,930
cuz

66
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:48,530
because I like I don't hate change but I

67
00:05:46,419 --> 00:06:08,020
just got really comfortable with things

68
00:05:48,530 --> 00:06:08,020
and and because that's cuz

69
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,139
why are we making it work right now

70
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:32,389
right now no one liked this circumstance

71
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:34,720
of like down the road I don't I don't

72
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,720
have any

73
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,880
I mean I don't think we're making work I

74
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,210
think it works because we love each

75
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,780
other

76
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:53,390
mm-hmm I don't it was like a question

77
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,490
about like why would make it work now

78
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,460
knowing that like we're gonna miss each

79
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,650
other at the high school mm-hmm I would

80
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,470
say it's just because like I'm really

81
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:07,130
happy right now and like just because I

82
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:10,370
know that like that happiness might end

83
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,070
at the end of like August or whatever

84
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,430
like I still want to be happy and I'm

85
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,430
happy

86
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,599
and the coming months before graduation

87
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:32,580
what do you want from me I hate all

88
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,000
these questions I think all these

89
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:40,610
questions about like leaving and like

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,500
ending and I don't know I don't there's

91
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:48,659
nothing I like want from you you're like

92
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,129
you're just you're you and like

93
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:55,050
everything that our relationship is like

94
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:57,620
right now I don't know I don't know the

95
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,620
answer to that question

96
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,000
can skip this one

97
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:21,939
to answer that question the best I could

98
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:23,799
I would say do you think we'll ever get

99
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:25,829
back together at some point in the

100
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,829
future

101
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:03,759
do you know what I thought you're

102
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:07,159
supposed to be answering it I'm not sure

103
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,599
this is different from saying do I want

104
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,459
us to get back together in the future

105
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:14,029
knowing that we're gonna go our separate

106
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:16,699
ways most likely from college I would I

107
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:19,849
would love that but do I think it'll

108
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:22,909
happen who knows it depends like they're

109
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:25,539
going you know whatever you know if

110
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:30,049
that's Massachusetts or like Delaware

111
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:33,499
Minnesota and I'm most likely gonna be

112
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:35,509
like here in the city I'm sure we'll see

113
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:38,149
each other again but like we get back

114
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:40,839
together I'm not sure but I would love

115
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,839
if that happen

116
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,880
still my time because that was my

117
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,880
question

118
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,050
what do you think you missed out on what

119
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:15,860
do you think you missed out on a while

120
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:19,160
being in this relationship if I had to

121
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,850
say like something maybe it would it

122
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:27,019
would be like me being more socially

123
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:32,420
independent you know what I mean cuz

124
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:36,260
like I have my own friends but I usually

125
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:39,110
like I feel like I cycle out friends

126
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:43,149
based on like a relationship I'm in and

127
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,260
like my significant others friends and

128
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,820
so I don't like that's not really

129
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,589
specific to this relationship it's more

130
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,930
just like what if I missed out on by

131
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,690
being in relationships is like a chance

132
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,079
to be socially independent like for

133
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,079
myself

134
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:13,519
why don't you need me anymore I don't

135
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:22,279
answer that question me that again

136
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:27,980
why don't you need me anymore I don't

137
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:38,230
think it's like a matter of like I mean

138
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:38,230
do you need okay

139
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm gonna read this burner phone

140
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:30,380
perfect babe what are you afraid I could

141
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:40,870
become what are you afraid I could

142
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:40,870
become in college board I can come boy

143
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:51,130
because I like I want you to like do

144
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:53,000
things that you want to do and like

145
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,550
regardless of what other people think

146
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,450
you should be doing and so I don't want

147
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,230
you to feel like you're caught in

148
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:05,500
something that you had no intention of

149
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,500
being in and just sort of being stuck

150
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,000
what's one thing you don't want to

151
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,020
forget about me

152
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,040
no you don't want me to forget about you

153
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:27,830
what's one thing you don't want me to

154
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,670
forget about you and I think you're

155
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,480
special

156
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,480
I think you

157
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:49,600
that's not about you about me yeah

158
00:14:44,920 --> 00:15:12,340
something about you thought I was like I

159
00:14:49,600 --> 00:15:20,020
want you to forget that I was cool what

160
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:24,220
happens Tyler's me meant to you I don't

161
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,630
know I mean like it's been really good

162
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:31,090
and it's been really challenging and

163
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:36,520
it's been really different I think it's

164
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:39,790
just meant like a sort of like closing

165
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,170
of my child out of it I mean I feel like

166
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:49,870
my childhood and like a really a long

167
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:51,310
time ago but if I had to like say that

168
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,730
it like meant something and like the

169
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,050
context of my entire life that's

170
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:02,400
probably some meaning I would assign to

171
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:02,400
it but I don't I don't know yeah

172
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:19,650
how do you feel about me being with

173
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:23,560
someone else we had like a problem with

174
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:27,550
Jake before like and I've learned from

175
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,860
that but like now I think I was like at

176
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:34,290
that time I think I was immature in a

177
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,640
way and I didn't like understand but

178
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,160
being with you longer it's like made me

179
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,480
realize that like it's great just to

180
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:46,960
know you and like I'm okay with knowing

181
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,180
that like when you find somebody else

182
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,180
like that she'll be happy and like that

183
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:16,150
okay what are you going to take away

184
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,540
from this relationship um communication

185
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:22,420
is really important like really really

186
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:28,589
really really really really important

187
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:28,589
more important than you think and that

188
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,830
there are a lot of things that are

189
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,570
outside of my control

190
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,950
that I feel like I'm more used to being

191
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,920
in my control and that sometimes I'll be

192
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,360
in situations where I don't like have as

193
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,200
much control as I would like but I have

194
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,100
to manage it anyways like man it's my

195
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,780
lack of control yeah that's what I'm

196
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,780
taking away okay

197
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:10,670
crowd questions I'm like mad at you guys

198
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,290
you like wrote all these questions about

199
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,290
leaving in high school and I'm like

200
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:48,459
yeah I just hate thinking about this

201
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,459
stuff

202
00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,780
that's always something that's like in

203
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:11,120
my head like just kind of like it like

204
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:11,120
an expiration date that sucks

205
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:18,050
yeah and I feel like it's not just like

206
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,190
this relationship it's like a lot of

207
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,640
things like I have to leave home and I

208
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,870
have to like I feel like I've like I

209
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,070
figured out high school you know I'm

210
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,250
just like I've gotten her figured out

211
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,420
and like I know how it works and now I

212
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,190
have to leave and go figure out

213
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,570
something else and that's really

214
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,800
stressful and I don't even know what it

215
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:41,060
is I have to figure out yet how so

216
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,560
sometimes I just like look at my mom and

217
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,710
I start crying it's really but that I

218
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:56,020
don't like I don't know I hate thinking

219
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:56,020
