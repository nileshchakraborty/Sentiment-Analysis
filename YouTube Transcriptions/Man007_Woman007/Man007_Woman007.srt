1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,829
seconds and then sharpies yes sir

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,550
[Music]

3
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:40,239
what do you want to be when you grow up

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:52,629
well since I'm gonna go sign to me be an

5
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:56,559
engineer but I also like art and journey

6
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:59,820
there in adult dances though if you

7
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,820
don't tell me

8
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:14,860
what's your favorite memory from our

9
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:17,170
childhood I think probably there's those

10
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,490
moments where Eliza where you know how

11
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,619
we're always like this in separate rooms

12
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,180
and we realize gonna need to like spend

13
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,500
time together all the time so we just

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,810
watched movies i watch youtube videos

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,119
for a long time all night and does binge

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,200
watch them I think probably my favorite

17
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:42,610
part of everything

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:47,340
what's gets to help me sees once we're

19
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:51,899
never seeming sad probably come to you I

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,240
understand you more yeah I also like how

21
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,740
just how I guess conscious you are not

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,649
like evidence not to you about the world

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,690
and like all the injustice is going on

24
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:04,299
because even though we have I eat

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,929
rabbits and snow this like I'm talking

26
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,929
to someone my age

27
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:30,970
what's the most annoying thing about me

28
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:33,670
I guess when we really something that we

29
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,359
don't that we have different venues on

30
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,239
and you're persistent like today you

31
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:42,040
take me somewhere it makes to a store

32
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,269
but if I'm gonna have to go somewhere

33
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:51,190
with your friends and I out complain but

34
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:56,430
you know I think order it's like own

35
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,430
when you know that back down

36
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:19,970
yeah when you I grant on about comic

37
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:26,390
books and stuff I don't want to hear

38
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:28,280
about when you called me and I'm late

39
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,810
granting to you about what's going on in

40
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,940
my life this way I'll be fine like

41
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,470
doodoo and get yourself together and I'm

42
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,900
like it's not that simple like that's

43
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,330
what I complained but you know what that

44
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,620
there's things problems that you have

45
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:45,830
diet you know that can be easier yeah

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:50,420
like not knowing but just the fact that

47
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:52,700
you do like think like like older it's

48
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,130
easy everyone like it's not like average

49
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,019
this time you got now unlike it gets so

50
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,220
much hard really frustrating that you

51
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,420
don't get that from like I know you're

52
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,730
gonna get to my age of you like I should

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,730
it looks I know I I do think it's gonna

54
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:09,590
get harder anything like problems by

55
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:17,299
going to school maybe that that partisan

56
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:19,100
right they got it but sometimes I don't

57
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:22,520
understand that the way that you

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,970
describe your problems okay pull it up

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,970
for a sec guys

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:41,620
when do you feel closest to me banana

61
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,630
this way we talk about serious issues

62
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,980
especially if Evan something like I'm so

63
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,840
passionate about and I will have a lot

64
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,880
of people here talks about it so when

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,650
we're talking about like creation of

66
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,450
justice is old we're talking about the

67
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,420
stronger tomorrow how we can fix it an

68
00:04:52,450 --> 00:05:24,010
education system that makes us spending

69
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:26,160
closer also bonding over yes that's what

70
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,160
I do

71
00:05:30,850 --> 00:06:05,350
what do you think is mom's favorite and

72
00:05:33,370 --> 00:06:16,980
that's why I think I'm here for him to

73
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:22,450
talk to you for me to talk to is easy to

74
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:25,510
doctor I think oh no I say mommy likes

75
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:29,200
to alarm her angrily in different

76
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:32,320
aspects so like she may like me more

77
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,090
time to talk about things that we

78
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,850
understand each other well I see your

79
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,010
sign because when you're around her more

80
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:46,120
analogous I think it's a for all the

81
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:49,870
signs but it's something that feels I

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,410
don't see a few more why because you

83
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,180
guys

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,540
well I speeding thank you guys I want to

85
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,380
talk about where does he eat here to you

86
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,380
yeah okay also

87
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:13,080
haha I changed since we met and how do

88
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,080
you are how did your arms refill on it

89
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,639
okay it seemed like so much when you

90
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,229
were small you know obviously like

91
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,949
everyone said link-ups

92
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:26,740
I was only child and so like I first I

93
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:30,039
don't like you but then you feel like

94
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,650
the first I guess with eight years of

95
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,530
your life we're very close and you did

96
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,970
everything I said great together was

97
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:42,729
awesome and we couldn't leave each other

98
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:45,130
side and how about teens Kentucky met

99
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:49,509
and hope you don't see nobody I think

100
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:52,090
before you are attaching your this

101
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:54,069
wanting to be around more and I mean it

102
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,690
makes sense I was at York now so you're

103
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,460
not going to be so touched

104
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,330
but now feel like you're good-looking as

105
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:05,020
a young and me are around as much as you

106
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,520
did or look you call just the only thing

107
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,310
going to see you feel like you don't

108
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,659
miss me but I'm just feeling down you

109
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,830
feel like it's like your duty to me to

110
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:19,800
be around me to make me happy or

111
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,800
satisfied and Toto feel about it

112
00:08:44,860 --> 00:09:30,529
you change most of the time so I think

113
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:33,949
that's mostly where I don't think you

114
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:39,470
have really high schemes I talked to you

115
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:43,069
before love you and I think I sounded

116
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,410
like I was in a mini-mart it's how we

117
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:47,779
have more similarities and that was

118
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:59,620
being able to talk to you but I didn't

119
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:59,620
know that we have so much and

120
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:09,230
like blessed bickering this X can you

121
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,230
yeah

122
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:18,830
what's one thing I can improve to I

123
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,830
could do to improve our relationship

124
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,650
I mean he asked her about what's going

125
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,030
on in school but I talked to you about

126
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,030
like subjects but I don't have to give

127
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:39,300
up problems or homework or people at

128
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:41,310
school but that axial song yeah well but

129
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:47,040
you started sick totally you think it

130
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:49,100
was a good day so yummy asking more

131
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,100
about

132
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,910
yeah

133
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:04,819
oh wait I don't need it again yeah

134
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,379
what's one thing that I can do it's a

135
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:13,459
foot of our relationship do you have

136
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:16,910
anything I can do to it food I mean I

137
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:18,740
won't please you say oh I feel like I'm

138
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,120
telling you to do something you don't

139
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:25,220
want to do that you would have done it

140
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,749
already but uh I guess just like what

141
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,279
you just don't we're all just like

142
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:32,749
hanging around just like hanging out

143
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,710
just like spent much time with each

144
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:38,769
other especially for most of the time so

145
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,769
[Music]

146
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:49,160
what one piece of advice Oh what one

147
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,149
piece of advice would you give here

148
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,149
Totoro stuff

149
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,770
[Music]

150
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:17,429
I mean now it's like a good kid IAT like

151
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:24,980
everything was good but I would say

152
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:28,829
maybe just like worn myself that

153
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,499
Gothenburg holidays no just

154
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,509
I think treasuring like when I tell you

155
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:35,220
this judging at time that attitude new

156
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,749
school is the best time of my life and I

157
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:43,019
know everybody at college from things

158
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:44,480
that middle school is like the worst it

159
00:12:43,019 --> 00:13:10,669
was amazing

160
00:12:44,480 --> 00:13:13,410
I wish I said you're in college still

161
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:14,790
using the only talking phone and I

162
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,790
always have work to do

163
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:28,410
and even on a weekends I'm always doing

164
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:35,369
something well no it's not a fight over

165
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:39,079
these I I just I don't know I guess I

166
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:39,079
just have to urge you do it so I

167
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:49,550
about talking to anyone phone yeah

168
00:13:46,940 --> 00:14:00,470
because especially when I'm alone

169
00:13:49,550 --> 00:14:03,230
because I didn't be sort of doing so he

170
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:07,040
it does not easily since I'm not doing

171
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,960
comic comic books or watching videos I

172
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,520
think since I got you set out that's why

173
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,750
when you come back I don't use with a

174
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,960
talk at much I also think well as far as

175
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,210
not talking away from each other I think

176
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,980
just about edges are so differently by

177
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,810
the time how we go hearing in the school

178
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,140
you get out of grave and I have meetings

179
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,030
at school and then like I think that's a

180
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,700
part of it so most I think sometimes

181
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,510
when you do talk like I think we just

182
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,510
want someone to talk to

183
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,870
accommodation is short and sweet yeah

184
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,270
talk to you a lot okay

185
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:49,000
make some time a little bit by myself

186
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:49,000
yeah or I have important to Kiki

187
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:56,270
yep yeah because there's someone that

188
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,830
talk to you I don't I don't talk to my

189
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:09,500
friends like that they just call them

190
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:14,660
anytime call it random moment ecologies

191
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:22,070
indeed when I read doesn't need someone

192
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:28,570
else to be present however Karen's

193
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:28,570
affected who we are question

194
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,060
well mommy I think I don't know like

195
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,610
what you know compared to what I know I

196
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,790
mean it's not us but I just think like

197
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:45,930
the way she grew up is completely

198
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:49,430
completely different from ours and she

199
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:53,210
like try so hard and not like that

200
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:57,000
part of her life affect that like now

201
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,860
and I think and even the less it gates

202
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,140
and like she tries to block out some

203
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,630
people where that's the negative energy

204
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,279
for our household she still tries to

205
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,330
help them so she's like even though

206
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,980
she's trying to make this like better

207
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,900
life for us she's still like right now

208
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,220
like I love you and I still need to

209
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,020
support this person even though they

210
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,450
probably aren't a good person

211
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,779
so I think her strength and like her

212
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:22,560
will to make us better people just have

213
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,660
our lives may be incredible is something

214
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,470
I think that we took on and they do it

215
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,470
affects us immensely

216
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:40,440
our parents but did you hear I think

217
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:45,480
with daddy Jets well with one with him

218
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,630
Club it away and then also there's

219
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,510
everything that went on I I think

220
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:55,260
affected me a lot in terms of my trust

221
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:59,160
issues and just getting to know people

222
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:02,400
is like artists 33 thousand times higher

223
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,240
than he used to be so I think that's

224
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,240
about the Nemo's

225
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:16,169
well daddy you million honored to I so

226
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:19,049
new I um since money let's keep with us

227
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:21,779
it's easier for me to talk to early but

228
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:24,569
I still feel like that tense he's been

229
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:30,330
cutting over more for applications Oh

230
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:34,889
during Kristen I know he did a positive

231
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:39,840
role model like always I've known him so

232
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:41,549
I'm really okay it says he that come

233
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,350
he's always giving telling us what to do

234
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:47,039
but it came it seemed straight sometimes

235
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,690
but he just wants us to that he says

236
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,690
helping us to be better people

237
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:57,899
mommy and Mike I'll see about what you

238
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,440
said like mother and she said there'll

239
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:01,830
be out today

240
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:06,240
yeah because with us helping them even

241
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,700
in his family that even if they persist

242
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,179
for how to help them team up see another

243
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,039
nothing you sir but yeah I just like

244
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:18,559
that about her even if she argues that

245
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:23,159
we see this works me to be better to you

246
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,320
that's so that's why I think they didn't

247
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,860
mean this I try to make me a better

248
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,260
person I also think that you would just

249
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,260
be an open emotion

250
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,540
fucking love boxes they obviously like

251
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,030
well you say loving mommy but I don't

252
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:44,220
it's like looking unspoken thing with us

253
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:46,800
I think I appreciated of him always like

254
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:51,090
making sure that we know that He loves

255
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,470
us and I think that I'm just trying to

256
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,060
like I gotta spending like that and

257
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,900
everything I do in life you know like I

258
00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:00,240
love you I don't know even even though

259
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:08,310
you know they would ask me here and

260
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:10,410
tries to us you know if you could change

261
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:23,190
one thing about our childhood want me to

262
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:26,430
be me I talk to you more the ones that

263
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:29,550
sounded Nicky now it could be 91 fix

264
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:32,160
your something that were early on when

265
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:36,810
you would another maybe I talk to you

266
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,210
but I think whenever you're over really

267
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:42,810
animated talking down once I was dead

268
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,400
was even hit though and now that your

269
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:49,370
college that I was started to talk to

270
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,370
you more I think

271
00:19:51,340 --> 00:20:00,269
I think I would want to know geranium

272
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:03,009
Christian and my siblings earlier on oh

273
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:04,659
they're going maybe when you were born

274
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,190
and getting to know them around the same

275
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,789
time they could have brought us all

276
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,590
closer together there they go to speak

277
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:13,299
we like watching movies with these big

278
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,039
families and they're like I don't want a

279
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:20,559
big family but I think because I met

280
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:25,179
them when I was over there like where we

281
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:27,100
have a big candy but just email me busy

282
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,950
each other sometimes we don't visit them

283
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:36,669
all at once oh that's so maybe someone

284
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:47,110
yeah how do you think this creates

285
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:48,639
conflict in our relationship Wow okay so

286
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:56,080
when you were younger either obviously

287
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:57,610
really into sides if I go in I think

288
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,539
creates conflict is like we're all like

289
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:03,669
monkeys I don't know she believes in

290
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:07,480
every night I get that except like Jonas

291
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:11,110
I don't think it's comput well I mean I

292
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,519
don't know because I'm still all over

293
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,799
the place like I don't really know what

294
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:17,470
I think of this until you give me

295
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:22,210
evidence of the second you know so but I

296
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:24,610
think in terms of different things I say

297
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:30,309
what you might say like oh god you don't

298
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:31,720
believe it guys but anything I don't

299
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:35,999
know case conflict I think we definitely

300
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:39,429
have different perspectives on it and

301
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:42,190
when it comes out it's just I don't know

302
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,590
I just think it encourage conversation

303
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,870
and just a conversation

304
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:52,130
bicker about anything well when you said

305
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:55,880
that when I was W nate'd years ago well

306
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:59,270
yeah well yeah because well when I was

307
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,990
like a little kid I think that was about

308
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:04,670
God in the Michael in third about there

309
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,970
were critics are thinking about it I

310
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:11,570
don't think about that to us now I mean

311
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,850
even got but I don't really I don't know

312
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,800
but it's whisper these were listened to

313
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,470
relieved because there are many

314
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,110
practices of parts of different

315
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,240
religions type I once you but that

316
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,160
wasn't obvious practice but there there

317
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,000
are parts that I don't believe anymore

318
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,720
don't know how do you can't lose you oh

319
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,630
my god

320
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,100
oh that's terribly studies and school I

321
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:38,360
just don't like the fact that you your

322
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,510
phone you have to pick one he's just

323
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,270
like I don't like don't feel it's

324
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,130
necessary you just like well you know

325
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,410
you go to label yourself or something

326
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,700
you can believe in I'm in that be the

327
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,350
extent of it and just believe what you

328
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,210
believe you don't have to like identify

329
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,410
yourself or something and like proper

330
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,120
things for Christ there you and it just

331
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,710
like you believe what you want and keep

332
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,320
it simple even up I don't think our

333
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,020
faith creates constant maybe two years

334
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,930
ago because nothing ever starts first

335
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,210
started getting into divine in it and we

336
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:12,550
got all avoid talked about how you

337
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,550
didn't leave you know it's not a thing

338
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:24,930
it was very easy to this they got I was

339
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,630
getting into it building so that's why

340
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,630
they got a very passionate about it yeah

341
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,430
what do you think you could learn it

342
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:39,030
from me

343
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:41,700
well you were very good in schools I've

344
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:44,640
always tried to be that's just that's

345
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:50,250
what I do even though I don't even think

346
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,080
sometimes I try to get a truck they make

347
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,200
sort of my dreams ice cutting swords I

348
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,670
think they're not going to be exact but

349
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,210
assessing since you skipped a grade

350
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:03,870
I can't see the coming now but I just

351
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:06,120
wanna have a good life and I know you're

352
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,910
I've never they've seen your work or

353
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,450
your grades but they just don't you need

354
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:15,540
to describe it and hearing about a

355
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:18,740
necessity because of hearing about you

356
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:27,960
or a necessity because you know the

357
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:32,430
titles or the words that you've got also

358
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,940
it's just being a good person or are you

359
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:39,110
open to what YouTube I would have been

360
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,160
just in that

361
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:49,040
how they open the different kinds of

362
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:51,840
people I think what I learned from you

363
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:55,770
do a lot of things I mean why I think

364
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,340
your perfectionism and not only school I

365
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,990
think of a lot of things that's

366
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,670
inspiring just like you're just old

367
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,560
you're going to get it done in nearly

368
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,910
I'm gonna get it done in this way I want

369
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,010
to help I'm gonna do it on my own

370
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,190
and though sometimes that's annoying

371
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:17,640
what I think that drive is really cool

372
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:20,640
and I think the other year openness as

373
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,240
well even was like everything that I'm

374
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,190
passionate about

375
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,800
just like veganism so even though like

376
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,120
you are you're like spoken so no you

377
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,380
just like yeah like I know they could

378
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,880
hurt something to try to cut this out

379
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm gonna try to do this nothing gave me

380
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,740
an open to my lifestyle it's really

381
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,310
hopeful and I like that about you in

382
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,860
that openness yeah I'm going back so

383
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:43,920
about the week and let us say think what

384
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,230
kinds of people that get having what

385
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,980
been even over whatever think you can

386
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,270
even get four minutes in you can have

387
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,490
any type of friends me any breeze

388
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:59,070
anything like that yeah there's no

389
00:25:53,490 --> 00:26:01,020
reason to discriminate what's one less

390
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:10,580
annoyed day you would want me to never

391
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:14,670
forget lesson idea yeah lesson is I

392
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,410
think you're better that you come from

393
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,600
so many people who love and care about

394
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,730
you and I think especially being in

395
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,820
school with this if something ever

396
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,710
happened like people in school and like

397
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,330
yeah like things just like absolutely

398
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,010
probably gotta prove yourself feeling

399
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,830
here's would be the side

400
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,530
percent around people and that was just

401
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,220
fine but antenna but like not to lose

402
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,660
yourself in that

403
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,220
just remember who you are and just keep

404
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,230
that mindset and like even if these

405
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,240
people are trying to do do something

406
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,370
like I have this people awake in the

407
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,900
background like that home that support

408
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,570
me for who I am not trying to be

409
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:54,230
something else

410
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:57,170
um of the school I think that I have

411
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,330
their little different in school because

412
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,520
most of the reason is because I want

413
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,340
this much of a fool and I do I hold

414
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,770
because I'm just trying to get good yeah

415
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:16,760
no I don't want me to do it for people

416
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:21,350
like burning stuff what's one lesson or

417
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:27,950
again you want me to never forget this

418
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:31,430
lesson is to be as open as you can and

419
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,770
want to be with the people who want to

420
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,770
help so like Winstead things are going

421
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,960
on in your life or you know I can't tell

422
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,090
you that sir listen I was like I wish it

423
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,770

424
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,420
you do is I'm just like please tell me

425
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:50,630
and that I also think that help us

426
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:54,040
because acceptance being open to I think

427
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:56,600
I don't you forget being open to war

428
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:01,040
being open to do more things that you

429
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,140
don't appreciate or they said with

430
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,970
painting or drawing you didn't make that

431
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,850
into you got born one day so

432
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,570
there are materials you know you like a

433
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:16,330
lot yeah like stuff like that stuff that

434
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,820
you don't stuff that you don't really

435
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:24,460
appreciate now might be open to doing

436
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:27,130
something not sure what's one lesson or

437
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:37,120
value of that except you that you now

438
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:38,980
know is false false are wrong like it's

439
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,980
something that you would need or that no

440
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,200
no this is something that I told you

441
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,490
that you thought this true or like

442
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,220
something I believed and realized it

443
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:50,339
worth it

444
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,339
[Music]

445
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:29,040
from that I find out a little bit true

446
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:32,550
they it could be that disagreements

447
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,800
about his career scientists think that's

448
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:37,710
me when I'm doing work sometimes you may

449
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,980
have the pin and it may not be true or

450
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:46,100
it may be the same for me too I don't

451
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,100
have anything bigger big drastic yes

452
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:55,710
in what ways are we cylinder and how

453
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:58,890
does that scare you I think we're

454
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,510
similar in that we're not very social

455
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,100
like we like being home a lot and

456
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:09,630
there's watching our videos and being an

457
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:12,920
outlet space I think we don't like

458
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:15,420
talking about person stresses or issues

459
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,590
at all just like it's really

460
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,480
uncomfortable

461
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:21,930
I also think we break down my thoughts a

462
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:26,850
lot mean you can't get it up we have a

463
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:28,530
common common law and I think with our

464
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,590
you mentioned two expressing ourselves

465
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,580
there are and what scares me about the

466
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,370
socialization

467
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,659
shucks I mean I without an excellent

468
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,399
that bullying wasn't really a thing and

469
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:45,929
ice in my school tomorrow should go

470
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:47,580
today but I worry that your lack of

471
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,580
socialization is kind of expected

472
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,799
somehow and lack of talking yeah just

473
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,070
like when to talk to people are running

474
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,929
to being around friends and just kind of

475
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:02,640
I mean we like me and all tobacco that's

476
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:06,000
gonna affect you in high school some way

477
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,730
and a long do anything I don't go too

478
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,880
close that isn't telling people that I

479
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:16,019
go to school and I think you guys after

480
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,299
middle school it's hard to keep me in

481
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,159
touch with them I see once I don't that

482
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,990
question yeah so you've got a business

483
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,470
point and well we may be caused a high

484
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:29,940
school but I'm cutting I mean it still a

485
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:32,039
little we're about to go places so I

486
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,730
feel it should be easier with friends I

487
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:40,670
don't think it's worth those friendships

488
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:43,930
my students that happen that a lot of

489
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:47,030
things in life but when you're in that

490
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:50,480
time period like making it the best you

491
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,590
can be with those people even if you

492
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
don't be friends with them if you're not

493
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,100
president after is making those memories

494
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,730
those people who ever leave you should

495
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:02,690
do I feel like ice weird how yes

496
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:06,170
seminarian felt public rates or people

497
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,360
okay work you know how I didn't really

498
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,300
talk about it

499
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,230
hard elbow rates for people in the world

500
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:18,020
and you didn't talked about it with me

501
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:41,500
so this until Italy issues come up on a

502
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:44,360
news you talk about it because I guess I

503
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,310
just well you know how I'm sometimes

504
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:51,740
call you that damn they got have it off

505
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:54,380
did you know oh I'm afraid I'm kind of

506
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,550
afraid I because there's a lot of stuff

507
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,330
that you have to do when you're an adult

508
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,740
I I don't know

509
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:02,830
well I heard about if I don't know all

510
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:07,929
the specific details and I always ask

511
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:10,090
mommy about it says that there I know

512
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:14,950
how Texans work and everything but

513
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:17,440
that's giving insurance on everything

514
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:22,380
with it it's just hard so you sort of

515
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,380
maybe like scared and mister for me

516
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:30,450
because I feel like I said I would want

517
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,450
to know now yeah we're especially yeah

518
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:48,820
I'm afraid of getting over because I'll

519
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:51,279
play also I think I don't want to learn

520
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:54,309
the mean so pretty no very much so

521
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,480
scared for me because like we had a lot

522
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,190
of their parents and they know about

523
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,350
parents and as I said Griffin passed

524
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,210
away like I was parents are the next and

525
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:05,500
that scares me so if I'm gonna go there

526
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:08,379
they're gonna go that scary and I also

527
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,899
just think the unknown of the future is

528
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:13,450
like prom responsibilities and how many

529
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:15,460
like I just don't want any of it so I

530
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,320
think that's just I mean I want to get

531
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,260
all that expands like more paper travel

532
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,780
and go out but as far as like

533
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,690
responsibilities its accident working I

534
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,480
don't know

535
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:31,419
but the great thing about visual and

536
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,899
conference I'm scared about that too you

537
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:37,260
know it's their order they move around

538
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:37,260
that much

539
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,580
yeah I think about that all the time

540
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:45,909
especially in collagen so I would have

541
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,010
something happen to them I was away okay

542
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:50,169
so like that scares me all the time

543
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,119
because you never know why I was always

544

only this close Stephan offense I mean

598
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,920
it's just so hard on City I really

599
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:21,340
together and I thought we because there

600
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:29,990
but also I think that we know then since

601
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:33,080
here in colonies and then I'll make one

602
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:35,060
more order maybe they probably easy to

603
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:41,510
make when you're at college me beat the

604
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:44,660
same order know what you're like the

605
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:49,420
reason tip now maybe a same because you

606
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,420
either than somewhere else the same

607
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,360
yeah it can do stowaway they visit you

608
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:00,590
got any time whereas in college you

609
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:04,300

610
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:07,310
about something we don't need we'll see

611
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,780

612
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:19,160
were in the house together

613
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:20,630
I think already closer because even

614
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,580
though we may not live together I feel

615
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,410
because we'll be kind of close to our

616
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,750
age and we hope that that will be a bit

617
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:31,930
soft even more like even more personal

618
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,930
