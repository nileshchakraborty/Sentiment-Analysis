0:00:00.000,0:00:03.829
seconds and then sharpies yes sir

0:00:17.430,0:00:20.550
[Music]

0:00:33.699,0:00:40.239
what do you want to be when you grow up

0:00:37.500,0:00:52.629
well since I'm gonna go sign to me be an

0:00:40.239,0:00:56.559
engineer but I also like art and journey

0:00:52.629,0:00:59.820
there in adult dances though if you

0:00:56.559,0:00:59.820
don't tell me

0:01:02.289,0:01:14.860
what's your favorite memory from our

0:01:04.239,0:01:17.170
childhood I think probably there's those

0:01:14.860,0:01:18.490
moments where Eliza where you know how

0:01:17.170,0:01:20.619
we're always like this in separate rooms

0:01:18.490,0:01:22.180
and we realize gonna need to like spend

0:01:20.619,0:01:23.500
time together all the time so we just

0:01:22.180,0:01:25.810
watched movies i watch youtube videos

0:01:23.500,0:01:28.119
for a long time all night and does binge

0:01:25.810,0:01:29.200
watch them I think probably my favorite

0:01:28.119,0:01:42.610
part of everything

0:01:29.200,0:01:47.340
what's gets to help me sees once we're

0:01:42.610,0:01:51.899
never seeming sad probably come to you I

0:01:47.340,0:01:55.240
understand you more yeah I also like how

0:01:51.899,0:01:56.740
just how I guess conscious you are not

0:01:55.240,0:01:59.649
like evidence not to you about the world

0:01:56.740,0:02:01.690
and like all the injustice is going on

0:01:59.649,0:02:04.299
because even though we have I eat

0:02:01.690,0:02:06.929
rabbits and snow this like I'm talking

0:02:04.299,0:02:06.929
to someone my age

0:02:10.959,0:02:30.970
what's the most annoying thing about me

0:02:13.269,0:02:33.670
I guess when we really something that we

0:02:30.970,0:02:37.359
don't that we have different venues on

0:02:33.670,0:02:40.239
and you're persistent like today you

0:02:37.359,0:02:42.040
take me somewhere it makes to a store

0:02:40.239,0:02:46.269
but if I'm gonna have to go somewhere

0:02:42.040,0:02:51.190
with your friends and I out complain but

0:02:46.269,0:02:56.430
you know I think order it's like own

0:02:51.190,0:02:56.430
when you know that back down

0:03:01.700,0:03:19.970
yeah when you I grant on about comic

0:03:18.230,0:03:26.390
books and stuff I don't want to hear

0:03:19.970,0:03:28.280
about when you called me and I'm late

0:03:26.390,0:03:29.810
granting to you about what's going on in

0:03:28.280,0:03:31.940
my life this way I'll be fine like

0:03:29.810,0:03:33.470
doodoo and get yourself together and I'm

0:03:31.940,0:03:35.900
like it's not that simple like that's

0:03:33.470,0:03:38.330
what I complained but you know what that

0:03:35.900,0:03:41.620
there's things problems that you have

0:03:38.330,0:03:45.830
diet you know that can be easier yeah

0:03:41.620,0:03:50.420
like not knowing but just the fact that

0:03:45.830,0:03:52.700
you do like think like like older it's

0:03:50.420,0:03:55.130
easy everyone like it's not like average

0:03:52.700,0:03:57.019
this time you got now unlike it gets so

0:03:55.130,0:03:58.220
much hard really frustrating that you

0:03:57.019,0:03:59.420
don't get that from like I know you're

0:03:58.220,0:04:01.730
gonna get to my age of you like I should

0:03:59.420,0:04:04.730
it looks I know I I do think it's gonna

0:04:01.730,0:04:09.590
get harder anything like problems by

0:04:04.730,0:04:17.299
going to school maybe that that partisan

0:04:09.590,0:04:19.100
right they got it but sometimes I don't

0:04:17.299,0:04:22.520
understand that the way that you

0:04:19.100,0:04:24.970
describe your problems okay pull it up

0:04:22.520,0:04:24.970
for a sec guys

0:04:32.190,0:04:41.620
when do you feel closest to me banana

0:04:38.950,0:04:43.630
this way we talk about serious issues

0:04:41.620,0:04:44.980
especially if Evan something like I'm so

0:04:43.630,0:04:46.840
passionate about and I will have a lot

0:04:44.980,0:04:48.880
of people here talks about it so when

0:04:46.840,0:04:50.650
we're talking about like creation of

0:04:48.880,0:04:52.450
justice is old we're talking about the

0:04:50.650,0:04:54.420
stronger tomorrow how we can fix it an

0:04:52.450,0:05:24.010
education system that makes us spending

0:04:54.420,0:05:26.160
closer also bonding over yes that's what

0:05:24.010,0:05:26.160
I do

0:05:30.850,0:06:05.350
what do you think is mom's favorite and

0:05:33.370,0:06:16.980
that's why I think I'm here for him to

0:06:05.350,0:06:22.450
talk to you for me to talk to is easy to

0:06:16.980,0:06:25.510
doctor I think oh no I say mommy likes

0:06:22.450,0:06:29.200
to alarm her angrily in different

0:06:25.510,0:06:32.320
aspects so like she may like me more

0:06:29.200,0:06:34.090
time to talk about things that we

0:06:32.320,0:06:36.850
understand each other well I see your

0:06:34.090,0:06:39.010
sign because when you're around her more

0:06:36.850,0:06:46.120
analogous I think it's a for all the

0:06:39.010,0:06:49.870
signs but it's something that feels I

0:06:46.120,0:06:50.410
don't see a few more why because you

0:06:49.870,0:06:52.180
guys

0:06:50.410,0:06:54.540
well I speeding thank you guys I want to

0:06:52.180,0:06:58.380
talk about where does he eat here to you

0:06:54.540,0:06:58.380
yeah okay also

0:07:04.319,0:07:13.080
haha I changed since we met and how do

0:07:08.710,0:07:13.080
you are how did your arms refill on it

0:07:14.400,0:07:18.639
okay it seemed like so much when you

0:07:17.319,0:07:20.229
were small you know obviously like

0:07:18.639,0:07:23.949
everyone said link-ups

0:07:20.229,0:07:26.740
I was only child and so like I first I

0:07:23.949,0:07:30.039
don't like you but then you feel like

0:07:26.740,0:07:32.650
the first I guess with eight years of

0:07:30.039,0:07:35.530
your life we're very close and you did

0:07:32.650,0:07:36.970
everything I said great together was

0:07:35.530,0:07:42.729
awesome and we couldn't leave each other

0:07:36.970,0:07:45.130
side and how about teens Kentucky met

0:07:42.729,0:07:49.509
and hope you don't see nobody I think

0:07:45.130,0:07:52.090
before you are attaching your this

0:07:49.509,0:07:54.069
wanting to be around more and I mean it

0:07:52.090,0:07:55.690
makes sense I was at York now so you're

0:07:54.069,0:07:57.460
not going to be so touched

0:07:55.690,0:08:01.330
but now feel like you're good-looking as

0:07:57.460,0:08:05.020
a young and me are around as much as you

0:08:01.330,0:08:06.520
did or look you call just the only thing

0:08:05.020,0:08:09.310
going to see you feel like you don't

0:08:06.520,0:08:13.659
miss me but I'm just feeling down you

0:08:09.310,0:08:14.830
feel like it's like your duty to me to

0:08:13.659,0:08:19.800
be around me to make me happy or

0:08:14.830,0:08:19.800
satisfied and Toto feel about it

0:08:44.860,0:09:30.529
you change most of the time so I think

0:09:17.540,0:09:33.949
that's mostly where I don't think you

0:09:30.529,0:09:39.470
have really high schemes I talked to you

0:09:33.949,0:09:43.069
before love you and I think I sounded

0:09:39.470,0:09:45.410
like I was in a mini-mart it's how we

0:09:43.069,0:09:47.779
have more similarities and that was

0:09:45.410,0:09:59.620
being able to talk to you but I didn't

0:09:47.779,0:09:59.620
know that we have so much and

0:10:02.910,0:10:09.230
like blessed bickering this X can you

0:10:06.510,0:10:09.230
yeah

0:10:11.810,0:10:18.830
what's one thing I can improve to I

0:10:15.390,0:10:18.830
could do to improve our relationship

0:10:23.160,0:10:28.650
I mean he asked her about what's going

0:10:26.310,0:10:30.030
on in school but I talked to you about

0:10:28.650,0:10:33.030
like subjects but I don't have to give

0:10:30.030,0:10:39.300
up problems or homework or people at

0:10:33.030,0:10:41.310
school but that axial song yeah well but

0:10:39.300,0:10:47.040
you started sick totally you think it

0:10:41.310,0:10:49.100
was a good day so yummy asking more

0:10:47.040,0:10:49.100
about

0:10:53.910,0:10:56.910
yeah

0:10:57.529,0:11:04.819
oh wait I don't need it again yeah

0:11:03.170,0:11:06.379
what's one thing that I can do it's a

0:11:04.819,0:11:13.459
foot of our relationship do you have

0:11:06.379,0:11:16.910
anything I can do to it food I mean I

0:11:13.459,0:11:18.740
won't please you say oh I feel like I'm

0:11:16.910,0:11:20.120
telling you to do something you don't

0:11:18.740,0:11:25.220
want to do that you would have done it

0:11:20.120,0:11:26.749
already but uh I guess just like what

0:11:25.220,0:11:30.279
you just don't we're all just like

0:11:26.749,0:11:32.749
hanging around just like hanging out

0:11:30.279,0:11:35.710
just like spent much time with each

0:11:32.749,0:11:38.769
other especially for most of the time so

0:11:35.710,0:11:38.769
[Music]

0:11:42.430,0:11:49.160
what one piece of advice Oh what one

0:11:47.540,0:11:52.149
piece of advice would you give here

0:11:49.160,0:11:52.149
Totoro stuff

0:11:55.280,0:12:02.770
[Music]

0:12:06.360,0:12:17.429
I mean now it's like a good kid IAT like

0:12:15.059,0:12:24.980
everything was good but I would say

0:12:17.429,0:12:28.829
maybe just like worn myself that

0:12:24.980,0:12:31.499
Gothenburg holidays no just

0:12:28.829,0:12:33.509
I think treasuring like when I tell you

0:12:31.499,0:12:35.220
this judging at time that attitude new

0:12:33.509,0:12:36.749
school is the best time of my life and I

0:12:35.220,0:12:43.019
know everybody at college from things

0:12:36.749,0:12:44.480
that middle school is like the worst it

0:12:43.019,0:13:10.669
was amazing

0:12:44.480,0:13:13.410
I wish I said you're in college still

0:13:10.669,0:13:14.790
using the only talking phone and I

0:13:13.410,0:13:17.790
always have work to do

0:13:14.790,0:13:28.410
and even on a weekends I'm always doing

0:13:17.790,0:13:35.369
something well no it's not a fight over

0:13:28.410,0:13:39.079
these I I just I don't know I guess I

0:13:35.369,0:13:39.079
just have to urge you do it so I

0:13:39.340,0:13:49.550
about talking to anyone phone yeah

0:13:46.940,0:14:00.470
because especially when I'm alone

0:13:49.550,0:14:03.230
because I didn't be sort of doing so he

0:14:00.470,0:14:07.040
it does not easily since I'm not doing

0:14:03.230,0:14:08.960
comic comic books or watching videos I

0:14:07.040,0:14:10.520
think since I got you set out that's why

0:14:08.960,0:14:14.750
when you come back I don't use with a

0:14:10.520,0:14:16.960
talk at much I also think well as far as

0:14:14.750,0:14:20.210
not talking away from each other I think

0:14:16.960,0:14:21.980
just about edges are so differently by

0:14:20.210,0:14:23.810
the time how we go hearing in the school

0:14:21.980,0:14:27.140
you get out of grave and I have meetings

0:14:23.810,0:14:29.030
at school and then like I think that's a

0:14:27.140,0:14:31.700
part of it so most I think sometimes

0:14:29.030,0:14:34.510
when you do talk like I think we just

0:14:31.700,0:14:34.510
want someone to talk to

0:14:36.670,0:14:41.870
accommodation is short and sweet yeah

0:14:40.400,0:14:44.270
talk to you a lot okay

0:14:41.870,0:14:49.000
make some time a little bit by myself

0:14:44.270,0:14:49.000
yeah or I have important to Kiki

0:14:49.420,0:14:56.270
yep yeah because there's someone that

0:14:52.610,0:14:57.830
talk to you I don't I don't talk to my

0:14:56.270,0:15:09.500
friends like that they just call them

0:14:57.830,0:15:14.660
anytime call it random moment ecologies

0:15:09.500,0:15:22.070
indeed when I read doesn't need someone

0:15:14.660,0:15:28.570
else to be present however Karen's

0:15:22.070,0:15:28.570
affected who we are question

0:15:29.839,0:15:36.060
well mommy I think I don't know like

0:15:34.110,0:15:38.610
what you know compared to what I know I

0:15:36.060,0:15:41.790
mean it's not us but I just think like

0:15:38.610,0:15:45.930
the way she grew up is completely

0:15:41.790,0:15:49.430
completely different from ours and she

0:15:45.930,0:15:53.210
like try so hard and not like that

0:15:49.430,0:15:57.000
part of her life affect that like now

0:15:53.210,0:15:58.860
and I think and even the less it gates

0:15:57.000,0:16:01.140
and like she tries to block out some

0:15:58.860,0:16:03.630
people where that's the negative energy

0:16:01.140,0:16:05.279
for our household she still tries to

0:16:03.630,0:16:06.330
help them so she's like even though

0:16:05.279,0:16:07.980
she's trying to make this like better

0:16:06.330,0:16:09.900
life for us she's still like right now

0:16:07.980,0:16:11.220
like I love you and I still need to

0:16:09.900,0:16:13.020
support this person even though they

0:16:11.220,0:16:15.450
probably aren't a good person

0:16:13.020,0:16:18.779
so I think her strength and like her

0:16:15.450,0:16:22.560
will to make us better people just have

0:16:18.779,0:16:24.660
our lives may be incredible is something

0:16:22.560,0:16:27.470
I think that we took on and they do it

0:16:24.660,0:16:27.470
affects us immensely

0:16:30.350,0:16:40.440
our parents but did you hear I think

0:16:34.640,0:16:45.480
with daddy Jets well with one with him

0:16:40.440,0:16:48.630
Club it away and then also there's

0:16:45.480,0:16:51.510
everything that went on I I think

0:16:48.630,0:16:55.260
affected me a lot in terms of my trust

0:16:51.510,0:16:59.160
issues and just getting to know people

0:16:55.260,0:17:02.400
is like artists 33 thousand times higher

0:16:59.160,0:17:05.240
than he used to be so I think that's

0:17:02.400,0:17:05.240
about the Nemo's

0:17:06.409,0:17:16.169
well daddy you million honored to I so

0:17:12.659,0:17:19.049
new I um since money let's keep with us

0:17:16.169,0:17:21.779
it's easier for me to talk to early but

0:17:19.049,0:17:24.569
I still feel like that tense he's been

0:17:21.779,0:17:30.330
cutting over more for applications Oh

0:17:24.569,0:17:34.889
during Kristen I know he did a positive

0:17:30.330,0:17:39.840
role model like always I've known him so

0:17:34.889,0:17:41.549
I'm really okay it says he that come

0:17:39.840,0:17:43.350
he's always giving telling us what to do

0:17:41.549,0:17:47.039
but it came it seemed straight sometimes

0:17:43.350,0:17:48.690
but he just wants us to that he says

0:17:47.039,0:17:51.690
helping us to be better people

0:17:48.690,0:17:57.899
mommy and Mike I'll see about what you

0:17:51.690,0:17:58.440
said like mother and she said there'll

0:17:57.899,0:18:01.830
be out today

0:17:58.440,0:18:06.240
yeah because with us helping them even

0:18:01.830,0:18:08.700
in his family that even if they persist

0:18:06.240,0:18:11.179
for how to help them team up see another

0:18:08.700,0:18:14.039
nothing you sir but yeah I just like

0:18:11.179,0:18:18.559
that about her even if she argues that

0:18:14.039,0:18:23.159
we see this works me to be better to you

0:18:18.559,0:18:25.320
that's so that's why I think they didn't

0:18:23.159,0:18:28.860
mean this I try to make me a better

0:18:25.320,0:18:31.260
person I also think that you would just

0:18:28.860,0:18:34.260
be an open emotion

0:18:31.260,0:18:36.540
fucking love boxes they obviously like

0:18:34.260,0:18:39.030
well you say loving mommy but I don't

0:18:36.540,0:18:44.220
it's like looking unspoken thing with us

0:18:39.030,0:18:46.800
I think I appreciated of him always like

0:18:44.220,0:18:51.090
making sure that we know that He loves

0:18:46.800,0:18:52.470
us and I think that I'm just trying to

0:18:51.090,0:18:54.060
like I gotta spending like that and

0:18:52.470,0:18:57.900
everything I do in life you know like I

0:18:54.060,0:19:00.240
love you I don't know even even though

0:18:57.900,0:19:08.310
you know they would ask me here and

0:19:00.240,0:19:10.410
tries to us you know if you could change

0:19:08.310,0:19:23.190
one thing about our childhood want me to

0:19:10.410,0:19:26.430
be me I talk to you more the ones that

0:19:23.190,0:19:29.550
sounded Nicky now it could be 91 fix

0:19:26.430,0:19:32.160
your something that were early on when

0:19:29.550,0:19:36.810
you would another maybe I talk to you

0:19:32.160,0:19:39.210
but I think whenever you're over really

0:19:36.810,0:19:42.810
animated talking down once I was dead

0:19:39.210,0:19:44.400
was even hit though and now that your

0:19:42.810,0:19:49.370
college that I was started to talk to

0:19:44.400,0:19:49.370
you more I think

0:19:51.340,0:20:00.269
I think I would want to know geranium

0:19:55.809,0:20:03.009
Christian and my siblings earlier on oh

0:20:00.269,0:20:04.659
they're going maybe when you were born

0:20:03.009,0:20:06.190
and getting to know them around the same

0:20:04.659,0:20:08.789
time they could have brought us all

0:20:06.190,0:20:11.590
closer together there they go to speak

0:20:08.789,0:20:13.299
we like watching movies with these big

0:20:11.590,0:20:15.039
families and they're like I don't want a

0:20:13.299,0:20:20.559
big family but I think because I met

0:20:15.039,0:20:25.179
them when I was over there like where we

0:20:20.559,0:20:27.100
have a big candy but just email me busy

0:20:25.179,0:20:29.950
each other sometimes we don't visit them

0:20:27.100,0:20:36.669
all at once oh that's so maybe someone

0:20:29.950,0:20:47.110
yeah how do you think this creates

0:20:36.669,0:20:48.639
conflict in our relationship Wow okay so

0:20:47.110,0:20:56.080
when you were younger either obviously

0:20:48.639,0:20:57.610
really into sides if I go in I think

0:20:56.080,0:21:00.539
creates conflict is like we're all like

0:20:57.610,0:21:03.669
monkeys I don't know she believes in

0:21:00.539,0:21:07.480
every night I get that except like Jonas

0:21:03.669,0:21:11.110
I don't think it's comput well I mean I

0:21:07.480,0:21:12.519
don't know because I'm still all over

0:21:11.110,0:21:14.799
the place like I don't really know what

0:21:12.519,0:21:17.470
I think of this until you give me

0:21:14.799,0:21:22.210
evidence of the second you know so but I

0:21:17.470,0:21:24.610
think in terms of different things I say

0:21:22.210,0:21:30.309
what you might say like oh god you don't

0:21:24.610,0:21:31.720
believe it guys but anything I don't

0:21:30.309,0:21:35.999
know case conflict I think we definitely

0:21:31.720,0:21:39.429
have different perspectives on it and

0:21:35.999,0:21:42.190
when it comes out it's just I don't know

0:21:39.429,0:21:44.590
I just think it encourage conversation

0:21:42.190,0:21:47.870
and just a conversation

0:21:44.590,0:21:52.130
bicker about anything well when you said

0:21:47.870,0:21:55.880
that when I was W nate'd years ago well

0:21:52.130,0:21:59.270
yeah well yeah because well when I was

0:21:55.880,0:22:02.990
like a little kid I think that was about

0:21:59.270,0:22:04.670
God in the Michael in third about there

0:22:02.990,0:22:07.970
were critics are thinking about it I

0:22:04.670,0:22:11.570
don't think about that to us now I mean

0:22:07.970,0:22:13.850
even got but I don't really I don't know

0:22:11.570,0:22:15.800
but it's whisper these were listened to

0:22:13.850,0:22:18.470
relieved because there are many

0:22:15.800,0:22:21.110
practices of parts of different

0:22:18.470,0:22:23.240
religions type I once you but that

0:22:21.110,0:22:25.160
wasn't obvious practice but there there

0:22:23.240,0:22:29.000
are parts that I don't believe anymore

0:22:25.160,0:22:29.720
don't know how do you can't lose you oh

0:22:29.000,0:22:32.630
my god

0:22:29.720,0:22:37.100
oh that's terribly studies and school I

0:22:32.630,0:22:38.360
just don't like the fact that you your

0:22:37.100,0:22:41.510
phone you have to pick one he's just

0:22:38.360,0:22:44.270
like I don't like don't feel it's

0:22:41.510,0:22:46.130
necessary you just like well you know

0:22:44.270,0:22:48.410
you go to label yourself or something

0:22:46.130,0:22:49.700
you can believe in I'm in that be the

0:22:48.410,0:22:51.350
extent of it and just believe what you

0:22:49.700,0:22:53.210
believe you don't have to like identify

0:22:51.350,0:22:54.410
yourself or something and like proper

0:22:53.210,0:22:56.120
things for Christ there you and it just

0:22:54.410,0:22:57.710
like you believe what you want and keep

0:22:56.120,0:23:00.320
it simple even up I don't think our

0:22:57.710,0:23:03.020
faith creates constant maybe two years

0:23:00.320,0:23:05.930
ago because nothing ever starts first

0:23:03.020,0:23:08.210
started getting into divine in it and we

0:23:05.930,0:23:12.550
got all avoid talked about how you

0:23:08.210,0:23:12.550
didn't leave you know it's not a thing

0:23:16.550,0:23:24.930
it was very easy to this they got I was

0:23:22.560,0:23:29.630
getting into it building so that's why

0:23:24.930,0:23:29.630
they got a very passionate about it yeah

0:23:31.280,0:23:34.430
what do you think you could learn it

0:23:33.270,0:23:39.030
from me

0:23:34.430,0:23:41.700
well you were very good in schools I've

0:23:39.030,0:23:44.640
always tried to be that's just that's

0:23:41.700,0:23:50.250
what I do even though I don't even think

0:23:44.640,0:23:52.080
sometimes I try to get a truck they make

0:23:50.250,0:23:54.200
sort of my dreams ice cutting swords I

0:23:52.080,0:23:56.670
think they're not going to be exact but

0:23:54.200,0:24:00.210
assessing since you skipped a grade

0:23:56.670,0:24:03.870
I can't see the coming now but I just

0:24:00.210,0:24:06.120
wanna have a good life and I know you're

0:24:03.870,0:24:08.910
I've never they've seen your work or

0:24:06.120,0:24:12.450
your grades but they just don't you need

0:24:08.910,0:24:15.540
to describe it and hearing about a

0:24:12.450,0:24:18.740
necessity because of hearing about you

0:24:15.540,0:24:27.960
or a necessity because you know the

0:24:18.740,0:24:32.430
titles or the words that you've got also

0:24:27.960,0:24:35.940
it's just being a good person or are you

0:24:32.430,0:24:39.110
open to what YouTube I would have been

0:24:35.940,0:24:41.160
just in that

0:24:39.110,0:24:49.040
how they open the different kinds of

0:24:41.160,0:24:51.840
people I think what I learned from you

0:24:49.040,0:24:55.770
do a lot of things I mean why I think

0:24:51.840,0:24:58.340
your perfectionism and not only school I

0:24:55.770,0:25:00.990
think of a lot of things that's

0:24:58.340,0:25:02.670
inspiring just like you're just old

0:25:00.990,0:25:04.560
you're going to get it done in nearly

0:25:02.670,0:25:05.910
I'm gonna get it done in this way I want

0:25:04.560,0:25:08.010
to help I'm gonna do it on my own

0:25:05.910,0:25:11.190
and though sometimes that's annoying

0:25:08.010,0:25:17.640
what I think that drive is really cool

0:25:11.190,0:25:20.640
and I think the other year openness as

0:25:17.640,0:25:21.240
well even was like everything that I'm

0:25:20.640,0:25:23.190
passionate about

0:25:21.240,0:25:25.800
just like veganism so even though like

0:25:23.190,0:25:27.120
you are you're like spoken so no you

0:25:25.800,0:25:28.380
just like yeah like I know they could

0:25:27.120,0:25:29.880
hurt something to try to cut this out

0:25:28.380,0:25:32.760
I'm gonna try to do this nothing gave me

0:25:29.880,0:25:34.740
an open to my lifestyle it's really

0:25:32.760,0:25:38.310
hopeful and I like that about you in

0:25:34.740,0:25:40.860
that openness yeah I'm going back so

0:25:38.310,0:25:43.920
about the week and let us say think what

0:25:40.860,0:25:46.230
kinds of people that get having what

0:25:43.920,0:25:49.980
been even over whatever think you can

0:25:46.230,0:25:51.270
even get four minutes in you can have

0:25:49.980,0:25:53.490
any type of friends me any breeze

0:25:51.270,0:25:59.070
anything like that yeah there's no

0:25:53.490,0:26:01.020
reason to discriminate what's one less

0:25:59.070,0:26:10.580
annoyed day you would want me to never

0:26:01.020,0:26:14.670
forget lesson idea yeah lesson is I

0:26:10.580,0:26:16.410
think you're better that you come from

0:26:14.670,0:26:18.600
so many people who love and care about

0:26:16.410,0:26:20.730
you and I think especially being in

0:26:18.600,0:26:23.820
school with this if something ever

0:26:20.730,0:26:25.710
happened like people in school and like

0:26:23.820,0:26:27.330
yeah like things just like absolutely

0:26:25.710,0:26:28.010
probably gotta prove yourself feeling

0:26:27.330,0:26:30.830
here's would be the side

0:26:28.010,0:26:33.530
percent around people and that was just

0:26:30.830,0:26:34.220
fine but antenna but like not to lose

0:26:33.530,0:26:38.660
yourself in that

0:26:34.220,0:26:40.220
just remember who you are and just keep

0:26:38.660,0:26:42.230
that mindset and like even if these

0:26:40.220,0:26:44.240
people are trying to do do something

0:26:42.230,0:26:46.370
like I have this people awake in the

0:26:44.240,0:26:47.900
background like that home that support

0:26:46.370,0:26:49.570
me for who I am not trying to be

0:26:47.900,0:26:54.230
something else

0:26:49.570,0:26:57.170
um of the school I think that I have

0:26:54.230,0:26:59.330
their little different in school because

0:26:57.170,0:27:01.520
most of the reason is because I want

0:26:59.330,0:27:03.340
this much of a fool and I do I hold

0:27:01.520,0:27:06.770
because I'm just trying to get good yeah

0:27:03.340,0:27:16.760
no I don't want me to do it for people

0:27:06.770,0:27:21.350
like burning stuff what's one lesson or

0:27:16.760,0:27:27.950
again you want me to never forget this

0:27:21.350,0:27:31.430
lesson is to be as open as you can and

0:27:27.950,0:27:33.770
want to be with the people who want to

0:27:31.430,0:27:36.770
help so like Winstead things are going

0:27:33.770,0:27:38.960
on in your life or you know I can't tell

0:27:36.770,0:27:41.090
you that sir listen I was like I wish it

0:27:38.960,0:27:42.770
hit like I'm never gonna tell you folks

0:27:41.090,0:27:44.420
you do is I'm just like please tell me

0:27:42.770,0:27:50.630
and that I also think that help us

0:27:44.420,0:27:54.040
because acceptance being open to I think

0:27:50.630,0:27:56.600
I don't you forget being open to war

0:27:54.040,0:28:01.040
being open to do more things that you

0:27:56.600,0:28:03.140
don't appreciate or they said with

0:28:01.040,0:28:06.970
painting or drawing you didn't make that

0:28:03.140,0:28:09.850
into you got born one day so

0:28:06.970,0:28:13.570
there are materials you know you like a

0:28:09.850,0:28:16.330
lot yeah like stuff like that stuff that

0:28:13.570,0:28:18.820
you don't stuff that you don't really

0:28:16.330,0:28:24.460
appreciate now might be open to doing

0:28:18.820,0:28:27.130
something not sure what's one lesson or

0:28:24.460,0:28:37.120
value of that except you that you now

0:28:27.130,0:28:38.980
know is false false are wrong like it's

0:28:37.120,0:28:41.980
something that you would need or that no

0:28:38.980,0:28:44.200
no this is something that I told you

0:28:41.980,0:28:45.490
that you thought this true or like

0:28:44.200,0:28:47.220
something I believed and realized it

0:28:45.490,0:28:50.339
worth it

0:28:47.220,0:28:50.339
[Music]

0:29:01.170,0:29:29.040
from that I find out a little bit true

0:29:26.360,0:29:32.550
they it could be that disagreements

0:29:29.040,0:29:34.800
about his career scientists think that's

0:29:32.550,0:29:37.710
me when I'm doing work sometimes you may

0:29:34.800,0:29:40.980
have the pin and it may not be true or

0:29:37.710,0:29:46.100
it may be the same for me too I don't

0:29:40.980,0:29:46.100
have anything bigger big drastic yes

0:29:47.630,0:29:55.710
in what ways are we cylinder and how

0:29:50.730,0:29:58.890
does that scare you I think we're

0:29:55.710,0:30:00.510
similar in that we're not very social

0:29:58.890,0:30:02.100
like we like being home a lot and

0:30:00.510,0:30:09.630
there's watching our videos and being an

0:30:02.100,0:30:12.920
outlet space I think we don't like

0:30:09.630,0:30:15.420
talking about person stresses or issues

0:30:12.920,0:30:16.590
at all just like it's really

0:30:15.420,0:30:18.480
uncomfortable

0:30:16.590,0:30:21.930
I also think we break down my thoughts a

0:30:18.480,0:30:26.850
lot mean you can't get it up we have a

0:30:21.930,0:30:28.530
common common law and I think with our

0:30:26.850,0:30:31.590
you mentioned two expressing ourselves

0:30:28.530,0:30:32.580
there are and what scares me about the

0:30:31.590,0:30:35.370
socialization

0:30:32.580,0:30:36.659
shucks I mean I without an excellent

0:30:35.370,0:30:38.399
that bullying wasn't really a thing and

0:30:36.659,0:30:45.929
ice in my school tomorrow should go

0:30:38.399,0:30:47.580
today but I worry that your lack of

0:30:45.929,0:30:50.580
socialization is kind of expected

0:30:47.580,0:30:52.799
somehow and lack of talking yeah just

0:30:50.580,0:30:56.070
like when to talk to people are running

0:30:52.799,0:30:57.929
to being around friends and just kind of

0:30:56.070,0:31:02.640
I mean we like me and all tobacco that's

0:30:57.929,0:31:06.000
gonna affect you in high school some way

0:31:02.640,0:31:08.730
and a long do anything I don't go too

0:31:06.000,0:31:13.880
close that isn't telling people that I

0:31:08.730,0:31:16.019
go to school and I think you guys after

0:31:13.880,0:31:18.299
middle school it's hard to keep me in

0:31:16.019,0:31:20.159
touch with them I see once I don't that

0:31:18.299,0:31:21.990
question yeah so you've got a business

0:31:20.159,0:31:25.470
point and well we may be caused a high

0:31:21.990,0:31:29.940
school but I'm cutting I mean it still a

0:31:25.470,0:31:32.039
little we're about to go places so I

0:31:29.940,0:31:37.730
feel it should be easier with friends I

0:31:32.039,0:31:40.670
don't think it's worth those friendships

0:31:37.730,0:31:43.930
my students that happen that a lot of

0:31:40.670,0:31:47.030
things in life but when you're in that

0:31:43.930,0:31:50.480
time period like making it the best you

0:31:47.030,0:31:51.590
can be with those people even if you

0:31:50.480,0:31:53.480
don't be friends with them if you're not

0:31:51.590,0:31:55.100
president after is making those memories

0:31:53.480,0:31:58.730
those people who ever leave you should

0:31:55.100,0:32:02.690
do I feel like ice weird how yes

0:31:58.730,0:32:06.170
seminarian felt public rates or people

0:32:02.690,0:32:07.360
okay work you know how I didn't really

0:32:06.170,0:32:11.300
talk about it

0:32:07.360,0:32:14.230
hard elbow rates for people in the world

0:32:11.300,0:32:18.020
and you didn't talked about it with me

0:32:14.230,0:32:41.500
so this until Italy issues come up on a

0:32:18.020,0:32:44.360
news you talk about it because I guess I

0:32:41.500,0:32:46.310
just well you know how I'm sometimes

0:32:44.360,0:32:51.740
call you that damn they got have it off

0:32:46.310,0:32:54.380
did you know oh I'm afraid I'm kind of

0:32:51.740,0:32:55.550
afraid I because there's a lot of stuff

0:32:54.380,0:32:57.330
that you have to do when you're an adult

0:32:55.550,0:32:59.740
I I don't know

0:32:57.330,0:33:02.830
well I heard about if I don't know all

0:32:59.740,0:33:07.929
the specific details and I always ask

0:33:02.830,0:33:10.090
mommy about it says that there I know

0:33:07.929,0:33:14.950
how Texans work and everything but

0:33:10.090,0:33:17.440
that's giving insurance on everything

0:33:14.950,0:33:22.380
with it it's just hard so you sort of

0:33:17.440,0:33:22.380
maybe like scared and mister for me

0:33:22.440,0:33:30.450
because I feel like I said I would want

0:33:25.720,0:33:30.450
to know now yeah we're especially yeah

0:33:36.240,0:33:48.820
I'm afraid of getting over because I'll

0:33:40.380,0:33:51.279
play also I think I don't want to learn

0:33:48.820,0:33:54.309
the mean so pretty no very much so

0:33:51.279,0:33:55.480
scared for me because like we had a lot

0:33:54.309,0:33:57.190
of their parents and they know about

0:33:55.480,0:33:59.350
parents and as I said Griffin passed

0:33:57.190,0:34:01.210
away like I was parents are the next and

0:33:59.350,0:34:05.500
that scares me so if I'm gonna go there

0:34:01.210,0:34:08.379
they're gonna go that scary and I also

0:34:05.500,0:34:10.899
just think the unknown of the future is

0:34:08.379,0:34:13.450
like prom responsibilities and how many

0:34:10.899,0:34:15.460
like I just don't want any of it so I

0:34:13.450,0:34:17.320
think that's just I mean I want to get

0:34:15.460,0:34:20.260
all that expands like more paper travel

0:34:17.320,0:34:22.780
and go out but as far as like

0:34:20.260,0:34:24.690
responsibilities its accident working I

0:34:22.780,0:34:28.480
don't know

0:34:24.690,0:34:31.419
but the great thing about visual and

0:34:28.480,0:34:34.899
conference I'm scared about that too you

0:34:31.419,0:34:37.260
know it's their order they move around

0:34:34.899,0:34:37.260
that much

0:34:38.320,0:34:42.580
yeah I think about that all the time

0:34:39.460,0:34:45.909
especially in collagen so I would have

0:34:42.580,0:34:48.010
something happen to them I was away okay

0:34:45.909,0:34:50.169
so like that scares me all the time

0:34:48.010,0:34:52.119
because you never know why I was always

0:34:50.169,0:35:03.040
like all on this medicine eccentrics

0:34:52.119,0:35:08.410
like yeah because I feel like since I'm

0:35:03.040,0:35:10.930
a poor kid people might not they are

0:35:08.410,0:35:14.380
looking at too much from I don't get

0:35:10.930,0:35:16.420
problems that people start feeling like

0:35:14.380,0:35:19.140
I'm gonna get order people kind of since

0:35:16.420,0:35:22.800
you haven't even touched her people were

0:35:19.140,0:35:27.430
they won't see many little kids no you

0:35:22.800,0:35:31.960
know know what I mean if I got is like

0:35:27.430,0:35:37.480
he next city if people were very little

0:35:31.960,0:35:43.510
buddies how much we got was that scared

0:35:37.480,0:35:46.960
but nothing the older it gets I think so

0:35:43.510,0:35:49.150
especially I'm just saying I'm here at

0:35:46.960,0:35:51.820
that we have to even be in high school

0:35:49.150,0:35:55.150
and like you guys always for need to

0:35:51.820,0:35:56.560
prove their toughness of masculinity and

0:35:55.150,0:36:00.119
that scares me about you getting over

0:35:56.560,0:36:02.320
there coming from God I hope he's like

0:36:00.119,0:36:03.309
yeah I don't think so either I'm scared

0:36:02.320,0:36:06.939
that other people

0:36:03.309,0:36:09.880
I shall do it you know I've said all

0:36:06.939,0:36:12.549
right it's happens but people what do

0:36:09.880,0:36:16.150
not like bragging about all the time

0:36:12.549,0:36:18.640
winning but I feel actually I realize

0:36:16.150,0:36:27.630
it's how people just more goes to see

0:36:18.640,0:36:27.630

0:40:55.000,0:41:04.150
be open using okay well I think we've

0:40:59.800,0:41:07.920
only this close Stephan offense I mean

0:41:04.150,0:41:07.920
it's just so hard on City I really

0:41:12.410,0:41:21.340
together and I thought we because there

0:41:21.580,0:41:29.990
but also I think that we know then since

0:41:27.950,0:41:33.080
here in colonies and then I'll make one

0:41:29.990,0:41:35.060
more order maybe they probably easy to

0:41:33.080,0:41:41.510
make when you're at college me beat the

0:41:35.060,0:41:44.660
same order know what you're like the

0:41:41.510,0:41:49.420
reason tip now maybe a same because you

0:41:44.660,0:41:49.420
either than somewhere else the same

0:41:51.430,0:41:56.360
yeah it can do stowaway they visit you

0:41:54.710,0:42:00.590

we don't get toast on that sphere we

0:42:07.310,0:42:19.160
were in the house together

0:42:08.780,0:42:20.630
I think already closer because even

0:42:19.160,0:42:22.580
though we may not live together I feel

0:42:20.630,0:42:24.410
because we'll be kind of close to our

0:42:22.580,0:42:26.750
age and we hope that that will be a bit

0:42:24.410,0:42:31.930
soft even more like even more personal

0:42:26.750,0:42:31.930
