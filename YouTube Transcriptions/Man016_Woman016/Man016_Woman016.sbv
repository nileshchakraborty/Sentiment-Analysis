0:00:00.420,0:00:07.319
I love that I have someone to do

0:00:04.080,0:00:10.710
everything I want to do with we you and

0:00:07.319,0:00:11.759
I are always like we're always doing

0:00:10.710,0:00:13.259
something and we're always trying

0:00:11.759,0:00:16.470
something new and I think that's what's

0:00:13.259,0:00:19.490
so exciting and allows us to have so

0:00:16.470,0:00:22.560
much fun is because I think we both

0:00:19.490,0:00:24.119
really love to try new things and like

0:00:22.560,0:00:28.470
you introduced me to things that I

0:00:24.119,0:00:32.850
wouldn't have done and what I saw and I

0:00:28.470,0:00:34.559
also think my relationship with you is

0:00:32.850,0:00:37.290
one of the most open that I've ever had

0:00:34.559,0:00:40.500
like really like with men or friendships

0:00:37.290,0:00:42.690
or whatever just in terms of like I

0:00:40.500,0:00:45.690
truly feel like I can talk to you I'm

0:00:42.690,0:00:47.399
having an issue and you know the same

0:00:45.690,0:00:48.930
goes you know we discuss with one

0:00:47.399,0:00:52.440
another one we're having a problem and

0:00:48.930,0:00:54.719
we can talk about you know anything

0:00:52.440,0:01:08.880
that's going on so I think I really

0:00:54.719,0:01:10.970
enjoy that is when you feel closest to

0:01:08.880,0:01:10.970
me

0:01:13.450,0:01:19.020
[Laughter]

0:01:21.590,0:01:25.690
[Laughter]

0:01:30.110,0:01:33.420
[Laughter]

0:01:53.940,0:02:01.380
if you could change one thing in our

0:01:56.170,0:02:05.190
relationship what would it mean and why

0:02:01.380,0:02:05.190
why should you think about

0:02:14.270,0:02:20.060
I don't know if this is like an active

0:02:18.380,0:02:22.040
thing that we need to change like you

0:02:20.060,0:02:25.160
and I need to think about but I wish

0:02:22.040,0:02:29.870
that we could find a balance more I

0:02:25.160,0:02:32.450
think we really go from like going out

0:02:29.870,0:02:36.290
and like having tons of fun and spending

0:02:32.450,0:02:39.050
way too much money to like stay in and

0:02:36.290,0:02:41.060
being Hermits and I think we both have

0:02:39.050,0:02:43.010
equal amounts of fun doing both of those

0:02:41.060,0:02:48.980
things but I wish there could be a

0:02:43.010,0:02:50.750
balance you know so it's not like I'm a

0:02:48.980,0:02:54.170
mixture of like being on a desert island

0:02:50.750,0:02:56.450
and like going out and living it up but

0:02:54.170,0:02:57.770
I don't think that's a thing that we

0:02:56.450,0:03:08.570
need to change I just think that's the

0:02:57.770,0:03:10.430
thing like that will change when you

0:03:08.570,0:03:14.390
feel closest to me they all right it's

0:03:10.430,0:03:17.210
when the talking zone but it's a second

0:03:14.390,0:03:19.670
disagreement or gesturing talking to a

0:03:17.210,0:03:22.940
better understanding of the each one is

0:03:19.670,0:03:25.310
coming for an idea perspective and it's

0:03:22.940,0:03:29.360
like a reasonable adult discussion I

0:03:25.310,0:03:31.130
mean just and even if you agree with it

0:03:29.360,0:03:32.630
or disagree make sure we just that

0:03:31.130,0:03:35.030
understand how we should our thinking

0:03:32.630,0:04:05.240
and how we ask people and that's what if

0:03:35.030,0:04:10.180
we process yeah doesn't matter do you

0:04:05.240,0:04:10.180
want us to was you

0:04:14.270,0:04:20.010
you know I feel like I go back and forth

0:04:16.950,0:04:26.190
on this a lot some days I think it's me

0:04:20.010,0:04:28.200
some days I think it's you I think I'd

0:04:26.190,0:04:31.500
say that I probably have a little bit

0:04:28.200,0:04:34.230
more power in the relationship and I

0:04:31.500,0:04:35.940
don't I think I'm only saying that out

0:04:34.230,0:04:39.180
loud because I have to because I'm being

0:04:35.940,0:04:41.910
asked that question and maybe it's a

0:04:39.180,0:04:43.560
just a beautiful thing that I feel like

0:04:41.910,0:04:44.940
I have power in the relationship and if

0:04:43.560,0:04:46.470
the question had gone the way it was

0:04:44.940,0:04:51.210
supposed to and I asked you maybe you'd

0:04:46.470,0:04:53.250
say the same thing and that's for me in

0:04:51.210,0:04:56.600
terms of like where I've been in my past

0:04:53.250,0:05:02.940
like with other relationships like I

0:04:56.600,0:05:04.890
don't I don't feel I think it's

0:05:02.940,0:05:08.220
different I don't think I have more

0:05:04.890,0:05:13.290
power and I can hold it over you or use

0:05:08.220,0:05:19.020
it and do what I feel I feel powerful in

0:05:13.290,0:05:23.030
this and I feel like you know my words

0:05:19.020,0:05:23.030
are being heard and what I need is being

0:05:24.530,0:05:31.919
understood and assessed and so you know

0:05:29.450,0:05:34.590
you might feel you have the most power

0:05:31.919,0:05:36.810
in the relationship because you know

0:05:34.590,0:05:38.130
hopefully vice versa but I don't think I

0:05:36.810,0:05:40.140
think for the first time I'm in a

0:05:38.130,0:05:42.510
relationship where that isn't a nasty

0:05:40.140,0:05:45.300
thing like who has the most power is

0:05:42.510,0:05:46.950
like oh and I can use this over

0:05:45.300,0:05:49.470
somebody's head because I have more

0:05:46.950,0:05:53.850
power I think it's like a beautiful sort

0:05:49.470,0:05:57.990
of like the way we are with each other

0:05:53.850,0:06:01.860
allows us to have you know autonomy and

0:05:57.990,0:06:05.700
and I don't I don't feel like I've ever

0:06:01.860,0:06:08.450
felt settle for that one time one time

0:06:05.700,0:06:08.450
on the f30

0:06:10.330,0:06:14.020
[Laughter]

0:06:16.310,0:06:23.050
so just so it's not hot I do look inside

0:06:20.050,0:06:23.050
hidden

0:06:27.430,0:06:33.370
I should say like cables to him and

0:06:31.820,0:06:35.900
we're at the top of the stairs

0:06:33.370,0:06:39.500
Nancy stop with me after train yeah that

0:06:35.900,0:06:48.050
I see me go 2nd Ave I was dropping him

0:06:39.500,0:06:50.090
off and when he didn't have an answer

0:06:48.050,0:06:52.520
for me in ten seconds he made me sad and

0:06:50.090,0:06:53.390
I was upset so at that moment you had

0:06:52.520,0:07:18.880
more power

0:06:53.390,0:07:18.880
Oh what are you hesitant to tell me

0:07:26.550,0:07:32.469
well I was gonna tell you about my

0:07:28.780,0:07:34.360
second my doubts about us moving in

0:07:32.469,0:07:37.360
together whatever they actually brought

0:07:34.360,0:07:39.729
it up recently so I would listen out so

0:07:37.360,0:07:43.330
that was the answer I was most on my

0:07:39.729,0:07:45.099
mind that if I like tell you that I had

0:07:43.330,0:07:46.240
dogs because I know you wanted it to

0:07:45.099,0:07:50.139
happen if things are still walking

0:07:46.240,0:07:52.120
around I'm part of like disappointing

0:07:50.139,0:07:53.979

disappointing people but I when she had

0:07:53.979,0:07:58.479

0:08:02.520,0:08:10.060

0:08:08.080,0:08:18.250
would happen if it didn't work into two

0:08:10.060,0:08:20.469

like you know come treat me how I would

0:10:24.550,0:10:31.350
actually do but he's got something in a

0:10:26.950,0:10:31.350
moment that's what I'm disappointed I

0:10:32.790,0:10:37.150
feel better I mean I think I've told you

0:10:35.110,0:10:39.490
we've talked about it I mean would right

0:10:37.150,0:10:41.440
I'd say the bullet it's not like I'm

0:10:39.490,0:10:42.760
perfect you're perfect but you talked

0:10:41.440,0:10:44.290
about it and this that goes back to what

0:10:42.760,0:10:47.110
I said before when I free process to use

0:10:44.290,0:10:57.430
man you've been able to use with the

0:10:47.110,0:10:59.500
rest come to an understanding yeah do we

0:10:57.430,0:11:04.900
have enough sex

0:10:59.500,0:11:04.900
[Laughter]

0:11:09.420,0:11:15.380
still living art so there's usually a

0:11:12.880,0:11:19.270
couple days in between

0:11:15.380,0:11:19.270
whether we usually have sex quite a bit

0:11:32.920,0:11:36.860
[Laughter]

0:11:42.750,0:11:45.809
[Music]

0:12:07.810,0:12:47.810
about yeah maybe haven't tried them but

0:12:16.460,0:12:55.030
I vocalize them I the best sex yes I

0:12:47.810,0:12:55.030
think so I think

0:12:56.590,0:13:02.160
basically you're definitely like top -

0:13:04.200,0:13:10.330
listen listen every I mean every time

0:13:09.070,0:13:12.250
you have sex it's you know it's a

0:13:10.330,0:13:13.750
totally different thing even if it's the

0:13:12.250,0:13:14.830
same person and so like there are some

0:13:13.750,0:13:20.200
times that are better there's something

0:13:14.830,0:13:28.390
worse and like for the physicality of it

0:13:20.200,0:13:30.520
like we have great sex and I don't have

0:13:28.390,0:13:34.150
great sex or I haven't had always great

0:13:30.520,0:13:35.950
sex in my life so it's not just but the

0:13:34.150,0:13:39.810
reason why I would say that you're the

0:13:35.950,0:13:42.550
best sex I've had in my life is because

0:13:39.810,0:13:45.700
sex isn't just about the physicality of

0:13:42.550,0:13:49.360
it there's a lot more to it and can get

0:13:45.700,0:13:52.170
a lot more fun when you like really care

0:13:49.360,0:13:57.360
about the person that you're with and it

0:13:52.170,0:14:01.030
totally like elevates the experience

0:13:57.360,0:14:04.300
elevates is the right word and I think I

0:14:01.030,0:14:05.920
care about you so much more than the

0:14:04.300,0:14:09.910
other people that I've had sex with and

0:14:05.920,0:14:12.130
I care about you enjoying it and you

0:14:09.910,0:14:14.050
having a good time and you don't wanting

0:14:12.130,0:14:16.330
it to be great for both of us and I

0:14:14.050,0:14:20.380
think that really and I feel that with

0:14:16.330,0:14:23.410
you too and I think you know just by and

0:14:20.380,0:14:25.830
large you have great sex and things

0:14:23.410,0:14:25.830
aren't just

0:14:59.930,0:15:05.040
the funny thing is we're like Herron was

0:15:02.760,0:15:33.269
staying out parachuting like you know

0:15:05.040,0:15:35.279
have a really open confrontation you

0:15:33.269,0:15:50.370
ever think about other people dirty sex

0:15:35.279,0:15:57.060
to our pawsome a question how much porn

0:15:50.370,0:15:59.610
do you watch meeting um those are two

0:15:57.060,0:16:01.800
very very different answers there are

0:15:59.610,0:16:04.140
like how much porn I watch regularly in

0:16:01.800,0:16:46.050
my real life I should say real life

0:16:04.140,0:16:48.990
before you actually don't like why don't

0:16:46.050,0:16:50.850
you like porn doesn't mean too much for

0:16:48.990,0:16:53.610
me yeah

0:16:50.850,0:16:55.649
just yeah I mean I've watched it and I

0:16:53.610,0:16:58.259
can enjoy it but it doesn't do as much

0:16:55.649,0:16:59.759
for me as actually doing of me being in

0:16:58.259,0:17:07.169
activity I care

0:16:59.759,0:17:11.120
you don't say like I know what feel

0:17:07.169,0:17:11.120
place before I want to go dampen myself

0:17:27.110,0:17:39.630
what important to that you wish I would

0:17:29.850,0:17:44.010
do unrealistic and I'm really kicking

0:17:39.630,0:17:46.590
anything honestly like what is more

0:17:44.010,0:17:54.059
unrealistic for women in women actions

0:17:46.590,0:17:57.330
but I don't think I don't feel like

0:17:54.059,0:18:08.159
anything is like missing from the male

0:17:57.330,0:18:09.809
speech like what men are doing it you

0:18:08.159,0:18:10.980
try sex in different places that happens

0:18:09.809,0:18:20.760
important but that's not because I'm a

0:18:10.980,0:18:24.419
man what do the women in porn do that

0:18:20.760,0:18:24.970
you wish I would do you know all the

0:18:24.419,0:18:32.120
things I want

0:18:24.970,0:18:32.120
[Laughter]

0:18:38.710,0:19:17.840
what's your favorite kind of porn like

0:19:15.400,0:19:20.510
typical corn patch and I think I watch a

0:19:17.840,0:19:21.680
lot of those when I did choose to watch

0:19:20.510,0:19:23.840
porn because I really don't watch much

0:19:21.680,0:19:36.820
anymore it was like the woods were like

0:19:23.840,0:20:09.050
someone happened upon someone else and

0:19:36.820,0:20:10.640
also have you ever chosen over me what

0:20:09.050,0:20:14.930
do you get from poem that I don't give

0:20:10.640,0:20:16.520
you well I told you that but together I

0:20:14.930,0:20:19.490
really stopped watching porn I'm gonna

0:20:16.520,0:20:21.980
say not much I don't really watch more

0:20:19.490,0:20:24.020
and I think like if there were ever an

0:20:21.980,0:20:26.120
extended period of time that we weren't

0:20:24.020,0:20:26.540
together like for whatever reason I

0:20:26.120,0:20:28.370
think

0:20:26.540,0:20:41.960
probably would watch porn as like a

0:20:28.370,0:20:49.580
supplement but how do you feel about me

0:20:41.960,0:20:51.470
watching porn I feel fine it doesn't

0:20:49.580,0:20:52.190
depends and I'll ask questions I go play

0:20:51.470,0:20:56.170
with mine

0:20:52.190,0:20:56.170
once it'd be twice independency

0:20:59.390,0:21:06.200
[Laughter]

0:21:03.730,0:21:08.540
uncomfortable River just like like you

0:21:06.200,0:21:10.990
said if I was going for week or two and

0:21:08.540,0:21:13.920
you did it for supplemental reasons

0:21:10.990,0:21:18.749
that's fine

0:21:13.920,0:21:18.749
[Laughter]
