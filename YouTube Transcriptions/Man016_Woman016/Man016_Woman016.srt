1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,319
I love that I have someone to do

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,710
everything I want to do with we you and

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,759
I are always like we're always doing

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,259
something and we're always trying

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,470
something new and I think that's what's

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,490
so exciting and allows us to have so

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,560
much fun is because I think we both

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,119
really love to try new things and like

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,470
you introduced me to things that I

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:32,850
wouldn't have done and what I saw and I

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,559
also think my relationship with you is

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,290
one of the most open that I've ever had

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,500
like really like with men or friendships

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,690
or whatever just in terms of like I

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,690
truly feel like I can talk to you I'm

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,399
having an issue and you know the same

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,930
goes you know we discuss with one

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,440
another one we're having a problem and

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,719
we can talk about you know anything

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:08,880
that's going on so I think I really

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:10,970
enjoy that is when you feel closest to

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,970
me

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:19,020
[Laughter]

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,690
[Laughter]

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,420
[Laughter]

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:01,380
if you could change one thing in our

27
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:05,190
relationship what would it mean and why

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,190
why should you think about

29
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,060
I don't know if this is like an active

30
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,040
thing that we need to change like you

31
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,160
and I need to think about but I wish

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,870
that we could find a balance more I

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:32,450
think we really go from like going out

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,290
and like having tons of fun and spending

35
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,050
way too much money to like stay in and

36
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,060
being Hermits and I think we both have

37
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,010
equal amounts of fun doing both of those

38
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:48,980
things but I wish there could be a

39
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:50,750
balance you know so it's not like I'm a

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,170
mixture of like being on a desert island

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,450
and like going out and living it up but

42
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,770
I don't think that's a thing that we

43
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:08,570
need to change I just think that's the

44
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:10,430
thing like that will change when you

45
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:14,390
feel closest to me they all right it's

46
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:17,210
when the talking zone but it's a second

47
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,670
disagreement or gesturing talking to a

48
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,940
better understanding of the each one is

49
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,310
coming for an idea perspective and it's

50
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,360
like a reasonable adult discussion I

51
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,130
mean just and even if you agree with it

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,630
or disagree make sure we just that

53
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,030
understand how we should our thinking

54
00:03:32,630 --> 00:04:05,240
and how we ask people and that's what if

55
00:03:35,030 --> 00:04:10,180
we process yeah doesn't matter do you

56
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,180
want us to was you

57
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:20,010
you know I feel like I go back and forth

58
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:26,190
on this a lot some days I think it's me

59
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:28,200
some days I think it's you I think I'd

60
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,500
say that I probably have a little bit

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,230
more power in the relationship and I

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,940
don't I think I'm only saying that out

63
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,180
loud because I have to because I'm being

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,910
asked that question and maybe it's a

65
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,560
just a beautiful thing that I feel like

66
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,940
I have power in the relationship and if

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,470
the question had gone the way it was

68
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,210
supposed to and I asked you maybe you'd

69
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:53,250
say the same thing and that's for me in

70
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,600
terms of like where I've been in my past

71
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:02,940
like with other relationships like I

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:04,890
don't I don't feel I think it's

73
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,220
different I don't think I have more

74
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:13,290
power and I can hold it over you or use

75
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:19,020
it and do what I feel I feel powerful in

76
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:23,030
this and I feel like you know my words

77
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,030
are being heard and what I need is being

78
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:31,919
understood and assessed and so you know

79
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,590
you might feel you have the most power

80
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,810
in the relationship because you know

81
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,130
hopefully vice versa but I don't think I

82
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,140
think for the first time I'm in a

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,510
relationship where that isn't a nasty

84
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,300
thing like who has the most power is

85
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,950
like oh and I can use this over

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,470
somebody's head because I have more

87
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:53,850
power I think it's like a beautiful sort

88
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:57,990
of like the way we are with each other

89
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:01,860
allows us to have you know autonomy and

90
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:05,700
and I don't I don't feel like I've ever

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,450
felt settle for that one time one time

92
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,450
on the f30

93
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,020
[Laughter]

94
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:23,050
so just so it's not hot I do look inside

95
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,050
hidden

96
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,370
I should say like cables to him and

97
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,900
we're at the top of the stairs

98
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,500
Nancy stop with me after train yeah that

99
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:48,050
I see me go 2nd Ave I was dropping him

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:50,090
off and when he didn't have an answer

101
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,520
for me in ten seconds he made me sad and

102
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,390
I was upset so at that moment you had

103
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:18,880
more power

104
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:18,880
Oh what are you hesitant to tell me

105
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,469
well I was gonna tell you about my

106
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,360
second my doubts about us moving in

107
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:37,360
together whatever they actually brought

108
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,729
it up recently so I would listen out so

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,330
that was the answer I was most on my

110
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:45,099
mind that if I like tell you that I had

111
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,240
dogs because I know you wanted it to

112
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:50,139
happen if things are still walking

113
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,120
around I'm part of like disappointing

114
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,979
people I don't like to feel like I'm

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,330

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,440
I'd say the bullet it's not like I'm

158
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,760
perfect you're perfect but you talked

159
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,290
about it and this that goes back to what

160
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,110
I said before when I free process to use

161
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:57,430
man you've been able to use with the

162
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:59,500
rest come to an understanding yeah do we

163
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:04,900
have enough sex

164
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,900
[Laughter]

165
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,380
still living art so there's usually a

166
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,270
couple days in between

167
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,270
whether we usually have sex quite a bit

168
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,860
[Laughter]

169
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,809
[Music]

170
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:47,810
about yeah maybe haven't tried them but

171
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:55,030
I vocalize them I the best sex yes I

172
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:55,030
think so I think

173
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:02,160
basically you're definitely like top -

174
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,330
listen listen every I mean every time

175
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,250
you have sex it's you know it's a

176
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,750
totally different thing even if it's the

177
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,830
same person and so like there are some

178
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,200
times that are better there's something

179
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:28,390
worse and like for the physicality of it

180
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:30,520
like we have great sex and I don't have

181
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:34,150
great sex or I haven't had always great

182
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,950
sex in my life so it's not just but the

183
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,810
reason why I would say that you're the

184
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:42,550
best sex I've had in my life is because

185
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,700
sex isn't just about the physicality of

186
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:49,360
it there's a lot more to it and can get

187
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:52,170
a lot more fun when you like really care

188
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:57,360
about the person that you're with and it

189
00:13:52,170 --> 00:14:01,030
totally like elevates the experience

190
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,300
elevates is the right word and I think I

191
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,920
care about you so much more than the

192
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,910
other people that I've had sex with and

193
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,130
I care about you enjoying it and you

194
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,050
having a good time and you don't wanting

195
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,330
it to be great for both of us and I

196
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,380
think that really and I feel that with

197
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:23,410
you too and I think you know just by and

198
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,830
large you have great sex and things

199
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,830
aren't just

200
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,040
the funny thing is we're like Herron was

201
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:33,269
staying out parachuting like you know

202
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:35,279
have a really open confrontation you

203
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:50,370
ever think about other people dirty sex

204
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:57,060
to our pawsome a question how much porn

205
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:59,610
do you watch meeting um those are two

206
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,800
very very different answers there are

207
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,140
like how much porn I watch regularly in

208
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:46,050
my real life I should say real life

209
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:48,990
before you actually don't like why don't

210
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,850
you like porn doesn't mean too much for

211
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,610
me yeah

212
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,649
just yeah I mean I've watched it and I

213
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,259
can enjoy it but it doesn't do as much

214
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:59,759
for me as actually doing of me being in

215
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:07,169
activity I care

216
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:11,120
you don't say like I know what feel

217
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:11,120
place before I want to go dampen myself

218
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:39,630
what important to that you wish I would

219
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:44,010
do unrealistic and I'm really kicking

220
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:46,590
anything honestly like what is more

221
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:54,059
unrealistic for women in women actions

222
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:57,330
but I don't think I don't feel like

223
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:08,159
anything is like missing from the male

224
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:09,809
speech like what men are doing it you

225
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,980
try sex in different places that happens

226
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:20,760
important but that's not because I'm a

227
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:24,419
man what do the women in porn do that

228
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,970
you wish I would do you know all the

229
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:32,120
things I want

230
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:32,120
[Laughter]

231
00:18:38,710 --> 00:19:17,840
what's your favorite kind of porn like

232
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,510
typical corn patch and I think I watch a

233
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,680
lot of those when I did choose to watch

234
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,840
porn because I really don't watch much

235
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:36,820
anymore it was like the woods were like

236
00:19:23,840 --> 00:20:09,050
someone happened upon someone else and

237
00:19:36,820 --> 00:20:10,640
also have you ever chosen over me what

238
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:14,930
do you get from poem that I don't give

239
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,520
you well I told you that but together I

240
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,490
really stopped watching porn I'm gonna

241
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,980
say not much I don't really watch more

242
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,020
and I think like if there were ever an

243
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,120
extended period of time that we weren't

244
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,540
together like for whatever reason I

245
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,370
think

246
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:41,960
probably would watch porn as like a

247
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:49,580
supplement but how do you feel about me

248
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:51,470
watching porn I feel fine it doesn't

249
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,190
depends and I'll ask questions I go play

250
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,170
with mine

251
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,170
once it'd be twice independency

252
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:06,200
[Laughter]

253
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,540
uncomfortable River just like like you

254
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,990
said if I was going for week or two and

255
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,920
you did it for supplemental reasons

256
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:18,749
that's fine

257
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,749
[Laughter]
