0:00:04.549,0:00:21.240
when you think about the first time we

0:00:06.690,0:00:31.080
met what do you remember I remember and

0:00:21.240,0:00:34.950
just being amazed at how kind your eyes

0:00:31.080,0:00:38.629
were like honestly it was just but I've

0:00:34.950,0:00:42.510
always kind of thing about that what

0:00:38.629,0:00:48.739
that was and then you know the fact that

0:00:42.510,0:00:51.000
you kept forgetting me obviously that's

0:00:48.739,0:00:53.520
from that day that's one of the things

0:00:51.000,0:00:56.340
that I just remember thinking that he

0:00:53.520,0:01:05.460
smiles with his eyes and there are the

0:00:56.340,0:01:10.979
kindest eyes I've ever seen you know you

0:01:05.460,0:01:13.159
know this guy what do you love about our

0:01:10.979,0:01:13.159
relationship

0:01:17.649,0:01:26.140
the fact that no matter what you're my

0:01:21.040,0:01:30.130
friend at the end of the day is we can

0:01:26.140,0:01:31.659
have good days bad days argue about

0:01:30.130,0:01:36.490
stupid stuff at the end of the day

0:01:31.659,0:01:41.140
you're my best friend I think that's

0:01:36.490,0:01:44.020
probably one of the most important

0:01:41.140,0:01:47.979
things to me it's the fact that you

0:01:44.020,0:01:58.270
truly are my friend you know you know

0:01:47.979,0:02:03.970
just my fuck buddy I never sugarcoat

0:01:58.270,0:02:10.830
anything do you know it's actually kind

0:02:03.970,0:02:10.830
of fun when do you feel closest to me

0:02:19.510,0:02:30.040
I'd have to say when probably when

0:02:30.310,0:02:42.890
you've been there me most the lowest

0:02:35.120,0:02:45.800
points where mama died you'll have to

0:02:42.890,0:02:54.770
let you know I think that's enough when

0:02:45.800,0:02:59.590
I'm at my lowest gonna be anything but

0:02:54.770,0:03:02.030
what are you hesitant to tell me nothing

0:02:59.590,0:03:05.270
absolutely nothing I think that's bull

0:03:02.030,0:03:05.780
no you know every little thing about my

0:03:05.270,0:03:08.630
life

0:03:05.780,0:03:12.140
before and after there's nothing that

0:03:08.630,0:03:14.990
you pause before you tell me or anything

0:03:12.140,0:03:16.940
like that there are things that wait and

0:03:14.990,0:03:18.650
if I feel like if something's going to

0:03:16.940,0:03:21.580
hurt your feelings I will pause but I

0:03:18.650,0:03:25.430
mean I never hold anything from you

0:03:21.580,0:03:33.860
there's no point it's Jo you talking you

0:03:25.430,0:03:35.810
sleep oh do we have enough sex no this

0:03:33.860,0:03:38.300
is a question every guy asks no then

0:03:35.810,0:03:40.070
ninety nine so that honestly and every

0:03:38.300,0:03:43.520
guy does probably ask it every single

0:03:40.070,0:03:45.890
one of our friends does I do not put out

0:03:43.520,0:03:49.160
enough I can tell you that right now but

0:03:45.890,0:03:52.280
I will say that let me do it is quality

0:03:49.160,0:03:53.840
and you know honestly I don't really

0:03:52.280,0:03:56.380
know that many people that have been

0:03:53.840,0:03:59.060
together as long as we have better still

0:03:56.380,0:04:00.350
even having as much sex as we have town

0:03:59.060,0:04:04.640
we know people that haven't touched each

0:04:00.350,0:04:06.860
other in years well I kind of know this

0:04:04.640,0:04:10.360
answer who has more power in the

0:04:06.860,0:04:10.360
relationship you or me

0:04:11.890,0:04:19.250
next question everyone knows answer that

0:04:15.850,0:04:23.240
you know you do you know it's all about

0:04:19.250,0:04:27.200
you I think I like to think I'm in

0:04:23.240,0:04:36.770
charge from time to time built on your

0:04:27.200,0:04:38.210
neck hey turn the head great what

0:04:36.770,0:04:41.780
bothered you about being the sole income

0:04:38.210,0:04:47.660
provider well that's actually more your

0:04:41.780,0:04:52.430
question since I'm really not that's

0:04:47.660,0:04:55.220
more than your question to answer I know

0:04:52.430,0:05:01.580
it makes me feel awkward and it makes me

0:04:55.220,0:05:04.280
feel then I'm not keeping up my end of

0:05:01.580,0:05:07.100
the bargain it's not exactly cheap I

0:05:04.280,0:05:08.870
live over here and stuff you know yeah

0:05:07.100,0:05:14.600
but I'll never understand what you think

0:05:08.870,0:05:19.130
like that because I've always had my own

0:05:14.600,0:05:23.390
job my own income been so completely

0:05:19.130,0:05:29.260
self-reliant that I took the past two

0:05:23.390,0:05:33.080
years have been really rough I mean I

0:05:29.260,0:05:33.970
really feel like I've lost part of my

0:05:33.080,0:05:37.880
identity

0:05:33.970,0:05:43.610
so not I got any the little strong more

0:05:37.880,0:05:45.860
like um know a little bit of the

0:05:43.610,0:05:48.080
security in who I was and who I am and

0:05:45.860,0:05:53.260
who I knew myself to be for so long and

0:05:48.080,0:05:55.460
especially because I was so in my career

0:05:53.260,0:05:58.160
the entire time that we've been together

0:05:55.460,0:06:04.430
that this is just a completely weird

0:05:58.160,0:06:07.220
misstep for me you know yeah everyone

0:06:04.430,0:06:08.360
has hard times and we're a couple so it

0:06:07.220,0:06:18.289
doesn't know

0:06:08.360,0:06:21.490
I know wow in the back of your mind are

0:06:18.289,0:06:21.490
you scared that I'll walk away

0:06:28.869,0:06:38.180
at times I think everyone thinks that I

0:06:34.249,0:06:39.610
haven't thought that but again a long

0:06:38.180,0:06:43.639
time ago

0:06:39.610,0:06:46.659
well we bid through I don't think it

0:06:43.639,0:06:52.219
anymore I did one time not anymore

0:06:46.659,0:06:55.159
my when things were tough back in the

0:06:52.219,0:06:59.059
day when I was let's be like barely

0:06:55.159,0:07:03.129
working it was hard it was really really

0:06:59.059,0:07:06.729
hard because I always felt like I was

0:07:03.129,0:07:10.069
not living up to your expectations

0:07:06.729,0:07:12.949
sort of like the way I feel now but

0:07:10.069,0:07:29.059
we've both been there and we've gotten

0:07:12.949,0:07:31.249
through everything right oh this is very

0:07:29.059,0:07:34.130
end up with the sex questions you guys

0:07:31.249,0:07:36.999
am I the best sex you've ever had

0:07:34.130,0:07:42.379
[Laughter]

0:07:36.999,0:07:48.919
already no it's no so that's terrible

0:07:42.379,0:07:52.789
this is this is bad no no no to say I'm

0:07:48.919,0:07:57.529
gonna gather for a very long time no to

0:07:52.789,0:07:59.959
say that it's not that it's you're not

0:07:57.529,0:08:02.360
the best sex I've ever had

0:07:59.959,0:08:03.649
well no I mean we've been together for

0:08:02.360,0:08:06.229
almost 20 years

0:08:03.649,0:08:13.909
no no I know but it's just it's so

0:08:06.229,0:08:16.669
awkward for me it's no secret we can

0:08:13.909,0:08:22.459
just name it I know why it's it's the

0:08:16.669,0:08:25.339
kind of thing where no but the type of

0:08:22.459,0:08:26.990
sex that we have is a different type of

0:08:25.339,0:08:30.469
sex than I've ever had with anyone else

0:08:26.990,0:08:32.630
so to just randomly compare it one it's

0:08:30.469,0:08:34.430
apples and oranges is obnoxious at that

0:08:32.630,0:08:36.589
you know yeah it's all fruit it's all

0:08:34.430,0:08:39.880
straight sex granted this you know

0:08:36.589,0:08:44.300
different flavors

0:08:39.880,0:08:47.660
but it's it's a completely it's a

0:08:44.300,0:08:52.160
different scenario it's not like I can

0:08:47.660,0:08:54.889
equally wear a moment the other but I

0:08:52.160,0:08:56.839
don't talk to you about this I don't

0:08:54.889,0:08:59.480
think we really do talk about this in

0:08:56.839,0:09:02.029
all the time that very rare we very rare

0:08:59.480,0:09:04.370
yeah like yeah no so that was kinda

0:09:02.029,0:09:08.060
interesting yeah wow that's terrible no

0:09:04.370,0:09:16.029
it's it did you ever want children with

0:09:08.060,0:09:16.029
me yes I don't even have to hesitate yes

0:09:30.130,0:09:34.329
how do you feel we've grown apart

0:09:39.470,0:10:01.640
I think the older that we are just we're

0:09:56.420,0:10:06.010
not as forgiving enough to write them in

0:10:01.640,0:10:08.930
the right words but I don't think that

0:10:06.010,0:10:13.550
we gave each other a lot of leeway with

0:10:08.930,0:10:14.950
certain subjects anymore like I'm not

0:10:13.550,0:10:17.930
gonna put up with you when you do

0:10:14.950,0:10:19.880
conservative Republican bullshit because

0:10:17.930,0:10:21.590
you know conservative Republican is

0:10:19.880,0:10:25.280
someone you say shit like that it really

0:10:21.590,0:10:27.650
drives me batshit and I won't put up

0:10:25.280,0:10:29.810
with any more and I tell you you know to

0:10:27.650,0:10:37.250
shut up I think in terms of stuff like

0:10:29.810,0:10:39.890
that but I don't think that we've really

0:10:37.250,0:10:42.530
grown apart in that way unless you are

0:10:39.890,0:10:45.230
saying like the whole sexually thing

0:10:42.530,0:10:49.000
which is again I just consider that

0:10:45.230,0:10:54.410
normal and I'm so that um you know I

0:10:49.000,0:11:06.830
don't felt like I'm 20 anymore I just we

0:10:54.410,0:11:09.100
you know what would you do if I cheated

0:11:06.830,0:11:09.100
on you

0:11:09.130,0:11:19.760
[Laughter]

0:11:14.500,0:11:23.900
something like honestly though I already

0:11:19.760,0:11:28.400
kind of know we can sort of go by this

0:11:23.900,0:11:29.030
one oh well this I would not be a happy

0:11:28.400,0:11:33.650
man

0:11:29.030,0:11:35.570
I just I just just because of the

0:11:33.650,0:11:38.630
history game one of those it's just not

0:11:35.570,0:11:41.800
something yeah don't you have to be

0:11:38.630,0:11:44.580
concerned about it I'm very into time

0:11:41.800,0:11:47.160
one who said before I start another no I

0:11:44.580,0:11:51.390
wouldn't do that

0:11:47.160,0:11:51.390
we both know each other better than that

0:11:54.450,0:11:58.500
what are you scared to tell me

0:12:09.120,0:12:18.490
when I fuck up bad I know it sounds old

0:12:13.420,0:12:22.690
or ridiculous but it's more it's more a

0:12:18.490,0:12:26.500
matter of it's not when I messed up so

0:12:22.690,0:12:29.230
much it's where I do something or I

0:12:26.500,0:12:30.730
don't do something or I procrastinate

0:12:29.230,0:12:33.940
about something to the point where I

0:12:30.730,0:12:38.890
think you're going to be disappointed in

0:12:33.940,0:12:40.230
me it's almost like I don't want to

0:12:38.890,0:12:43.720
disappoint you

0:12:40.230,0:12:46.900
you don't I mean it's not so it's not

0:12:43.720,0:12:50.470
like you know like be afraid to tell you

0:12:46.900,0:12:51.670
something it's just you know like going

0:12:50.470,0:12:52.930
out and drinking too much wine and

0:12:51.670,0:12:55.290
falling asleep in the cab on the way

0:12:52.930,0:12:57.850
home and losing my phone you know like

0:12:55.290,0:13:01.110
the same shit everybody does except you

0:12:57.850,0:13:04.840
know they did it fifteen years younger I

0:13:01.110,0:13:06.760
mean stuff like that it's it's more I

0:13:04.840,0:13:11.460
don't want to disappoint you and I don't

0:13:06.760,0:13:19.050
want to embarrass myself by being

0:13:11.460,0:13:19.050
immature but I kind of feel like no no

0:13:19.530,0:13:23.860
fuck it sometimes I'm gonna disappoint

0:13:22.060,0:13:26.530
you but you love me anyway

0:13:23.860,0:13:31.180
okay so it's not really like there's

0:13:26.530,0:13:37.650
nothing really that I'd be like afraid

0:13:31.180,0:13:37.650
talking about but hmm

0:13:37.749,0:13:41.899
do you feel like we've lived up to the

0:13:40.220,0:13:49.489
dreams we had when we started this

0:13:41.899,0:13:53.350
relationship why or why not I don't

0:13:49.489,0:13:53.350
think we've lived up to our potential

0:13:55.720,0:14:03.859
because well it's good to have you give

0:13:59.449,0:14:07.069
me a moment there's just been so many

0:14:03.859,0:14:10.579
things I've happened along the way with

0:14:07.069,0:14:15.109
family and everything and loss of jobs

0:14:10.579,0:14:19.489
and it's just it's hard sometimes when

0:14:15.109,0:14:30.230
it when you I thought by this time we we

0:14:19.489,0:14:35.829
don't know already it's just sometimes

0:14:30.230,0:14:35.829
just talking I think that's probably I

0:14:36.129,0:14:45.110
never really wanted the house no I never

0:14:42.889,0:14:48.319
would even even like I didn't want to

0:14:45.110,0:14:52.639
watch it but you know to have a space of

0:14:48.319,0:14:57.410
do you and I have a family you know be

0:14:52.639,0:15:01.129
like Auntie Mame you know like all that

0:14:57.410,0:15:05.529
I really wanted but it hasn't worked out

0:15:01.129,0:15:05.529
like that well it's it's not over yet

0:15:09.540,0:15:20.860
see your truth of mine I actually don't

0:15:13.889,0:15:22.389
go just go with us man was the biggest

0:15:20.860,0:15:24.899
compromise you've made I haven't

0:15:22.389,0:15:24.899
acknowledged

0:15:34.740,0:15:50.490
I don't think that don't think go into

0:15:46.320,0:15:56.310
that huh I just I don't think it's

0:15:50.490,0:16:02.610
anything that you haven't acknowledged

0:15:56.310,0:16:07.040
per se without delving into more of it I

0:16:02.610,0:16:13.649
think it's more you don't take it as

0:16:07.040,0:16:18.680
serious as I think I don't think you

0:16:13.649,0:16:18.680
realize how much it affects me

0:16:28.160,0:16:38.450
why do you love me I honestly I can't

0:16:35.270,0:16:44.260
even narrow that down why I I just don't

0:16:38.450,0:16:49.640
I can't have anything everything

0:16:44.260,0:17:04.819
everything that makes you you this corny

0:16:49.640,0:17:06.079
Sophie's that sounds it's just you what

0:17:04.819,0:17:12.949
do I do that detracts from our

0:17:06.079,0:17:14.569
relationship oh my god you become like

0:17:12.949,0:17:27.430
and eat your own boy and you have a

0:17:14.569,0:17:27.430
temper tantrum beg for Captain Crunch

0:17:33.250,0:17:38.020
because I left one sheet of paper towel

0:17:39.340,0:17:44.720
you're having an epic meltdown like I

0:17:43.220,0:17:47.560
was just like no you can't have the

0:17:44.720,0:17:53.120
boxes here fucking doing it like really

0:17:47.560,0:17:56.900
back Roy is probably that's up there

0:17:53.120,0:18:03.640
that's my hissy fits well and I mean

0:17:56.900,0:18:03.640
what is your question that might

0:18:10.110,0:18:14.850
in the time that we have shared together

0:18:12.310,0:18:20.700
do you have any resentment toward me

0:18:14.850,0:18:28.590
though see no I don't think that's true

0:18:20.700,0:18:28.590
why do you think that's true I think I

0:18:29.370,0:18:38.110
don't know so much now because you're in

0:18:34.450,0:18:39.610
a power position without sounding

0:18:38.110,0:18:41.230
amounts just I don't mean it like you

0:18:39.610,0:18:46.060
know like you mourn over me or anything

0:18:41.230,0:18:48.990
but relationship wise right now you're

0:18:46.060,0:18:57.970
in a power position and I think that

0:18:48.990,0:19:01.120
when I was still VP company and I was

0:18:57.970,0:19:04.000
devoting so much time to my career and

0:19:01.120,0:19:05.650
something that was so outside of us and

0:19:04.000,0:19:10.620
outside of our relationship and our

0:19:05.650,0:19:14.380
lives together I think that part of you

0:19:10.620,0:19:19.720
we not only resented me but that really

0:19:14.380,0:19:20.800
didn't like me as a person and I just

0:19:19.720,0:19:23.130
don't think that you like the person

0:19:20.800,0:19:28.330
that I was and I think that's also when

0:19:23.130,0:19:33.190
we probably had most of our discord and

0:19:28.330,0:19:34.420
the problems in our relationship I think

0:19:33.190,0:19:36.880
it was probably our worst point

0:19:34.420,0:19:40.420
especially the last like five years or

0:19:36.880,0:19:42.490
so there I think that you've resented

0:19:40.420,0:19:45.820
the amount of time I spent there how

0:19:42.490,0:19:47.980
much more I cared or appear to care

0:19:45.820,0:19:50.200
about well I don't think I wouldn't

0:19:47.980,0:19:52.810
advise that you resented the amount of

0:19:50.200,0:19:56.260
time you were giving that as opposed to

0:19:52.810,0:19:59.920
us because I felt like you were just

0:19:56.260,0:20:02.740
killing yourself with no reason for so

0:19:59.920,0:20:04.840
long you see why I would take away oh

0:20:02.740,0:20:05.990
absolutely absolutely

0:20:04.840,0:20:13.450
it's reason

0:20:05.990,0:20:13.450
still swimmin you what story Zeppelin

0:20:19.540,0:20:31.220
when do I hurt you when I'm trying to

0:20:28.790,0:20:35.110
lead you down the right path and you

0:20:31.220,0:20:39.100
just won't listen

0:20:35.110,0:20:39.100
and you know what I'm talking about

0:20:39.309,0:20:45.520
do you know exactly what I'm talking

0:20:41.300,0:20:49.640
about when I'm Quillan hurting myself I

0:20:45.520,0:20:52.220
try to just really back in if I can and

0:20:49.640,0:20:54.860
when you just don't even give me the

0:20:52.220,0:21:01.340
chance to explain their hurts me at

0:20:54.860,0:21:05.590
times but most of the time when I'm at

0:21:01.340,0:21:05.590
like to Adam thinking of you

0:21:13.750,0:21:25.220
list the top three best memories from

0:21:16.070,0:21:38.300
our relationship top three that's a long

0:21:25.220,0:21:41.990
time time you coming in Vinod pneumonia

0:21:38.300,0:21:51.410
and showing up with like the saddest

0:21:41.990,0:21:56.480
plastic bottle of watching the craft for

0:21:51.410,0:21:58.190
like 599 times and just hanging out with

0:21:56.480,0:22:03.110
me because I was so sick I would

0:21:58.190,0:22:10.190
definitely and we weren't even having

0:22:03.110,0:22:12.770
sex at that point you know but I'd say

0:22:10.190,0:22:16.130
that's definitely one and another one is

0:22:12.770,0:22:18.680
not necessarily a particular time but

0:22:16.130,0:22:20.930
and even though there's a picture of it

0:22:18.680,0:22:23.600
it's like a snapshot always in my head

0:22:20.930,0:22:25.610
and it's right there when we got married

0:22:23.600,0:22:34.610
and we had busted out all the glow

0:22:25.610,0:22:37.850
necklaces and it looks like just like

0:22:34.610,0:22:39.680
the one I even like you know just like

0:22:37.850,0:22:41.810
zoom in around a circle you were just

0:22:39.680,0:22:44.350
like you were having such a great time

0:22:41.810,0:22:50.290
it was like you were at your own rave oh

0:22:44.350,0:22:53.780
that is definitely up there and

0:22:50.290,0:22:53.780
[Music]

0:22:53.790,0:23:02.700
the tops it's not okay number of all

0:23:00.810,0:23:05.520
it's not like you know like it would

0:23:02.700,0:23:10.890
depend I would think like you know it

0:23:05.520,0:23:12.780
would probably be when we were on the

0:23:10.890,0:23:15.780
jet skis in Myrtle Beach

0:23:12.780,0:23:19.710
and seeing the dolphins and stuff you

0:23:15.780,0:23:24.270
know like you know like I'd say more so

0:23:19.710,0:23:27.840
than the squishy dolphin moment was the

0:23:24.270,0:23:33.240
air jaws moment when I nearly broke my

0:23:27.840,0:23:36.180
ass I'd say that guy in particular that

0:23:33.240,0:23:39.660
was a that was a great day that really

0:23:36.180,0:23:43.260
was what we do is baby you know it's

0:23:39.660,0:23:46.560
hard to think I'm just doing who what do

0:23:43.260,0:23:58.500
we care for me it's it's not about the

0:23:46.560,0:24:00.510
day it's about a moment like for me it's

0:23:58.500,0:24:02.940
like when I get to just see pure joy on

0:24:00.510,0:24:05.940
your face like just only two years ago

0:24:02.940,0:24:07.320
one of my favorite moments with you was

0:24:05.940,0:24:11.130
the first time we went fishing together

0:24:07.320,0:24:15.780
you would never look see I have never

0:24:11.130,0:24:17.730
seen you smile so hard and you know

0:24:15.780,0:24:20.340
that's just a woman it was just an

0:24:17.730,0:24:22.710
amazing day that wasn't about the entire

0:24:20.340,0:24:24.980
day it was about just looking at you at

0:24:22.710,0:24:24.980
that moment

0:24:37.520,0:24:57.750
I'll take it hard it's it's nice it's

0:24:42.540,0:25:06.090
nice how do you feel that I always rope

0:24:57.750,0:25:10.250
you in to stuff like this like I just do

0:25:06.090,0:25:12.660
you ever feel that sometimes my

0:25:10.250,0:25:15.990
adventurous side in terms of just doing

0:25:12.660,0:25:20.730
something that we would never do does

0:25:15.990,0:25:22.590
that every irritate you that more

0:25:20.730,0:25:27.390
free-spirited than you are in that way

0:25:22.590,0:25:29.160
no I'll take it rotates me at all I kind

0:25:27.390,0:25:31.170
of enjoy it actually because you're like

0:25:29.160,0:25:33.540
crazy right you'd never know what's

0:25:31.170,0:25:35.040
gonna happen you know there's that one

0:25:33.540,0:25:42.540
day we're sitting the concept you know

0:25:35.040,0:25:44.790
hey you're not having a sex no but what

0:25:42.540,0:25:45.330
I mean is it's never done it's never

0:25:44.790,0:25:47.520
done

0:25:45.330,0:25:48.690
well one day you're you're making

0:25:47.520,0:25:51.540
pickles your next day today we're gonna

0:25:48.690,0:25:55.050
go shoot this video all right sure

0:25:51.540,0:25:58.970
whatever you're going on game or can't

0:25:55.050,0:25:58.970
really suck that bad right here

0:26:06.650,0:26:15.140
have you ever wanted to live anywhere

0:26:10.080,0:26:17.190
outside of New York like in terms of

0:26:15.140,0:26:21.570
could you picture yourself living

0:26:17.190,0:26:24.900
anywhere outside of the five boroughs or

0:26:21.570,0:26:30.960
even outside of Manhattan Brooklyn she

0:26:24.900,0:26:33.390
this point in the moment now or just in

0:26:30.960,0:26:35.910
general like there are times that I just

0:26:33.390,0:26:39.720
think that I don't I don't feel that I

0:26:35.910,0:26:42.180
would be comfortable in my own skin

0:26:39.720,0:26:43.920
anywhere else I don't know if it's from

0:26:42.180,0:26:49.860
and I don't know if I wouldn't feel

0:26:43.920,0:26:55.260
accepted I think that there's a certain

0:26:49.860,0:26:59.730
amount of leeway that living here gives

0:26:55.260,0:27:04.590
you it's a sort of feel you're eccentric

0:26:59.730,0:27:06.030
yes you know what I mean like I don't

0:27:04.590,0:27:09.570
think I'd be able to be like this in

0:27:06.030,0:27:12.810
Boone Iowa or like you know everybody is

0:27:09.570,0:27:14.700
not extremely having this that's what I

0:27:12.810,0:27:16.890
mean like even though I have family in

0:27:14.700,0:27:18.180
the Midwest and even though I have

0:27:16.890,0:27:21.260
family scattered all over the place

0:27:18.180,0:27:27.420
really have never pictured myself living

0:27:21.260,0:27:30.120
truly anywhere else ever I found will I

0:27:27.420,0:27:31.830
like to or yeah just for us in the

0:27:30.120,0:27:34.560
future or is it something that you can

0:27:31.830,0:27:38.520
see yeah I mean absolutely right now

0:27:34.560,0:27:42.600
though the way things are and I haven't

0:27:38.520,0:27:44.580
have security here right now but in the

0:27:42.600,0:27:49.090
near future you know nearer to I like to

0:27:44.580,0:27:51.000
move yeah absolutely

0:27:49.090,0:27:54.230
[Music]

0:27:51.000,0:27:54.230
some place definitely morning

0:27:56.560,0:28:00.880
oh I feel like I should be asking more

0:28:00.370,0:28:05.380
questions

0:28:00.880,0:28:07.900
hmm is there anything that you wanted to

0:28:05.380,0:28:15.670
ask that now I'm on the spot

0:28:07.900,0:28:19.330
hmm yeah actually there do you think if

0:28:15.670,0:28:26.350
your mother was still here we would

0:28:19.330,0:28:30.630
still be one family you don't have to

0:28:26.350,0:28:41.200
answer because I miss it I miss

0:28:30.630,0:28:47.770

0:28:41.200,0:28:52.480
uh mommy kept us together she's the only

0:28:47.770,0:29:01.230
mother I had and family and part of the

0:28:52.480,0:29:08.700
reason why we're is part is why were as

0:29:01.230,0:29:08.700
fragmented killer yeah it's because she

0:29:10.630,0:29:21.700
really help us together she was the rock

0:29:13.539,0:29:26.009
