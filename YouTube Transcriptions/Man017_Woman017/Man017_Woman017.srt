1
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:21,240
when you think about the first time we

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:31,080
met what do you remember I remember and

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:34,950
just being amazed at how kind your eyes

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,629
were like honestly it was just but I've

5
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,510
always kind of thing about that what

6
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:48,739
that was and then you know the fact that

7
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:51,000
you kept forgetting me obviously that's

8
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,520
from that day that's one of the things

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,340
that I just remember thinking that he

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:05,460
smiles with his eyes and there are the

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:10,979
kindest eyes I've ever seen you know you

12
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:13,159
know this guy what do you love about our

13
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,159
relationship

14
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:26,140
the fact that no matter what you're my

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:30,130
friend at the end of the day is we can

16
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,659
have good days bad days argue about

17
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:36,490
stupid stuff at the end of the day

18
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:41,140
you're my best friend I think that's

19
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:44,020
probably one of the most important

20
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,979
things to me it's the fact that you

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:58,270
truly are my friend you know you know

22
00:01:47,979 --> 00:02:03,970
just my fuck buddy I never sugarcoat

23
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:10,830
anything do you know it's actually kind

24
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,830
of fun when do you feel closest to me

25
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:30,040
I'd have to say when probably when

26
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:42,890
you've been there me most the lowest

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:45,800
points where mama died you'll have to

28
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:54,770
let you know I think that's enough when

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:59,590
I'm at my lowest gonna be anything but

30
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:02,030
what are you hesitant to tell me nothing

31
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,270
absolutely nothing I think that's bull

32
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,780
no you know every little thing about my

33
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,630
life

34
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,140
before and after there's nothing that

35
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,990
you pause before you tell me or anything

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,940
like that there are things that wait and

37
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,650
if I feel like if something's going to

38
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,580
hurt your feelings I will pause but I

39
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:25,430
mean I never hold anything from you

40
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:33,860
there's no point it's Jo you talking you

41
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:35,810
sleep oh do we have enough sex no this

42
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,300
is a question every guy asks no then

43
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,070
ninety nine so that honestly and every

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,520
guy does probably ask it every single

45
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,890
one of our friends does I do not put out

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,160
enough I can tell you that right now but

47
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:52,280
I will say that let me do it is quality

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,840
and you know honestly I don't really

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,380
know that many people that have been

50
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,060
together as long as we have better still

51
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,350
even having as much sex as we have town

52
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,640
we know people that haven't touched each

53
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,860
other in years well I kind of know this

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,360
answer who has more power in the

55
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,360
relationship you or me

56
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:19,250
next question everyone knows answer that

57
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:23,240
you know you do you know it's all about

58
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:27,200
you I think I like to think I'm in

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:36,770
charge from time to time built on your

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:38,210
neck hey turn the head great what

61
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,780
bothered you about being the sole income

62
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:47,660
provider well that's actually more your

63
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:52,430
question since I'm really not that's

64
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:55,220
more than your question to answer I know

65
00:04:52,430 --> 00:05:01,580
it makes me feel awkward and it makes me

66
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:04,280
feel then I'm not keeping up my end of

67
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,100
the bargain it's not exactly cheap I

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,870
live over here and stuff you know yeah

69
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:14,600
but I'll never understand what you think

70
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:19,130
like that because I've always had my own

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:23,390
job my own income been so completely

72
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:29,260
self-reliant that I took the past two

73
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:33,080
years have been really rough I mean I

74
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,970
really feel like I've lost part of my

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,880
identity

76
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:43,610
so not I got any the little strong more

77
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,860
like um know a little bit of the

78
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,080
security in who I was and who I am and

79
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,260
who I knew myself to be for so long and

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,460
especially because I was so in my career

81
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,160
the entire time that we've been together

82
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:04,430
that this is just a completely weird

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:07,220
misstep for me you know yeah everyone

84
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,360
has hard times and we're a couple so it

85
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:18,289
doesn't know

86
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:21,490
I know wow in the back of your mind are

87
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:21,490
you scared that I'll walk away

88
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:38,180
at times I think everyone thinks that I

89
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:39,610
haven't thought that but again a long

90
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,639
time ago

91
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:46,659
well we bid through I don't think it

92
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:52,219
anymore I did one time not anymore

93
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:55,159
my when things were tough back in the

94
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:59,059
day when I was let's be like barely

95
00:06:55,159 --> 00:07:03,129
working it was hard it was really really

96
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:06,729
hard because I always felt like I was

97
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:10,069
not living up to your expectations

98
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,949
sort of like the way I feel now but

99
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:29,059
we've both been there and we've gotten

100
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:31,249
through everything right oh this is very

101
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:34,130
end up with the sex questions you guys

102
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:36,999
am I the best sex you've ever had

103
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:42,379
[Laughter]

104
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:48,919
already no it's no so that's terrible

105
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:52,789
this is this is bad no no no to say I'm

106
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:57,529
gonna gather for a very long time no to

107
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:59,959
say that it's not that it's you're not

108
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:02,360
the best sex I've ever had

109
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,649
well no I mean we've been together for

110
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,229
almost 20 years

111
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:13,909
no no I know but it's just it's so

112
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:16,669
awkward for me it's no secret we can

113
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:22,459
just name it I know why it's it's the

114
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:25,339
kind of thing where no but the type of

115
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:26,990
sex that we have is a different type of

116
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:30,469
sex than I've ever had with anyone else

117
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,630
so to just randomly compare it one it's

118
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:34,430
apples and oranges is obnoxious at that

119
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,589
you know yeah it's all fruit it's all

120
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,880
straight sex granted this you know

121
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:44,300
different flavors

122
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,660
but it's it's a completely it's a

123
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:52,160
different scenario it's not like I can

124
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,889
equally wear a moment the other but I

125
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,839
don't talk to you about this I don't

126
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:59,480
think we really do talk about this in

127
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,029
all the time that very rare we very rare

128
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,370
yeah like yeah no so that was kinda

129
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:08,060
interesting yeah wow that's terrible no

130
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:16,029
it's it did you ever want children with

131
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:16,029
me yes I don't even have to hesitate yes

132
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,329
how do you feel we've grown apart

133
00:09:39,470 --> 00:10:01,640
I think the older that we are just we're

134
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:06,010
not as forgiving enough to write them in

135
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,930
the right words but I don't think that

136
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:13,550
we gave each other a lot of leeway with

137
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,950
certain subjects anymore like I'm not

138
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,930
gonna put up with you when you do

139
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,880
conservative Republican bullshit because

140
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,590
you know conservative Republican is

141
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,280
someone you say shit like that it really

142
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:27,650
drives me batshit and I won't put up

143
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,810
with any more and I tell you you know to

144
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:37,250
shut up I think in terms of stuff like

145
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:39,890
that but I don't think that we've really

146
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,530
grown apart in that way unless you are

147
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,230
saying like the whole sexually thing

148
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:49,000
which is again I just consider that

149
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:54,410
normal and I'm so that um you know I

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:06,830
don't felt like I'm 20 anymore I just we

151
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:09,100
you know what would you do if I cheated

152
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,100
on you

153
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:19,760
[Laughter]

154
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:23,900
something like honestly though I already

155
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:28,400
kind of know we can sort of go by this

156
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,030
one oh well this I would not be a happy

157
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,650
man

158
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:35,570
I just I just just because of the

159
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,630
history game one of those it's just not

160
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:41,800
something yeah don't you have to be

161
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,580
concerned about it I'm very into time

162
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,160
one who said before I start another no I

163
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,390
wouldn't do that

164
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,390
we both know each other better than that

165
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,500
what are you scared to tell me

166
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:18,490
when I fuck up bad I know it sounds old

167
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:22,690
or ridiculous but it's more it's more a

168
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:26,500
matter of it's not when I messed up so

169
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:29,230
much it's where I do something or I

170
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,730
don't do something or I procrastinate

171
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,940
about something to the point where I

172
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:38,890
think you're going to be disappointed in

173
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:40,230
me it's almost like I don't want to

174
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,720
disappoint you

175
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,900
you don't I mean it's not so it's not

176
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,470
like you know like be afraid to tell you

177
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,670
something it's just you know like going

178
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,930
out and drinking too much wine and

179
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,290
falling asleep in the cab on the way

180
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,850
home and losing my phone you know like

181
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,110
the same shit everybody does except you

182
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,840
know they did it fifteen years younger I

183
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,760
mean stuff like that it's it's more I

184
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,460
don't want to disappoint you and I don't

185
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:19,050
want to embarrass myself by being

186
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:19,050
immature but I kind of feel like no no

187
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,860
fuck it sometimes I'm gonna disappoint

188
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,530
you but you love me anyway

189
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:31,180
okay so it's not really like there's

190
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:37,650
nothing really that I'd be like afraid

191
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,650
talking about but hmm

192
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:41,899
do you feel like we've lived up to the

193
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:49,489
dreams we had when we started this

194
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:53,350
relationship why or why not I don't

195
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:53,350
think we've lived up to our potential

196
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,859
because well it's good to have you give

197
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:07,069
me a moment there's just been so many

198
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:10,579
things I've happened along the way with

199
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:15,109
family and everything and loss of jobs

200
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:19,489
and it's just it's hard sometimes when

201
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:30,230
it when you I thought by this time we we

202
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:35,829
don't know already it's just sometimes

203
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,829
just talking I think that's probably I

204
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:45,110
never really wanted the house no I never

205
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:48,319
would even even like I didn't want to

206
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:52,639
watch it but you know to have a space of

207
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:57,410
do you and I have a family you know be

208
00:14:52,639 --> 00:15:01,129
like Auntie Mame you know like all that

209
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:05,529
I really wanted but it hasn't worked out

210
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:05,529
like that well it's it's not over yet

211
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:20,860
see your truth of mine I actually don't

212
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:22,389
go just go with us man was the biggest

213
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,899
compromise you've made I haven't

214
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,899
acknowledged

215
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:50,490
I don't think that don't think go into

216
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:56,310
that huh I just I don't think it's

217
00:15:50,490 --> 00:16:02,610
anything that you haven't acknowledged

218
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:07,040
per se without delving into more of it I

219
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:13,649
think it's more you don't take it as

220
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:18,680
serious as I think I don't think you

221
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:18,680
realize how much it affects me

222
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:38,450
why do you love me I honestly I can't

223
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:44,260
even narrow that down why I I just don't

224
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:49,640
I can't have anything everything

225
00:16:44,260 --> 00:17:04,819
everything that makes you you this corny

226
00:16:49,640 --> 00:17:06,079
Sophie's that sounds it's just you what

227
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:12,949
do I do that detracts from our

228
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:14,569
relationship oh my god you become like

229
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:27,430
and eat your own boy and you have a

230
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:27,430
temper tantrum beg for Captain Crunch

231
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,020
because I left one sheet of paper towel

232
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,720
you're having an epic meltdown like I

233
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,560
was just like no you can't have the

234
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:53,120
boxes here fucking doing it like really

235
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:56,900
back Roy is probably that's up there

236
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:03,640
that's my hissy fits well and I mean

237
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,640
what is your question that might

238
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,850
in the time that we have shared together

239
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:20,700
do you have any resentment toward me

240
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:28,590
though see no I don't think that's true

241
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:28,590
why do you think that's true I think I

242
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:38,110
don't know so much now because you're in

243
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,610
a power position without sounding

244
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,230
amounts just I don't mean it like you

245
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:46,060
know like you mourn over me or anything

246
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:48,990
but relationship wise right now you're

247
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:57,970
in a power position and I think that

248
00:18:48,990 --> 00:19:01,120
when I was still VP company and I was

249
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:04,000
devoting so much time to my career and

250
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,650
something that was so outside of us and

251
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,620
outside of our relationship and our

252
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:14,380
lives together I think that part of you

253
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:19,720
we not only resented me but that really

254
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,800
didn't like me as a person and I just

255
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,130
don't think that you like the person

256
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:28,330
that I was and I think that's also when

257
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:33,190
we probably had most of our discord and

258
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:34,420
the problems in our relationship I think

259
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,880
it was probably our worst point

260
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:40,420
especially the last like five years or

261
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,490
so there I think that you've resented

262
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,820
the amount of time I spent there how

263
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,980
much more I cared or appear to care

264
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,200
about well I don't think I wouldn't

265
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,810
advise that you resented the amount of

266
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,260
time you were giving that as opposed to

267
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:59,920
us because I felt like you were just

268
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:02,740
killing yourself with no reason for so

269
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,840
long you see why I would take away oh

270
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,990
absolutely absolutely

271
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:13,450
it's reason

272
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:13,450
still swimmin you what story Zeppelin

273
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:31,220
when do I hurt you when I'm trying to

274
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:35,110
lead you down the right path and you

275
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:39,100
just won't listen

276
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,100
and you know what I'm talking about

277
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:45,520
do you know exactly what I'm talking

278
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:49,640
about when I'm Quillan hurting myself I

279
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,220
try to just really back in if I can and

280
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,860
when you just don't even give me the

281
00:20:52,220 --> 00:21:01,340
chance to explain their hurts me at

282
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:05,590
times but most of the time when I'm at

283
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,590
like to Adam thinking of you

284
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:25,220
list the top three best memories from

285
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:38,300
our relationship top three that's a long

286
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:41,990
time time you coming in Vinod pneumonia

287
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:51,410
and showing up with like the saddest

288
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:56,480
plastic bottle of watching the craft for

289
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:58,190
like 599 times and just hanging out with

290
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,110
me because I was so sick I would

291
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:10,190
definitely and we weren't even having

292
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:12,770
sex at that point you know but I'd say

293
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:16,130
that's definitely one and another one is

294
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:18,680
not necessarily a particular time but

295
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,930
and even though there's a picture of it

296
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,600
it's like a snapshot always in my head

297
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,610
and it's right there when we got married

298
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:34,610
and we had busted out all the glow

299
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:37,850
necklaces and it looks like just like

300
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,680
the one I even like you know just like

301
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,810
zoom in around a circle you were just

302
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,350
like you were having such a great time

303
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:50,290
it was like you were at your own rave oh

304
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:53,780
that is definitely up there and

305
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,780
[Music]

306
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:02,700
the tops it's not okay number of all

307
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,520
it's not like you know like it would

308
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:10,890
depend I would think like you know it

309
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,780
would probably be when we were on the

310
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,780
jet skis in Myrtle Beach

311
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:19,710
and seeing the dolphins and stuff you

312
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:24,270
know like you know like I'd say more so

313
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:27,840
than the squishy dolphin moment was the

314
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:33,240
air jaws moment when I nearly broke my

315
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:36,180
ass I'd say that guy in particular that

316
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,660
was a that was a great day that really

317
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:43,260
was what we do is baby you know it's

318
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:46,560
hard to think I'm just doing who what do

319
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:58,500
we care for me it's it's not about the

320
00:23:46,560 --> 00:24:00,510
day it's about a moment like for me it's

321
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,940
like when I get to just see pure joy on

322
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,940
your face like just only two years ago

323
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,320
one of my favorite moments with you was

324
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,130
the first time we went fishing together

325
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:15,780
you would never look see I have never

326
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:17,730
seen you smile so hard and you know

327
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,340
that's just a woman it was just an

328
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,710
amazing day that wasn't about the entire

329
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,980
day it was about just looking at you at

330
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,980
that moment

331
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:57,750
I'll take it hard it's it's nice it's

332
00:24:42,540 --> 00:25:06,090
nice how do you feel that I always rope

333
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:10,250
you in to stuff like this like I just do

334
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:12,660
you ever feel that sometimes my

335
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,990
adventurous side in terms of just doing

336
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:20,730
something that we would never do does

337
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:22,590
that every irritate you that more

338
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:27,390
free-spirited than you are in that way

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:29,160
no I'll take it rotates me at all I kind

really suck that bad right here

352
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:15,140
have you ever wanted to live anywhere

353
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,190
outside of New York like in terms of

354
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,570
could you picture yourself living

355
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:24,900
anywhere outside of the five boroughs or

356
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:30,960
even outside of Manhattan Brooklyn she

357
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:33,390
this point in the moment now or just in

358
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,910
general like there are times that I just

359
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:39,720
think that I don't I don't feel that I

360
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:42,180
would be comfortable in my own skin

361
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,920
anywhere else I don't know if it's from

362
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:49,860
and I don't know if I wouldn't feel

363
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:55,260
accepted I think that there's a certain

364
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:59,730
amount of leeway that living here gives

365
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:04,590
you it's a sort of feel you're eccentric

366
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:06,030
yes you know what I mean like I don't

367
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,570
think I'd be able to be like this in

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:12,810
Boone Iowa or like you know everybody is

369
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,700

370
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,890
mean like even though I have family in

371
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,180
the Midwest and even though I have

372
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,260
family scattered all over the place

373
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:27,420
really have never pictured myself living

374
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:30,120
truly anywhere else ever I found will I

375
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,830
