0:00:17.840,0:00:31.679
hey ready ready oh you're gonna why do

0:00:25.590,0:00:37.860
you love me yeah Oh everyday why do you

0:00:31.679,0:00:39.960
love me I think well I loved you

0:00:37.860,0:00:42.180
probably before you actually loved me I

0:00:39.960,0:00:43.860
think the way that I love you now I

0:00:42.180,0:00:49.769
think I definitely loved you before you

0:00:43.860,0:00:52.170
laugh but I think I loved or love how

0:00:49.769,0:00:54.059
passionate you are like that's like the

0:00:52.170,0:00:56.250
first thing that I was like so attracted

0:00:54.059,0:00:58.199
to so I just love your passion just for

0:00:56.250,0:01:00.299
life and for your relationship with God

0:00:58.199,0:01:11.369
and all those things and because God

0:01:00.299,0:01:15.150
told me to I don't use your choice think

0:01:11.369,0:01:20.360
about this well I mean that's like the

0:01:15.150,0:01:20.360
main reasons because you're a good man

0:01:39.250,0:01:52.520
so I asked for my pals yes that looks

0:01:50.479,0:01:53.000
like you were writing I know that's so

0:01:52.520,0:01:58.640
weird

0:01:53.000,0:01:59.890
who are these yeah yeah a little less

0:01:58.640,0:02:02.479
legible

0:01:59.890,0:02:07.700
how about legit looks exactly like your

0:02:02.479,0:02:08.660
writing that's very bad not bad look

0:02:07.700,0:02:11.840
it's never a fault

0:02:08.660,0:02:13.250
like we read it what I'm not I grew up

0:02:11.840,0:02:21.580
in a generation we not to write anything

0:02:13.250,0:02:21.580
I wish they taught us calligraphy is a

0:02:24.880,0:02:32.060
perfect okay so when was the moment you

0:02:27.980,0:02:33.160
knew you loved me well this is

0:02:32.060,0:02:36.980
interesting

0:02:33.160,0:02:38.480
because I think if I were now looking

0:02:36.980,0:02:43.510
back because I can say it would be now a

0:02:38.480,0:02:47.180
lot more but I think I knew I loved you

0:02:43.510,0:02:50.209
when we started hanging out like my

0:02:47.180,0:02:53.510
first friends but I just had a cannon so

0:02:50.209,0:02:55.670
much like other shit and overlapping

0:02:53.510,0:02:57.260
things in my life look like total

0:02:55.670,0:02:59.660
insecurities and things were obvious I'm

0:02:57.260,0:03:04.459
not ignoring it and then eventually

0:02:59.660,0:03:06.709
sabotage it so I knew I mean if I was

0:03:04.459,0:03:08.450
just like not at that I'm just gonna be

0:03:06.709,0:03:10.850
like you're my buddy this is a great no

0:03:08.450,0:03:13.730
problem you know and then the moment we

0:03:10.850,0:03:16.430
started like dating and getting close I

0:03:13.730,0:03:18.079
was just like trying to like put it in

0:03:16.430,0:03:21.670
like a little compartment because I was

0:03:18.079,0:03:21.670
like I knew it was like

0:03:22.720,0:04:00.400
you know yes I was not I was not like

0:03:39.790,0:04:00.400
bullshitting myself I was like oh okay

0:04:00.640,0:04:09.730
yeah so it was like you know you know

0:04:39.820,0:04:49.690
are you directing this map that's okay

0:04:45.700,0:04:53.240
describe your first impression of me

0:04:49.690,0:05:02.960
well let's see my first impression of

0:04:53.240,0:05:06.070
you you're obviously dating Lauren okay

0:05:02.960,0:05:08.180
well you were dating my best friend and

0:05:06.070,0:05:11.150
we were really young and I just

0:05:08.180,0:05:14.560
remembered you were really really like

0:05:11.150,0:05:16.610
funny and just full of energy and so

0:05:14.560,0:05:18.410
naturally everyone's attracted to that

0:05:16.610,0:05:21.139
type of personality so that was my first

0:05:18.410,0:05:23.690
impression just kind of like he's so fun

0:05:21.139,0:05:25.580
and he's like so cool I always thought

0:05:23.690,0:05:28.169
you were like so cool I was like he's

0:05:25.580,0:05:32.470
like so cool yet cool friends

0:05:28.169,0:05:34.410
so like I read what I was like 15 that

0:05:32.470,0:05:36.850
was technically for a suggestion

0:05:34.410,0:05:39.580
and then there was like another first

0:05:36.850,0:05:43.479
impression later wouldn't there be well

0:05:39.580,0:05:45.750
but that's my first impression that's

0:05:43.479,0:05:45.750
cool

0:05:48.070,0:05:55.900
what what's your three favorite memories

0:05:51.610,0:05:57.880
that we've shared mm-hmm

0:05:55.900,0:06:04.350
should we wait for that plane since

0:05:57.880,0:06:06.850
there's like an airport right here hmm

0:06:04.350,0:06:09.000
that's actually hard to choose in a good

0:06:06.850,0:06:09.000
way

0:06:10.350,0:06:14.410
the first one that comes to my mind I

0:06:12.850,0:06:17.889
might like go out of order

0:06:14.410,0:06:20.530
chronologically it's like our first like

0:06:17.889,0:06:21.760
turnaround trip to California when you

0:06:20.530,0:06:23.979
got hired at done here and that was your

0:06:21.760,0:06:26.100
first job there buddy to LA and a high

0:06:23.979,0:06:29.560
audition for the voice and made it

0:06:26.100,0:06:31.750
season three and then we came right back

0:06:29.560,0:06:34.240
Oh week week or so later but that was

0:06:31.750,0:06:35.889
like Taniya I was like that was a really

0:06:34.240,0:06:37.389
strong memory I'm just like cuz it was

0:06:35.889,0:06:39.099
like the start of like so much other

0:06:37.389,0:06:47.500
stuff you know especially now I'm living

0:06:39.099,0:06:49.030
here over couple years let's see I think

0:06:47.500,0:06:52.180
that when we first started dating I

0:06:49.030,0:06:55.720
remember when a very strong memory it

0:06:52.180,0:06:58.360
was just like those it was like wine bar

0:06:55.720,0:06:59.260
that we first like and I was connected

0:06:58.360,0:07:04.270
no one to sorry

0:06:59.260,0:07:05.710
oh no no La Paloma it was more that La

0:07:04.270,0:07:07.870
Paloma was at the Starbucks

0:07:05.710,0:07:09.849
yeah we like I know unfortunately I was

0:07:07.870,0:07:10.990
better coffee but know when we first I

0:07:09.849,0:07:11.500
thought like hey let's have a business

0:07:10.990,0:07:13.539
meeting

0:07:11.500,0:07:15.820
and you shared all this really dope shit

0:07:13.539,0:07:17.710
about like your vision for I was like

0:07:15.820,0:07:20.620
that I think that's when I was first

0:07:17.710,0:07:22.090
oh my god this is crazy like because you

0:07:20.620,0:07:25.440
shared all this come credible like

0:07:22.090,0:07:28.509
vision about like your beauty stuff and

0:07:25.440,0:07:31.600
and I was like really like now I was

0:07:28.509,0:07:33.340
like now you're like going because like

0:07:31.600,0:07:35.949
really pumped because it's like about

0:07:33.340,0:07:37.870
entrepreneurship stuff like all of your

0:07:35.949,0:07:39.550
huge vision for like now you like

0:07:37.870,0:07:41.110
surpassed all that stuff already anyways

0:07:39.550,0:07:43.590
for the most not really other than like

0:07:41.110,0:07:46.870
the cool coloring book ideas really

0:07:43.590,0:07:51.900
perfect yeah but like all that stuff I

0:07:46.870,0:07:51.900
remember that was really strong I think

0:07:52.979,0:08:01.750
an obvious like oh we can go this fast

0:07:56.680,0:08:04.330
Tuesday when I proposed to you and you

0:08:01.750,0:08:10.720
said yes to becoming my wife that's

0:08:04.330,0:08:12.039
pretty good that's my favorite you got

0:08:10.720,0:08:14.860
me you shocked me

0:08:12.039,0:08:18.300
I was that good one my turn that's right

0:08:14.860,0:08:18.300
no no no it's yours actually is it yeah

0:08:20.849,0:08:29.820
this is fun

0:08:22.919,0:08:33.130
when do you feel closest to me I think

0:08:29.820,0:08:36.150
that's a good question I think I feel

0:08:33.130,0:08:38.740
closest when and this could be an

0:08:36.150,0:08:41.709
interesting thing but like the first

0:08:38.740,0:08:44.050
thing that came to mind was when we

0:08:41.709,0:08:48.700
might be disagreeing on something but

0:08:44.050,0:08:50.740
you kind of I'm able to communicate with

0:08:48.700,0:08:54.000
you in a way that you understand and

0:08:50.740,0:08:56.230
then you not necessarily compromise but

0:08:54.000,0:08:57.820
you're just really sensitive and like

0:08:56.230,0:08:59.800
understanding about it and I feel just

0:08:57.820,0:09:01.390
like I'll thank God you know what I mean

0:08:59.800,0:09:04.150
so I feel like really close when you're

0:09:01.390,0:09:07.779
just like understanding whether or not

0:09:04.150,0:09:09.459
maybe you agree or something like that

0:09:07.779,0:09:11.920
but you're just kind of like okay honey

0:09:09.459,0:09:13.630
like data and I'm maybe that can be

0:09:11.920,0:09:14.950
reciprocal but I feel like really close

0:09:13.630,0:09:16.570
to you at that point something yes it's

0:09:14.950,0:09:19.089
a win all right

0:09:16.570,0:09:20.680
right why does it feel like a win well

0:09:19.089,0:09:25.149
just that's cool that's good to know I'm

0:09:20.680,0:09:26.680
like oh yeah take that I got it and we

0:09:25.149,0:09:28.829
got a camera in case I forget it like

0:09:26.680,0:09:28.829
said

0:09:29.670,0:09:33.550
just because I feel like I mean

0:09:31.839,0:09:35.440
obviously in any relationship the

0:09:33.550,0:09:37.300
hardest thing is communication between a

0:09:35.440,0:09:40.060
male and a female and just understanding

0:09:37.300,0:09:42.070
each other and what kind of things are

0:09:40.060,0:09:44.139
extremely upsetting to me that maybe

0:09:42.070,0:09:46.360
aren't upsetting to you but for you to

0:09:44.139,0:09:48.009
just step back and go okay this doesn't

0:09:46.360,0:09:52.000
really make sense to me but like I'm

0:09:48.009,0:09:54.300
going to I guess yeah maybe the word is

0:09:52.000,0:09:57.819
compromised and just understand that

0:09:54.300,0:09:59.410
it's not about like you know I don't

0:09:57.819,0:10:03.910
have to understand and the fact that you

0:09:59.410,0:10:05.290
just kind of let it I don't know I don't

0:10:03.910,0:10:06.639
explain it but you know I mean like when

0:10:05.290,0:10:09.430
we just kind of come to some sort of

0:10:06.639,0:10:11.529
resolve yeah I'm still wearing that well

0:10:09.430,0:10:14.500
we both are yeah but I think that that's

0:10:11.529,0:10:16.060
when and we're getting better and better

0:10:14.500,0:10:17.259
I thought which is great and I think

0:10:16.060,0:10:28.710
that that's and I feel closest cuz I'm

0:10:17.259,0:10:31.260
like we can do this yeah okay

0:10:28.710,0:10:32.960
what do you think is the hardest thing

0:10:31.260,0:10:36.300
for me right now

0:10:32.960,0:10:38.430
that's big what do you think the hardest

0:10:36.300,0:10:41.820
thing for me what do you think is the

0:10:38.430,0:10:49.260
hardest thing for me right now mm-hmm

0:10:41.820,0:10:51.540
I guess it's like let's see I think that

0:10:49.260,0:10:55.860
well I guess there's a few different

0:10:51.540,0:10:59.750
things that's like a let's see what do

0:10:55.860,0:10:59.750
you think that means to you though no no

0:11:00.680,0:11:07.050
I think practically

0:11:03.270,0:11:08.880
you know like obviously right now where

0:11:07.050,0:11:11.730
things are at like there's so much great

0:11:08.880,0:11:13.740
stuff that we've been building and

0:11:11.730,0:11:16.529
obviously like and I knew it was the

0:11:13.740,0:11:17.970
right thing like to get engaged

0:11:16.529,0:11:19.140
obviously we both feel like a strong

0:11:17.970,0:11:21.770
sense of peace for that but I think

0:11:19.140,0:11:23.370
what's probably hard is fully like

0:11:21.770,0:11:24.899
trusting the process because not

0:11:23.370,0:11:27.510
everything's like in order you know

0:11:24.899,0:11:29.220
right now I'm learning to trust more and

0:11:27.510,0:11:33.980
more than me probably he's really hard

0:11:29.220,0:11:36.360
and more and more and you know God and

0:11:33.980,0:11:39.000
he's leading us to which can seem really

0:11:36.360,0:11:43.470
really psychotic at times and really

0:11:39.000,0:11:46.260
unreliable and like completely the exact

0:11:43.470,0:11:51.089
opposite of like what most stable people

0:11:46.260,0:11:53.880
would do and insane people would do yeah

0:11:51.089,0:11:57.330
I bet you that's hard being with an

0:11:53.880,0:11:59.250
insane person but like you know I can

0:11:57.330,0:12:01.200
imagine no I wear that sometimes I'm

0:11:59.250,0:12:03.089
sure I do I wear that sometimes I'm

0:12:01.200,0:12:06.240
thinking like wow that's got to be so

0:12:03.089,0:12:10.110
hard for her because I don't know me and

0:12:06.240,0:12:12.060
obviously I you know me but you know I

0:12:10.110,0:12:14.190
always worry about that like being

0:12:12.060,0:12:16.860
difficult to be like me I can probably

0:12:14.190,0:12:19.350
have the worst I can have like this and

0:12:16.860,0:12:21.329
that that and I think even in your your

0:12:19.350,0:12:23.139
own self to you

0:12:21.329,0:12:25.239
entrepreneurial goals and your own

0:12:23.139,0:12:28.449
career goals and life goals and things

0:12:25.239,0:12:30.100
like that so the gap between like it

0:12:28.449,0:12:32.439
feeling like it's really really close

0:12:30.100,0:13:00.489
and not a time especially like right

0:12:32.439,0:13:08.249
right now specifically the director of

0:13:00.489,0:13:10.709
the cards that's that makes sense um

0:13:08.249,0:13:24.419
started

0:13:10.709,0:13:27.699
what are you hesitant to tell me I think

0:13:24.419,0:13:30.730
like at this point I mean I think these

0:13:27.699,0:13:37.089
conversations kind of come up a little

0:13:30.730,0:13:40.720
bit but I get hesitant to imagine your

0:13:37.089,0:13:45.939
career as a musician blowing up just

0:13:40.720,0:13:48.119
because it's scary it's like there's

0:13:45.939,0:13:48.119
like

0:13:54.910,0:14:04.730
like all the things like because I know

0:14:00.770,0:14:09.860
the music is so good I love it but it's

0:14:04.730,0:14:12.200
just hard because I see like how just

0:14:09.860,0:14:15.950
these men just become like completely

0:14:12.200,0:14:18.290
like like sex and bulls in like they're

0:14:15.950,0:14:21.140
just like so the attention is all on

0:14:18.290,0:14:23.450
them and so I obviously just struggle

0:14:21.140,0:14:27.170
with so much insecurity as it is so -

0:14:23.450,0:14:31.430
like even think about all these eyes

0:14:27.170,0:14:35.210
like on you and just like mm-hmm that

0:14:31.430,0:14:37.880
lifestyle is just so tough so like for

0:14:35.210,0:14:41.780
us because we've like struggled past

0:14:37.880,0:14:43.400
with just like so much shit then it's

0:14:41.780,0:14:45.400
just scary to me and I know that like

0:14:43.400,0:14:49.820
our relationship is solid and like

0:14:45.400,0:14:51.920
obviously being engaged is helpful but

0:14:49.820,0:14:57.430
it still doesn't a gate the fact that

0:14:51.920,0:15:04.100
like I just get so worried that like I

0:14:57.430,0:15:05.990
don't know you know like I don't know

0:15:04.100,0:15:09.590
like that's it's just like so hard cuz I

0:15:05.990,0:15:12.710
want to be so supportive and I am but at

0:15:09.590,0:15:14.150
the same time it's like I get hesitate

0:15:12.710,0:15:17.000
cuz I'm like well yeah but what about my

0:15:14.150,0:15:18.890
career like I want my stuff to blow up

0:15:17.000,0:15:22.550
and like you have this whole energy like

0:15:18.890,0:15:25.610
around your team and and just like a lot

0:15:22.550,0:15:27.020
of our stuff parallels so much so then

0:15:25.610,0:15:30.440
it's like and we've kind of talked about

0:15:27.020,0:15:33.620
this but like just I just don't want to

0:15:30.440,0:15:36.320
be left in the dust of like your music

0:15:33.620,0:15:40.190
blowing up and then you just being like

0:15:36.320,0:15:42.650
oh yeah well I make youtube videos and I

0:15:40.190,0:15:44.120
know that financially if that does

0:15:42.650,0:15:46.700
happen for you cuz then I could just

0:15:44.120,0:15:49.310
like kind of do whatever I want and

0:15:46.700,0:15:54.260
produce shit like this which is what I

0:15:49.310,0:15:56.420
want but that's just like yeah scary

0:15:54.260,0:15:58.160
like all of it scary to me just other

0:15:56.420,0:16:00.920
girls and like all that shit like the

0:15:58.160,0:16:02.420
music industry is just so gross so

0:16:00.920,0:16:04.370
that's like thankfully like we're

0:16:02.420,0:16:06.910
Christians and like all that I know will

0:16:04.370,0:16:19.960
be different

0:16:06.910,0:16:19.960
it's just hard okay thank you

0:16:30.680,0:16:46.370
it turns out you won like it's just

0:16:43.730,0:16:48.170
gonna be shitty if like like you've

0:16:46.370,0:16:50.390
already seen how I get with like other

0:16:48.170,0:16:55.970
girls so like it's gonna be hell I feel

0:16:50.390,0:17:01.310
bad for that like if I see any I'm like

0:16:55.970,0:17:11.780
uh-uh don't even like freaking flip out

0:17:01.310,0:17:24.250
that's what I said I said no there's no

0:17:11.780,0:17:24.250
girls and I'm like that's not happening

0:17:27.370,0:17:32.680
what could I do to improve our

0:17:30.050,0:17:32.680
relationship

0:17:42.840,0:17:53.070
it's nice what could you what could I do

0:17:51.120,0:18:03.889
so what can you do what can I do what

0:17:53.070,0:18:06.330
can you do I think just in general like

0:18:03.889,0:18:12.659
I said to you before and it's obviously

0:18:06.330,0:18:14.129
like you know with not a sturdy past

0:18:12.659,0:18:16.169
that's pretty late to leaner and I

0:18:14.129,0:18:19.169
understand that but just like what I

0:18:16.169,0:18:21.269
know and like where I'm at like even

0:18:19.169,0:18:24.360
like in my heart and when I see for both

0:18:21.269,0:18:27.779
like I think what could really improve

0:18:24.360,0:18:29.460
our relationship and just you in general

0:18:27.779,0:18:31.259
would just be like I think just really

0:18:29.460,0:18:35.490
taking a chance to trust me more Milan

0:18:31.259,0:18:37.409
things and you know you have a you're a

0:18:35.490,0:18:38.909
strong woman you know and you have a lot

0:18:37.409,0:18:41.100
of tendencies to like do things on your

0:18:38.909,0:18:43.529
own and I think you're learning more to

0:18:41.100,0:18:45.119
like find the value in that and I just

0:18:43.529,0:18:49.200
think like the world would open up you

0:18:45.119,0:18:51.889
know in our relationship I think if

0:18:49.200,0:18:54.480
there was a deeper level of trust like

0:18:51.889,0:18:55.110
we continue to like explore you know

0:18:54.480,0:18:57.389
what I mean

0:18:55.110,0:18:59.610
and I want that I want that like full

0:18:57.389,0:19:01.590
confidence we just like you don't have

0:18:59.610,0:19:03.799
to like kick and scream sometimes and

0:19:01.590,0:19:03.799
like

0:19:05.120,0:19:11.029
because I'm like getting back of my head

0:19:07.860,0:19:11.029
I'm just like shaking my head to say

0:19:25.820,0:19:30.779
like seeking to understand you know

0:19:29.519,0:19:32.940
because that's a half of that I'm like

0:19:30.779,0:19:34.169
you understood and you could show me

0:19:32.940,0:19:36.389
that you can understand where I'm coming

0:19:34.169,0:19:38.309
from me you would see that I'm swimming

0:19:36.389,0:19:39.899
you know you can see that how i'm having

0:19:38.309,0:19:41.519
your best interest their heart more than

0:19:39.899,0:19:43.460
i think i get credit for but it's

0:19:41.519,0:19:46.230
changing that's the what i'm saying i'm

0:19:43.460,0:19:48.000
even recently i'm seeing like total

0:19:46.230,0:19:53.250
shifts who knew that that finger was

0:19:48.000,0:19:58.010
like the magic ring you know just in

0:19:53.250,0:19:58.010
general like allowing that space to like

0:20:08.870,0:20:21.480
right yes oh I guess the bottom of the

0:20:14.940,0:20:24.169
barrel is good I said am I the best sex

0:20:21.480,0:20:24.169
you've ever had

0:20:27.320,0:20:35.429
oh cool seriously no but my hey

0:20:32.429,0:20:42.840
background no no not like that but I

0:20:35.429,0:20:45.179
just mean like the answer is clearly you

0:20:42.840,0:20:47.570
remove me from the darks - I saw the

0:20:45.179,0:20:47.570
light

0:20:48.529,0:20:55.169
it's so embarrassing like that should be

0:20:51.570,0:20:58.260
like no you like you like helped out the

0:20:55.169,0:21:03.179
King where do you want to expand that no

0:20:58.260,0:21:06.360
okay well there you have it

0:21:03.179,0:21:12.899
when do you get jealous of me being with

0:21:06.360,0:21:14.310
others um I'm not as you know I'm not

0:21:12.899,0:21:16.890
like the jealous type

0:21:14.310,0:21:20.370
in general when I I'm really not maybe I

0:21:16.890,0:21:22.380
should be more sometimes no because um I

0:21:20.370,0:21:23.940
think there's times if I do get jealous

0:21:22.380,0:21:26.970
it's a number like time because I like

0:21:23.940,0:21:29.180
spending time with you and where I get

0:21:26.970,0:21:32.460
most jealous if it's like you know

0:21:29.180,0:21:35.070
something or someone or even if it's

0:21:32.460,0:21:36.840
like something you know stressful or

0:21:35.070,0:21:43.890
whatever that's like taking you away

0:21:36.840,0:21:47.730
from the lake sometimes anything makes

0:21:43.890,0:21:49.110
you feel like you can it's not

0:21:47.730,0:21:51.180
necessarily people I'm like I would

0:21:49.110,0:21:52.470
never worry about late if he went on

0:21:51.180,0:21:54.690
camera yeah that question probably

0:21:52.470,0:21:58.710
would've been better if it was for me

0:21:54.690,0:22:00.300
my and maybe yeah I don't really I guess

0:21:58.710,0:22:02.070
it's a good thing you know but I'm just

0:22:00.300,0:22:03.900
not like that anyways I might just get

0:22:02.070,0:22:06.060
jealous when I get sent on work trips to

0:22:03.900,0:22:08.970
Disney World in your case yeah that is

0:22:06.060,0:22:11.400
fair enough I'm just like that's dumb I

0:22:08.970,0:22:14.430
should go yeah for four days in Disney

0:22:11.400,0:22:27.300
World for work I definitely could be a

0:22:14.430,0:22:30.180
part of that I got yeah

0:22:27.300,0:22:35.520
do you know just ask one no I'm good at

0:22:30.180,0:22:38.760
this what's the biggest sacrifice you've

0:22:35.520,0:22:41.250
made that I haven't acknowledged that's

0:22:38.760,0:22:45.510
a good question the biggest sacrifice

0:22:41.250,0:22:47.970
that I've made that you haven't

0:22:45.510,0:22:50.840
acknowledged yeah what's the biggest

0:22:47.970,0:22:50.840
sacrifice you've made

0:22:56.280,0:23:10.320
I mean cuz I feel like I've definitely

0:23:07.290,0:23:13.920
made lots of sacrifices and that was

0:23:10.320,0:23:15.840
vice versa but I think that you do a

0:23:13.920,0:23:17.370
really good job of acknowledging it but

0:23:15.840,0:23:20.940
I'm trying to think of one that like I

0:23:17.370,0:23:23.270
feel like you have anything or maybe not

0:23:20.940,0:23:23.270
I know

0:23:39.360,0:23:42.870
I mean maybe I mean like this is like

0:23:41.430,0:23:45.270
kind of silly but like the thing that

0:23:42.870,0:23:50.640
comes to mind I mean like I think again

0:23:45.270,0:23:53.400
we'd like to discuss this but maybe like

0:23:50.640,0:23:55.370
a big sacrifice has been just having you

0:23:53.400,0:24:00.180
and Gracie you know sharing my space

0:23:55.370,0:24:03.930
which is your dog so having you and now

0:24:00.180,0:24:05.760
we have two dogs and two humans in my

0:24:03.930,0:24:07.710
room and obviously really sharing that

0:24:05.760,0:24:09.630
space right now and so I think that

0:24:07.710,0:24:11.100
that's I mean but you pretty much

0:24:09.630,0:24:14.640
acknowledge it for sure like we've

0:24:11.100,0:24:16.830
talked about this but I think because

0:24:14.640,0:24:18.450
like what I'd create is a lot of the

0:24:16.830,0:24:20.610
times from my room and so I think that's

0:24:18.450,0:24:24.240
just like so stressful to try and feel

0:24:20.610,0:24:26.400
inspired to like film in that space when

0:24:24.240,0:24:30.810
there's just not which I'm so glad we're

0:24:26.400,0:24:32.430
moving but I think that's like probably

0:24:30.810,0:24:34.500
one of the biggest sacrifices in the

0:24:32.430,0:24:52.350
last its I'd say like few months for

0:24:34.500,0:24:54.920
like year whatever but yeah this was on

0:24:52.350,0:24:56.730
the I wrote gonna see my penmanship yeah

0:24:54.920,0:25:00.260
it's a lot different than than

0:24:56.730,0:25:00.260
penmanship on these curtains I see

0:25:05.470,0:25:13.070
I mean something I don't know what is it

0:25:11.120,0:25:14.600
okay whatever just a secret that you

0:25:13.070,0:25:27.530
have been afraid to tell you yeah but

0:25:14.600,0:25:29.300
let's get juicier I know you're not

0:25:27.530,0:25:30.470
gonna tell me what I want to know like

0:25:29.300,0:25:31.970
so why don't you just ask me the

0:25:30.470,0:25:33.320
question I don't know like that's what

0:25:31.970,0:25:34.580
I'm saying it's obviously there's stuff

0:25:33.320,0:25:36.020
that I don't know so what is something

0:25:34.580,0:25:38.930
that you're like she doesn't need to

0:25:36.020,0:25:41.300
know that yeah I feel like I don't

0:25:38.930,0:25:43.490
really have any like secrets like we've

0:25:41.300,0:25:45.050
kind of already been there and covered

0:25:43.490,0:25:53.450
that stuff it's like I don't really like

0:25:45.050,0:25:54.740
keeping secrets if you were like ask me

0:25:53.450,0:25:57.050
like a point-blank question I could be

0:25:54.740,0:26:00.350
like okay okay then what's something

0:25:57.050,0:26:04.760
specifically in the last couple years

0:26:00.350,0:26:09.140
that you've never told me that you know

0:26:04.760,0:26:12.620
I would be upset about or you've been

0:26:09.140,0:26:15.790
like not telling me just because you're

0:26:12.620,0:26:18.980
trying to protect me being sad or that's

0:26:15.790,0:26:23.000
that's such a loaded question I'm like

0:26:18.980,0:26:24.200
getting myself like in trouble yeah I

0:26:23.000,0:26:26.300
mean like the only thing that comes to

0:26:24.200,0:26:29.780
my mind was like just all that the time

0:26:26.300,0:26:33.970
where I was like my taking time with

0:26:29.780,0:26:42.230
like the ex situation and I'm just like

0:26:33.970,0:26:44.950
brushing a lot of I just wanna dismiss

0:26:42.230,0:26:44.950
this from my life

0:26:59.980,0:27:05.059
yeah so I was like for me I was like

0:27:02.570,0:27:08.450
trying to think about that and at the

0:27:05.059,0:27:12.739
same time like knowing that really

0:27:08.450,0:27:15.679
knowing her like we had much more like

0:27:12.739,0:27:17.330
at stake was like put me in an

0:27:15.679,0:27:22.940
interesting position because it's like

0:27:17.330,0:27:23.570
all right like you know if it was like

0:27:22.940,0:27:25.249
okay

0:27:23.570,0:27:26.720
damned if I do damned if I don't you

0:27:25.249,0:27:28.730
know if I'm being authentic even if I

0:27:26.720,0:27:30.559
know that I know this is probably going

0:27:28.730,0:27:33.320
to like self cracked one way or another

0:27:30.559,0:27:34.820
and being authentic about that but also

0:27:33.320,0:27:37.940
being out and about like I knew in my

0:27:34.820,0:27:40.340
heart like it was gonna work itself out

0:27:37.940,0:27:42.909
like between you and I but it was just

0:27:40.340,0:27:48.649
like a really weird time so I like

0:27:42.909,0:27:57.200
obviously I'm smoothing over things

0:27:48.649,0:27:59.109
about your things like you know like

0:27:57.200,0:28:21.259
communication or hearing from her or

0:27:59.109,0:28:23.480
whatever okay yeah okay here you go

0:28:21.259,0:28:25.669
here's mine

0:28:23.480,0:28:28.009
there's my actually that's not Bannon

0:28:25.669,0:28:32.299
ready I think a nice pace yeah uh-oh

0:28:28.009,0:28:34.429
what is the question I said well this is

0:28:32.299,0:28:36.559
a my curiosity because obviously like

0:28:34.429,0:28:37.789
it's always been curious not you know

0:28:36.559,0:28:40.410
I've been supportive himself of like

0:28:37.789,0:28:41.910
you've dated girls for like a long time

0:28:40.410,0:28:44.640
for me and there's still certain things

0:28:41.910,0:28:47.100
that come up where I'm kind of curious

0:28:44.640,0:28:49.680
like okay what does that mean I don't

0:28:47.100,0:28:50.910
wait too that you know at all so my

0:28:49.680,0:28:53.190
curiosity this is a specific question

0:28:50.910,0:28:54.420
but over the past three years that we've

0:28:53.190,0:28:56.040
been dating on and off three plus years

0:28:54.420,0:28:59.100
that we've been dating on and off while

0:28:56.040,0:29:03.060
we were off did you date or what if you

0:28:59.100,0:29:06.090
know that once well maybe I mean I was

0:29:03.060,0:29:08.310
making once that was like maybe I don't

0:29:06.090,0:29:11.130
have divulge no I don't think so

0:29:08.310,0:29:15.060
I don't know wait a minute wait a minute

0:29:11.130,0:29:16.260
I like to remember no wait no but really

0:29:15.060,0:29:19.170
it was like nothing to be worried about

0:29:16.260,0:29:21.270
when was this a long time ago I was when

0:29:19.170,0:29:23.160
I was living in moral a drive house I

0:29:21.270,0:29:26.160
think I don't like have to think about

0:29:23.160,0:29:28.110
it just Megan you didn't kiss any other

0:29:26.160,0:29:30.590
girl but that's your next girlfriend

0:29:28.110,0:29:38.190
yeah but I was like not even oh come on

0:29:30.590,0:29:45.090
what's weird because it was like you're

0:29:38.190,0:29:47.600
not yeah but you are off really right so

0:29:45.090,0:29:56.000
you're entitled to a girlfriend because

0:29:47.600,0:29:56.000
it's a girl and so it's fine

0:29:56.520,0:30:01.350
no that's not how it works what happened

0:29:59.130,0:30:03.090
oh you did Wow like how long ago what's

0:30:01.350,0:30:05.280
a long time that could be like three

0:30:03.090,0:30:09.030
weeks or something out the longer no

0:30:05.280,0:30:12.600
like literally it was when we weren't

0:30:09.030,0:30:14.760
even living out here yet and you and I

0:30:12.600,0:30:16.220
were just starting to talk so he said

0:30:14.760,0:30:18.390
since we've been off and on

0:30:16.220,0:30:19.080
that's like the Marley Drive that

0:30:18.390,0:30:22.500
doesn't make sense

0:30:19.080,0:30:27.870
I don't remember I don't remember I

0:30:22.500,0:30:30.120
honestly I just remember I there's that

0:30:27.870,0:30:31.410
there's that weird nervous laugh no

0:30:30.120,0:30:34.530
really I'm like trying to piece it

0:30:31.410,0:30:36.540
together I I thought no I'm really I'm

0:30:34.530,0:30:39.540
not lying I swear to God I think it was

0:30:36.540,0:30:42.390
during the time when I came out here to

0:30:39.540,0:30:44.280
visit because I remember going it was

0:30:42.390,0:30:44.960
I'm getting confused because we also

0:30:44.280,0:30:46.100
hung out once

0:30:44.960,0:30:47.510
the Marley Drive house but it was not

0:30:46.100,0:30:50.960
even like that so I think it was

0:30:47.510,0:30:53.179
actually before I moved out here and I

0:30:50.960,0:30:56.710
was visiting for my birthday actually

0:30:53.179,0:31:05.330
it's weird you have such a detailed

0:30:56.710,0:31:07.750
specific memory I just say yeah no I

0:31:05.330,0:31:07.750
mean I would

0:31:09.730,0:31:13.640
I'm answering I think you don't know is

0:31:12.409,0:31:14.210
your verdict is because there was not a

0:31:13.640,0:31:18.919
big deal

0:31:14.210,0:31:20.659
oh that's how ass yeah I'm answering the

0:31:18.919,0:31:26.270
question so did you go on a date with a

0:31:20.659,0:31:29.000
girl yeah no they all asked still okay

0:31:26.270,0:31:30.440
know if anyone it was not female so you

0:31:29.000,0:31:35.179
would have to be worried about what you

0:31:30.440,0:31:37.399
knew that that's not anything like

0:31:35.179,0:31:38.330
honestly that's not what you should have

0:31:37.399,0:31:40.100
been worried about when we were not

0:31:38.330,0:31:42.140
together it was the other guys that I

0:31:40.100,0:31:43.789
was dating that's what I'm worried about

0:31:42.140,0:31:51.110
huh that's not what I was worried about

0:31:43.789,0:31:53.450
I know I don't know why okay that's was

0:31:51.110,0:31:55.250
curious me I would be a lot more concern

0:31:53.450,0:31:57.409
about guys which now is not a problem

0:31:55.250,0:31:58.760
but like I don't know why you put too

0:31:57.409,0:32:00.110
much focus on that kind of stuff cuz it

0:31:58.760,0:32:11.510
doesn't matter well it matters in

0:32:00.110,0:32:14.630
certain in certain moments I like still

0:32:11.510,0:32:15.890
like it still lingers a little bit as

0:32:14.630,0:32:17.179
far as like attracting the girls but

0:32:15.890,0:32:18.710
there's no action but it's still curious

0:32:17.179,0:32:21.620
I'm still curious about it because it's

0:32:18.710,0:32:23.510
still present in some way or another I'm

0:32:21.620,0:32:26.860
not like worried about it like as far as

0:32:23.510,0:32:26.860
if the relationship but it definitely

0:32:29.169,0:32:33.830
don't have like this like fluid

0:32:32.149,0:32:35.510
attraction and males are involved

0:32:33.830,0:32:37.539
females are involved and you're involved

0:32:35.510,0:32:41.059
you would be like what the fuck

0:32:37.539,0:32:42.440
what so I was out we I'm you're not

0:32:41.059,0:32:44.870
gonna get a what the fuck out of me

0:32:42.440,0:32:45.680
you're gonna get fill me fill in the

0:32:44.870,0:32:48.740
blanks

0:32:45.680,0:32:50.810
no question like you know empathize if

0:32:48.740,0:32:54.440
you either and I'm like I come left with

0:32:50.810,0:32:55.910
like all right you know and so in some

0:32:54.440,0:32:57.260
situations because I'm kind of like okay

0:32:55.910,0:32:58.580
I think I understand but then there's

0:32:57.260,0:32:59.990
like little curve balls that come where

0:32:58.580,0:33:01.520
I'm just like Kaylee fill in the blanks

0:32:59.990,0:33:04.130
you know Mike help me understand more

0:33:01.520,0:33:06.950
because I obviously can't relate to that

0:33:04.130,0:33:09.680
in a parallel way you know so it's like

0:33:06.950,0:33:11.600
that's why I wrote that question not

0:33:09.680,0:33:12.920
about me because I'm actually glad it's

0:33:11.600,0:33:15.620
about that cuz that's an easy answer

0:33:12.920,0:33:18.050
then questions about when you and I were

0:33:15.620,0:33:21.200
off and I was doing other people so I'm

0:33:18.050,0:33:22.400
glad that's one thing like that's not

0:33:21.200,0:33:24.740
even anything to be worrying about

0:33:22.400,0:33:25.910
okay so what should I worry nothing

0:33:24.740,0:33:29.930
that's a different question that you

0:33:25.910,0:33:32.060
didn't get and we were stuck no you

0:33:29.930,0:33:33.650
should be worried now I'm saying in the

0:33:32.060,0:33:35.270
past yeah there was a lot to be worried

0:33:33.650,0:33:36.920
would you share you just avoid you just

0:33:35.270,0:33:38.780
evaded my entire question and just

0:33:36.920,0:33:40.460
rerouted it to something that was it's

0:33:38.780,0:33:41.750
irrelevant to me in this question like I

0:33:40.460,0:33:44.030
asked you that for a reason you know

0:33:41.750,0:33:46.130
okay what is the question well yeah okay

0:33:44.030,0:33:49.520
so the answer's no have you been dating

0:33:46.130,0:33:50.930
on our did you go on a date and worry

0:33:49.520,0:33:52.190
physical with if you don't know we

0:33:50.930,0:33:53.450
technical answer's no that's saying like

0:33:52.190,0:33:56.540
even just recently there's been

0:33:53.450,0:33:58.160
conversations about like you and you're

0:33:56.540,0:33:59.600
attracting females and that's something

0:33:58.160,0:34:00.860
that's a concern to me like what you do

0:33:59.600,0:34:02.840
with what you choose to tell me about

0:34:00.860,0:34:04.310
the people you've dated other people you

0:34:02.840,0:34:07.570
told me about other people didn't talk

0:34:04.310,0:34:07.570
to you I mean you think it's relevant

0:34:07.750,0:34:10.790
I'm like to me that's something that's

0:34:10.370,0:34:12.710
curious

0:34:10.790,0:34:14.030
I'm genuinely curious about because I'm

0:34:12.710,0:34:15.220
like I don't understand it right well

0:34:14.030,0:34:19.610
that's a different question

0:34:15.220,0:34:21.410
okay okay that's not the question you're

0:34:19.610,0:34:24.050
asking the question the answer to that

0:34:21.410,0:34:26.030
is no okay but if you're asking a

0:34:24.050,0:34:30.260
different question of like should I be

0:34:26.030,0:34:33.320
concerned when we're married if you're

0:34:30.260,0:34:34.940
going to watch you know me with a girl

0:34:33.320,0:34:36.650
or something that's how it is

0:34:34.940,0:34:38.480
well then what's the question yeah I

0:34:36.650,0:34:40.790
mean if ever a spinoff of that question

0:34:38.480,0:34:42.380
will just be like explain that it's more

0:34:40.790,0:34:44.030
open than anything I'm not like saying

0:34:42.380,0:34:45.380
yes or no cuz yes or no it's easy it can

0:34:44.030,0:34:48.140
be like technically speaking no

0:34:45.380,0:34:49.560
technically speaking yes but the nuance

0:34:48.140,0:34:51.750
that's important it's a

0:34:49.560,0:34:54.540
like the details you know the tell us

0:34:51.750,0:34:56.790
the details and most things so it's like

0:34:54.540,0:34:57.930
if I'm seeking to understand you and

0:34:56.790,0:35:00.120
that's a part of you that seems very

0:34:57.930,0:35:02.100
like suppressed at times but they it

0:35:00.120,0:35:03.000
pops up in what's wrong but I'm okay

0:35:02.100,0:35:04.950
like whatever

0:35:03.000,0:35:07.710
you know I still curious about it it's

0:35:04.950,0:35:11.180
still a part of you you can't like fully

0:35:07.710,0:35:11.180
oh do we need a timeout

0:35:34.980,0:35:37.980
and

0:35:54.570,0:36:02.950
yeah do we just continue over that song

0:35:57.610,0:36:10.330
okay anyway yeah it's just thank you for

0:36:02.950,0:36:13.180
me it's like that but to me and like

0:36:10.330,0:36:14.950
what's interesting more than like our

0:36:13.180,0:36:19.270
concern just like things that I don't

0:36:14.950,0:36:21.280
know about they just get like it's a

0:36:19.270,0:36:22.750
part of you obviously yeah I don't think

0:36:21.280,0:36:24.340
I brush them to the rug at all like I

0:36:22.750,0:36:26.710
think I'm pretty open with you like I've

0:36:24.340,0:36:28.810
said in the past I think you think about

0:36:26.710,0:36:31.150
it a lot more than you think then you

0:36:28.810,0:36:32.260
speak a lot like you might be processing

0:36:31.150,0:36:33.670
it and I think there's certain times

0:36:32.260,0:36:36.130
even when I hear you sharing I'm like I

0:36:33.670,0:36:37.480
think in your mind you're like think you

0:36:36.130,0:36:38.920
talk about a lot more because you would

0:36:37.480,0:36:41.560
just say little it's like a bit like

0:36:38.920,0:36:43.720
little sparse things and I kind of have

0:36:41.560,0:36:45.100
to like puzzle piece in there there cuz

0:36:43.720,0:36:46.510
it's like one little thing in your head

0:36:45.100,0:36:48.550
you have all the details but it's like a

0:36:46.510,0:36:50.530
little like tiny little thing that you

0:36:48.550,0:36:51.910
say and that's the only thing I hear but

0:36:50.530,0:36:54.640
your mind like how do you not know like

0:36:51.910,0:36:55.900
I totally said that cuz you say these

0:36:54.640,0:36:57.460
little things out of context but it's

0:36:55.900,0:36:59.800
like I don't know what's underneath that

0:36:57.460,0:37:02.470
you know so you just get little pieces

0:36:59.800,0:37:03.520
of things and I have to try to jumble

0:37:02.470,0:37:05.350
them together and make my best

0:37:03.520,0:37:09.340
assessment of what that means purse is

0:37:05.350,0:37:11.290
like right okay so that's a lot of

0:37:09.340,0:37:13.060
rambling but what is the actual question

0:37:11.290,0:37:16.000
cuz I guess I don't really understand

0:37:13.060,0:37:17.770
what's going on because I'm like if you

0:37:16.000,0:37:26.230
if you want to ask us it's okay like I

0:37:17.770,0:37:28.060
said where did that how does that

0:37:26.230,0:37:31.180
resolve like there's obviously you still

0:37:28.060,0:37:34.440
like a uncertainty in you - I'm just

0:37:31.180,0:37:34.440
like wondering what that means to you

0:37:37.300,0:37:41.920
I mean I was having this conversation

0:37:39.730,0:37:44.470
with Nick Palacios just recently like I

0:37:41.920,0:37:46.360
think that's why our dynamic is so

0:37:44.470,0:37:47.410
unique just because I feel like I found

0:37:46.360,0:37:49.810
the perfect partner because you

0:37:47.410,0:37:52.870
understand we even talked about this I

0:37:49.810,0:37:57.280
feel like last night just like how in my

0:37:52.870,0:38:00.280
experience and I feel like several other

0:37:57.280,0:38:02.080
people's experiences like sexuality can

0:38:00.280,0:38:07.000
be very fluid and it doesn't have to be

0:38:02.080,0:38:07.600
like oh you know I'm gay I'm lesbian I'm

0:38:07.000,0:38:09.220
bisexual

0:38:07.600,0:38:10.870
none of that I'm like no there have just

0:38:09.220,0:38:13.330
been certain instances where I'm like

0:38:10.870,0:38:16.270
attracted to that person and it's caused

0:38:13.330,0:38:19.270
me not only just like a lot of really

0:38:16.270,0:38:21.850
fucked up hurt and stuff like that cuz

0:38:19.270,0:38:24.010
it's just very confusing I knew

0:38:21.850,0:38:26.800
immediately when I met you I was like oh

0:38:24.010,0:38:28.060
I choose this person and I didn't know I

0:38:26.800,0:38:30.760
mean for a while I was like maybe I will

0:38:28.060,0:38:33.190
end up with a woman I was open to that a

0:38:30.760,0:38:35.470
long time ago but now after meeting you

0:38:33.190,0:38:37.150
it was like I definitely know like you

0:38:35.470,0:38:39.400
had me at hello I knew that that wasn't

0:38:37.150,0:38:41.890
an issue anymore so it's not a matter of

0:38:39.400,0:38:44.680
oh well that's dead now it's just like

0:38:41.890,0:38:46.600
no I choose you and I would never do

0:38:44.680,0:38:48.100
anything to like fuck that up at this

0:38:46.600,0:38:51.160
point you know I mean like in the past

0:38:48.100,0:38:53.890
there I mean there was so much like it

0:38:51.160,0:38:56.740
was so like this with us that that very

0:38:53.890,0:39:00.280
much could have been you know a

0:38:56.740,0:39:02.830
dangerous place to be but I just am so

0:39:00.280,0:39:04.060
grateful that God has moved us so long

0:39:02.830,0:39:05.970
and we're not there anymore

0:39:04.060,0:39:09.450
you know just because that's like a very

0:39:05.970,0:39:09.450
dark place to be

0:39:11.750,0:39:29.119
- trust me what do you get okay what do

0:39:26.990,0:39:38.330
you get from your faith that supports

0:39:29.119,0:40:39.339
our relationship what do you get from my

0:39:38.330,0:40:39.339
face that's what we share at the core

0:40:45.280,0:40:56.420
okay

0:40:47.500,0:40:59.180
what would make you leave me well I mean

0:40:56.420,0:41:04.010
at this point it have to be something

0:40:59.180,0:41:06.130
really major but since we're not married

0:41:04.010,0:41:06.130
yet

0:41:06.820,0:41:12.770
and that would be even tougher but I

0:41:10.330,0:41:18.380
mean at this point I think it would have

0:41:12.770,0:41:23.500
to be finding out if like you were lying

0:41:18.380,0:41:23.500
about stuff I guess

0:41:23.510,0:41:34.380
yeah I think yeah like if I found out

0:41:30.780,0:41:38.940
the like you know you're lying about

0:41:34.380,0:41:42.300
stuff like with Maddie or whatever or I

0:41:38.940,0:41:43.530
I don't know right you know which it

0:41:42.300,0:41:45.180
would have not stuff from the past

0:41:43.530,0:41:47.880
necessarily but it would have to be like

0:41:45.180,0:41:49.530
if there was stuff like because I asked

0:41:47.880,0:41:53.360
you that just recently you know you're

0:41:49.530,0:41:57.630
really not an issue and I trust that so

0:41:53.360,0:42:00.270
but that or I mean going back to kind of

0:41:57.630,0:42:04.200
like what I just get so emotional about

0:42:00.270,0:42:06.270
is just like if you take off and like

0:42:04.200,0:42:08.880
you're this like whatever and you've got

0:42:06.270,0:42:10.770
this whole career in music and then you

0:42:08.880,0:42:12.990
just kind of get lost in it which I

0:42:10.770,0:42:15.210
don't see you doing at all but you just

0:42:12.990,0:42:27.450
never know you know so like I mean I

0:42:15.210,0:42:28.590
again I know you and I know right I mean

0:42:27.450,0:42:30.870
I think it's just hard for anybody but

0:42:28.590,0:42:33.590
like yeah it has to be something like

0:42:30.870,0:42:33.590
wild like that

0:42:39.550,0:42:59.380
okay who has more power in our

0:42:47.750,0:43:03.020
relationship that's a weird question

0:42:59.380,0:43:05.119
I don't know I think just like with like

0:43:03.020,0:43:13.599
stronger with strong personalities or

0:43:05.119,0:43:22.339
something we both have them but gigantic

0:43:13.599,0:43:24.829
biceps that's why we're this jacket yeah

0:43:22.339,0:43:29.510
yeah but not like you know not like a

0:43:24.829,0:43:35.930
domineering way that's good no not like

0:43:29.510,0:43:42.200
I'm like this no no I think I think just

0:43:35.930,0:43:44.210
in general like maybe yeah long as

0:43:42.200,0:43:47.359
you're cool it's annoying if I would

0:43:44.210,0:43:48.770
have said me you're a girl those girls

0:43:47.359,0:43:50.180
those women they're like you're strong

0:43:48.770,0:43:52.910
independent woman I wear the pants in

0:43:50.180,0:43:55.339
the relationship I'm like no please

0:43:52.910,0:43:58.250
that's a very bizarre for us it looks

0:43:55.339,0:44:00.940
better I think yeah you would

0:43:58.250,0:44:04.579
self-destruct if I wasn't like Carol I

0:44:00.940,0:44:07.040
like yielding to like it's like less

0:44:04.579,0:44:08.960
stressful to like if you want to that's

0:44:07.040,0:44:10.640
so weird I'm just traditional Maui and I

0:44:08.960,0:44:12.410
watched my mom well I think I'm more

0:44:10.640,0:44:13.970
comfortable making decisions and things

0:44:12.410,0:44:16.660
at times that's where I knew you're

0:44:13.970,0:44:16.660
better at making decisions

0:44:22.000,0:44:27.450
the world yeah okay okay

0:44:27.550,0:44:46.840
what is one experience you wish we never

0:44:29.920,0:44:48.280
had see that's I mean this is I feel

0:44:46.840,0:44:50.020
like this is such a universal question

0:44:48.280,0:44:51.580
cuz like everyone would say well oh but

0:44:50.020,0:44:57.040
this is like how we got here today which

0:44:51.580,0:44:59.710
is true I would agree cuz I think it's

0:44:57.040,0:45:01.360
like what's the one thing I wish you

0:44:59.710,0:45:04.000
didn't do but it's kind of interesting

0:45:01.360,0:45:06.460
questions like what's one experience you

0:45:04.000,0:45:23.680
wish we never had it's kind of

0:45:06.460,0:45:26.560
interesting I mean I think yeah I'm like

0:45:23.680,0:45:33.040
I don't know I mean I wish that we

0:45:26.560,0:45:36.850
didn't have to experience like you'd

0:45:33.040,0:45:40.060
like kind of your whole process of like

0:45:36.850,0:45:42.460
trying to like I don't know like I just

0:45:40.060,0:45:48.130
we now have to work through so much

0:45:42.460,0:45:50.110
because of like the past of you not

0:45:48.130,0:45:51.490
really being I knew I knew that you

0:45:50.110,0:45:53.230
loved me and I knew that it wasn't that

0:45:51.490,0:45:54.640
you were unsure of me but I think you

0:45:53.230,0:45:57.580
were maybe unsure of yourself and like

0:45:54.640,0:46:00.580
certain things so I think that that just

0:45:57.580,0:46:02.170
like cause such it's like taking ten

0:46:00.580,0:46:03.580
steps back because we had to go there

0:46:02.170,0:46:04.660
like we both knew that we loved each

0:46:03.580,0:46:06.640
other where you both knew that we would

0:46:04.660,0:46:10.150
get to this point but all the shit that

0:46:06.640,0:46:11.620
went came with it was just like dating

0:46:10.150,0:46:13.960
other people and like it's just like

0:46:11.620,0:46:14.950
silly but it's like again it's like

0:46:13.960,0:46:19.010
that's kind of an interesting question

0:46:14.950,0:46:20.850
cuz it's like like

0:46:19.010,0:46:22.590
like I wish we could have just taken

0:46:20.850,0:46:28.040
somewhat of a shortcut in some of it

0:46:22.590,0:46:28.040
because it's like it was so stupid and

0:46:28.550,0:46:33.870
it was just like it caused so much pain

0:46:31.470,0:46:37.160
that like didn't wasn't necessary yeah

0:46:33.870,0:46:40.770
and now that causes a breach in trust

0:46:37.160,0:46:43.950
you know yeah when like if you were to

0:46:40.770,0:46:46.110
just listened from the beginning it was

0:46:43.950,0:46:52.860
just like I cut off on like little

0:46:46.110,0:46:54.720
trails all over the place then but and

0:46:52.860,0:46:57.660
then was annoying ironic thing is though

0:46:54.720,0:46:59.550
even is that I'm glad you figured it out

0:46:57.660,0:47:01.140
with Maddie for a little bit because

0:46:59.550,0:47:04.230
then I would have still won wondering

0:47:01.140,0:47:06.210
now yeah so I'm like I am so freakin

0:47:04.230,0:47:08.460
glad that that happened because I was

0:47:06.210,0:47:11.280
like okay in the background laughing

0:47:08.460,0:47:12.960
like I'm so stupid like I know that's

0:47:11.280,0:47:14.580
not gonna work but go ahead try just

0:47:12.960,0:47:15.030
figure that out like if that's gonna

0:47:14.580,0:47:16.650
work

0:47:15.030,0:47:18.270
I mean it's painful but I'm just glad

0:47:16.650,0:47:20.280
that that happened now because I could

0:47:18.270,0:47:22.410
not be engaged now not knowing there's

0:47:20.280,0:47:29.250
no way yeah not a chance

0:47:22.410,0:47:31.700
yeah I knew that's it oh no I don't all

0:47:29.250,0:47:31.700
right

0:47:33.830,0:47:39.270
well okay what do you wish you could

0:47:36.990,0:47:39.630
heal in me and what pain would you take

0:47:39.270,0:47:44.580
away

0:47:39.630,0:47:47.070
hmm I think I wish I oughta sleep ain't

0:47:44.580,0:47:50.610
about disappointment or you know

0:47:47.070,0:47:53.040
distrust and even I think some of the

0:47:50.610,0:47:57.050
stuff you touched on I'm even from my

0:47:53.040,0:47:57.050
kids I like things that maybe like

0:48:16.540,0:48:25.160
even the stuff that you shared when you

0:48:19.790,0:48:48.349
were in a transition explained you got

0:48:25.160,0:49:15.680
heat from both sides against you so to

0:48:48.349,0:49:22.940
me that's crazy what's your biggest

0:49:15.680,0:49:32.720
regret I mean I don't think this even

0:49:22.940,0:49:37.119
relates to us at all I think I think

0:49:32.720,0:49:40.220
when I look back at my time of just

0:49:37.119,0:49:42.859
speaking of that whole thing of just my

0:49:40.220,0:49:45.380
time of self exploration and figuring

0:49:42.859,0:49:49.309
out who I was and all of those things I

0:49:45.380,0:49:52.369
think that I just don't I was just like

0:49:49.309,0:49:54.049
yeah like I'd every pride and just like

0:49:52.369,0:49:56.960
so open about it

0:49:54.049,0:50:02.299
that I look back now older as an adult

0:49:56.960,0:50:05.540
or as a more mature adult now because I

0:50:02.299,0:50:09.349
wasn't it open to technically um and I

0:50:05.540,0:50:10.819
just regret now seeing what other

0:50:09.349,0:50:13.130
parents have to go through with their

0:50:10.819,0:50:15.650
kids like all they want is the best for

0:50:13.130,0:50:16.849
their children so I think for my parents

0:50:15.650,0:50:20.000
it was just a huge slap in the face

0:50:16.849,0:50:21.460
because instead of doing my best to

0:50:20.000,0:50:22.990
communicate

0:50:21.460,0:50:26.410
kind of what I was going through I think

0:50:22.990,0:50:29.440
I just was like honestly if you aren't

0:50:26.410,0:50:31.030
with this than by and just like shut

0:50:29.440,0:50:33.730
them out for four years which obviously

0:50:31.030,0:50:37.240
is now not the case but still I just

0:50:33.730,0:50:39.940
feel like that's like you know I don't

0:50:37.240,0:50:41.290
really you know I'm not the type but

0:50:39.940,0:50:42.570
like that's one thing that I look back

0:50:41.290,0:50:44.680
now and I go oh that was someone mature

0:50:42.570,0:50:48.610
just yeah like I should have been a

0:50:44.680,0:50:50.470
little bit more sensitive to that and I

0:50:48.610,0:50:52.420
see other people doing it now and that's

0:50:50.470,0:50:53.590
been a unique experience for me to be

0:50:52.420,0:50:54.640
like hey but like think about your

0:50:53.590,0:50:57.640
parents like I know that they're not

0:50:54.640,0:50:59.050
trying to like be mean they just want

0:50:57.640,0:51:00.310
the best for you and that is scary for

0:50:59.050,0:51:02.110
your daughter too now and just be kind

0:51:00.310,0:51:07.000
of confused to suit to she is sexually

0:51:02.110,0:51:10.120
so I think yeah just not every gret not

0:51:07.000,0:51:11.430
I think I did try and communicate I

0:51:10.120,0:51:14.830
don't know it's just like such a

0:51:11.430,0:51:18.210
interesting thing but I think at least

0:51:14.830,0:51:29.070
being a little bit more respectful yeah

0:51:18.210,0:51:29.070
instead of just putting all over okay

0:51:33.030,0:51:36.150
are we good

0:51:37.950,0:51:43.780
what do you think is the biggest

0:51:40.330,0:51:45.850
challenge of our relationship you really

0:51:43.780,0:51:49.330
do I know that's kind of a similar

0:51:45.850,0:51:51.790
question that we have um do you think

0:51:49.330,0:51:55.120
the biggest yeah I think that was very

0:51:51.790,0:51:57.550
similar I guess I could reiterate it

0:51:55.120,0:52:01.120
though I think the biggest challenge of

0:51:57.550,0:52:03.130
our relationship is that both of us and

0:52:01.120,0:52:05.740
this is different answer to I think both

0:52:03.130,0:52:08.350
of us have such a strong faith and have

0:52:05.740,0:52:13.530
such a strong commitment to like that

0:52:08.350,0:52:15.670
but also I think we both have similar

0:52:13.530,0:52:17.380
points of empathy for people have

0:52:15.670,0:52:19.390
nothing to do with that which is like

0:52:17.380,0:52:21.160
we're kind of bridges I think in certain

0:52:19.390,0:52:22.960
ways where we've kind of fallen into I

0:52:21.160,0:52:24.850
would never like label myself that but

0:52:22.960,0:52:26.290
it just seems like where we are like you

0:52:24.850,0:52:28.510
know working so heavily in the music

0:52:26.290,0:52:29.860
industry now and you working in like

0:52:28.510,0:52:32.440
you know the industry as well in

0:52:29.860,0:52:37.660
different facets and like it just seems

0:52:32.440,0:52:39.520
like we have like two very sometimes can

0:52:37.660,0:52:40.450
be very polar opposites worlds you know

0:52:39.520,0:52:43.030
what I mean they seem like it almost

0:52:40.450,0:52:44.980
like nemesis or something like that but

0:52:43.030,0:52:47.140
we're kind of uniquely displaced like in

0:52:44.980,0:52:49.600
both it just kind of happened that way

0:52:47.140,0:52:51.730
and I think we we both have an

0:52:49.600,0:52:54.370
understanding of these very different

0:52:51.730,0:52:56.440
paradigms and I think that will be a

0:52:54.370,0:52:59.440
that's a really beautiful thing because

0:52:56.440,0:53:01.870
I'll always err on the side of like and

0:52:59.440,0:53:05.110
you total you on the like humanity and

0:53:01.870,0:53:08.140
just people like you know just being

0:53:05.110,0:53:10.390
humans and all the good stuff but you

0:53:08.140,0:53:14.110
know a challenge could be like there are

0:53:10.390,0:53:16.200
very very bold very clear statements in

0:53:14.110,0:53:18.580
our faith that sometimes like to buy

0:53:16.200,0:53:19.660
those people that we may be like shake

0:53:18.580,0:53:21.760
hands with you know and like have

0:53:19.660,0:53:22.660
different yeah it works with so I think

0:53:21.760,0:53:24.940
that could be a challenge in our

0:53:22.660,0:53:27.910
relationship as we go on is there might

0:53:24.940,0:53:29.950
be like different opinions about who we

0:53:27.910,0:53:31.900
are and what we're about Oh from both

0:53:29.950,0:53:34.150
sides and I think that's just like that

0:53:31.900,0:53:36.400
is what it is it's just people that will

0:53:34.150,0:53:41.200
probably be a challenge now in probably

0:53:36.400,0:53:43.510
forever is what it is yeah a good thing

0:53:41.200,0:53:51.400
I don't think either of us struggle with

0:53:43.510,0:53:54.510
having opinions okay here we go last but

0:53:51.400,0:53:54.510
not least for you Oh

0:54:06.040,0:54:17.460
read yours what are the next steps in

0:54:15.340,0:54:22.650
our relationship

0:54:17.460,0:54:22.650
well next big step in our relationship

0:54:22.950,0:54:27.340
that's definitely a big step and the

0:54:25.720,0:54:29.800
little steps leading up into that would

0:54:27.340,0:54:33.250
just be like thinking in a more peaceful

0:54:29.800,0:54:35.020
place like living lies and you know

0:54:33.250,0:54:38.230
planning all that stuff out but that's a

0:54:35.020,0:54:40.030
big step and then I think our careers to

0:54:38.230,0:54:41.460
you know really being catalyst for each

0:54:40.030,0:54:44.230
other anything at what that looks like

0:54:41.460,0:54:45.520
and where we're gonna like melt together

0:54:44.230,0:54:46.870
and help each other you know in

0:54:45.520,0:54:50.410
different areas I think that's those

0:54:46.870,0:54:51.790
career careers and obviously marriage

0:54:50.410,0:54:58.210
whatever order that comes in seems like

0:54:51.790,0:55:01.480
they're kind of in parallel babies a lot

0:54:58.210,0:55:08.530
a lot of kids you're gonna change your

0:55:01.480,0:55:11.530
mind when you see when you see like the

0:55:08.530,0:55:13.180
first child you're gonna be like I'm not

0:55:11.530,0:55:14.670
doing this service of the world if I

0:55:13.180,0:55:19.810
don't make more of these little suckers

0:55:14.670,0:55:23.740
you know like just - yeah - good more

0:55:19.810,0:55:24.670
food just say some people are families I

0:55:23.740,0:55:28.840
want a militia

0:55:24.670,0:55:31.420
I want a little army okay you can have

0:55:28.840,0:55:37.950
like our own soccer team got nice to her

0:55:31.420,0:55:37.950
own school that's not the point

0:55:41.820,0:55:52.960
what oh here's one okay what are maybe

0:55:48.580,0:55:57.160
two or three things what some advice if

0:55:52.960,0:56:01.180
I were to be a better man for you and

0:55:57.160,0:56:04.300
better you know partner what are like

0:56:01.180,0:56:06.960
two or three things like bits of advice

0:56:04.300,0:56:20.369
you can give me to be better for you

0:56:06.960,0:56:22.650
I think I mean truthfully jeez I feel so

0:56:20.369,0:56:25.170
fucking blessed because like probably

0:56:22.650,0:56:31.260
like I hit the jackpot because I think

0:56:25.170,0:56:33.119
that you are just I feel badly for other

0:56:31.260,0:56:34.859
people honestly almost in every

0:56:33.119,0:56:38.220
relationship cuz I'm like most men are

0:56:34.859,0:56:42.690
not like you so I feel like you already

0:56:38.220,0:56:45.930
your mind is like way up here and like

0:56:42.690,0:56:47.700
most men are just like like oh my god so

0:56:45.930,0:56:53.670
annoying they know because I found out

0:56:47.700,0:57:00.809
much later we weren't dating whoever you

0:56:53.670,0:57:03.540
dated anyway but I think so I just want

0:57:00.809,0:57:07.290
to like obviously highlight that because

0:57:03.540,0:57:08.940
I think that I'm I think I think we've

0:57:07.290,0:57:10.859
talked about this to like you know you

0:57:08.940,0:57:11.900
are in the right relationship when you

0:57:10.859,0:57:14.130
need to feel lucky to have each other

0:57:11.900,0:57:16.170
but I definitely am like no I'm the

0:57:14.130,0:57:19.140
lucky one for sure just because you're

0:57:16.170,0:57:20.400
so like understanding and stuff and just

0:57:19.140,0:57:21.599
emotionally intelligent like that's a

0:57:20.400,0:57:23.309
real thing and I think that a lot of

0:57:21.599,0:57:27.030
people don't know what that is and they

0:57:23.309,0:57:28.170
don't exercise that and run towards it

0:57:27.030,0:57:31.440
and that's something I mean obviously

0:57:28.170,0:57:33.000
and even this type of setting I always

0:57:31.440,0:57:36.020
know that you're gonna be by my side and

0:57:33.000,0:57:38.520
like we always challenge you know

0:57:36.020,0:57:43.079
expanding our minds and that means like

0:57:38.520,0:57:46.440
really cool but I think I mean just

0:57:43.079,0:57:48.540
again like working on you know which we

0:57:46.440,0:57:50.730
are already but just being sensitive and

0:57:48.540,0:57:52.079
like different things that like you may

0:57:50.730,0:57:54.030
I don't need you to understand

0:57:52.079,0:57:56.040
necessarily but just if I'm

0:57:54.030,0:57:58.680
communicating like hey that that really

0:57:56.040,0:58:00.750
upsets me or whatever just being like oh

0:57:58.680,0:58:02.369
really sensitive to the point where you

0:58:00.750,0:58:03.869
feel nauseated just because you're like

0:58:02.369,0:58:06.480
oh my gosh this is so stupid I hate

0:58:03.869,0:58:07.710
having to be like like baby her but

0:58:06.480,0:58:09.510
there's certain things I'm like I don't

0:58:07.710,0:58:12.480
care if you don't get why it that's me

0:58:09.510,0:58:15.990
but it does so just like from the for

0:58:12.480,0:58:17.190
okay I'm so sorry like instead of just

0:58:15.990,0:58:18.390
being like it's not a big deal

0:58:17.190,0:58:21.150
I'm like no it is

0:58:18.390,0:58:23.160
and vice-versa I can take that on myself

0:58:21.150,0:58:37.100
but yeah I don't think they maybe be

0:58:23.160,0:58:39.750
more sensitive I think just continuing

0:58:37.100,0:58:42.510
like I've said this before but always

0:58:39.750,0:58:45.630
just like being the leader spiritually

0:58:42.510,0:58:52.260
because I think I need that I think

0:58:45.630,0:58:53.700
you're a lot more spiritually I don't

0:58:52.260,0:58:56.400
know how exactly for that I just know

0:58:53.700,0:58:58.200
that what I see for my partner like the

0:58:56.400,0:59:01.800
ideal partner for me is someone that's

0:58:58.200,0:59:05.490
just constantly challenging me in my

0:59:01.800,0:59:07.590
walk with God and just like initiate

0:59:05.490,0:59:08.910
like I agree with you and you've said

0:59:07.590,0:59:10.290
this in the past like that has to be

0:59:08.910,0:59:12.270
something that like you want to do on

0:59:10.290,0:59:15.030
your own which I do and I feel so

0:59:12.270,0:59:17.550
grateful that God has like gotten ahold

0:59:15.030,0:59:20.160
of my heart and I do seek that but as my

0:59:17.550,0:59:22.140
partner and a leader of my home and my

0:59:20.160,0:59:25.140
future family like I just always want

0:59:22.140,0:59:26.850
you to be the one that's like hey you

0:59:25.140,0:59:28.080
know its prey or like hey like they're

0:59:26.850,0:59:29.970
just little things like that and like

0:59:28.080,0:59:31.740
let's start our morning devotional like

0:59:29.970,0:59:35.160
all those things that like I definitely

0:59:31.740,0:59:37.890
want for us I think if you were the one

0:59:35.160,0:59:47.850
leaving that I would get like excited

0:59:37.890,0:59:49.160
about that okay that's great I think it

0:59:47.850,0:59:52.110
could be something to not do as well

0:59:49.160,0:59:56.400
yeah okay well here's one so I think

0:59:52.110,0:59:58.290
just like you know I think I'm just

0:59:56.400,1:00:01.530
being sensitive to the fact that like I

0:59:58.290,1:00:03.360
mean and I I relate to this too but I

1:00:01.530,1:00:06.390
guess it's different because it's coming

1:00:03.360,1:00:10.620
from a different dynamic but you're just

1:00:06.390,1:00:11.910
a very friendly guy and I think we've

1:00:10.620,1:00:12.990
talked about this in the past my dad's

1:00:11.910,1:00:17.520
very friendly he was in the

1:00:12.990,1:00:19.620
entertainment business as well but never

1:00:17.520,1:00:22.080
letting anyone confuse that for you

1:00:19.620,1:00:24.330
flirting because I don't want any eyes

1:00:22.080,1:00:25.920
on any side whether it's that female

1:00:24.330,1:00:27.780
thinking that you're flirting because

1:00:25.920,1:00:29.130
we're being too friendly or whether it's

1:00:27.780,1:00:31.109
other people in the room

1:00:29.130,1:00:34.859
thinking that that's the case just

1:00:31.109,1:00:36.480
because that's like so frustrating so I

1:00:34.859,1:00:38.579
think just oh and I think you are really

1:00:36.480,1:00:41.309
good about that definitely but just

1:00:38.579,1:00:43.109
again in the future like oh just like

1:00:41.309,1:00:44.819
around so many different thing and we

1:00:43.109,1:00:47.910
both are so I'm taking this unlike

1:00:44.819,1:00:50.009
reciprocating and we're both mirrors but

1:00:47.910,1:00:53.819
I think just like making sure that could

1:00:50.009,1:00:55.490
never be taken wrong ever you know what

1:00:53.819,1:00:57.809
I mean mm-hmm

1:00:55.490,1:00:59.730
even like respectful in the fact like no

1:00:57.809,1:01:00.630
number like nothing like just even like

1:00:59.730,1:01:01.019
what kinda what we talked about the

1:01:00.630,1:01:03.299
other day

1:01:01.019,1:01:04.500
just like talk to linen about it cuz

1:01:03.299,1:01:05.970
that's the more respectful thing to do

1:01:04.500,1:01:07.740
it's hard because we're like young and

1:01:05.970,1:01:09.740
in LA and like networking and all those

1:01:07.740,1:01:12.269
things but like I just think it's tough

1:01:09.740,1:01:15.410
because that can be taken so wrong like

1:01:12.269,1:01:17.579
oh yeah like let me text it like I just

1:01:15.410,1:01:19.849
it's a tough thing but I think that

1:01:17.579,1:01:19.849
that's
