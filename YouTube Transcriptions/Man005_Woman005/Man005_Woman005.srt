1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:31,679

love me I think well I loved you

4
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,180
probably before you actually loved me I

5
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,860
think the way that I love you now I

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,769
think I definitely loved you before you

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:52,170
laugh but I think I loved or love how

8
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:54,059
passionate you are like that's like the

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,250
first thing that I was like so attracted

10
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,199
to so I just love your passion just for

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,299
life and for your relationship with God

12
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:11,369
and all those things and because God

13
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:15,150
told me to I don't use your choice think

14
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:20,360
about this well I mean that's like the

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,360
main reasons because you're a good man

16
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:52,520
so I asked for my pals yes that looks

17
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,000
like you were writing I know that's so

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,640
weird

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,890
who are these yeah yeah a little less

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
legible

21
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:07,700
how about legit looks exactly like your

22
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,660
writing that's very bad not bad look

23
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,840
it's never a fault

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,250
like we read it what I'm not I grew up

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:21,580
in a generation we not to write anything

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:21,580
I wish they taught us calligraphy is a

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:32,060
perfect okay so when was the moment you

28
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,160
knew you loved me well this is

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,980
interesting

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,480
because I think if I were now looking

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,510
back because I can say it would be now a

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:47,180
lot more but I think I knew I loved you

33
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,209
when we started hanging out like my

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,510
first friends but I just had a cannon so

35
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,670
much like other shit and overlapping

36
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,260
things in my life look like total

37
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,660
insecurities and things were obvious I'm

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:04,459
not ignoring it and then eventually

39
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,709
sabotage it so I knew I mean if I was

40
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:08,450
just like not at that I'm just gonna be

41
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,850
like you're my buddy this is a great no

42
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,730
problem you know and then the moment we

43
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,430
started like dating and getting close I

44
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,079
was just like trying to like put it in

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,670
like a little compartment because I was

46
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,670
like I knew it was like

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:04:00,400
you know yes I was not I was not like

48
00:03:39,790 --> 00:04:00,400
bullshitting myself I was like oh okay

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:09,730
yeah so it was like you know you know

50
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:49,690
are you directing this map that's okay

51
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:53,240
describe your first impression of me

52
00:04:49,690 --> 00:05:02,960
well let's see my first impression of

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:06,070
you you're obviously dating Lauren okay

54
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,180
well you were dating my best friend and

55
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,150
we were really young and I just

56
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,560
remembered you were really really like

57
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,610
funny and just full of energy and so

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,410
naturally everyone's attracted to that

59
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,139
type of personality so that was my first

60
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,690
impression just kind of like he's so fun

61
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,580
and he's like so cool I always thought

62
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,169
you were like so cool I was like he's

63
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,470
like so cool yet cool friends

64
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:34,410
so like I read what I was like 15 that

65
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,850
was technically for a suggestion

66
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,580
and then there was like another first

67
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:43,479
impression later wouldn't there be well

68
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,750
but that's my first impression that's

69
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,750
cool

70
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:55,900
what what's your three favorite memories

71
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,880
that we've shared mm-hmm

72
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:04,350
should we wait for that plane since

73
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:06,850
there's like an airport right here hmm

74
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,000
that's actually hard to choose in a good

75
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,000
way

76
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,410
the first one that comes to my mind I

77
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,889
might like go out of order

78
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,530
chronologically it's like our first like

79
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,760
turnaround trip to California when you

80
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,979
got hired at done here and that was your

81
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,100
first job there buddy to LA and a high

82
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:29,560
audition for the voice and made it

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,750
season three and then we came right back

84
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,240
Oh week week or so later but that was

85
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,889
like Taniya I was like that was a really

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,389
strong memory I'm just like cuz it was

87
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,099
like the start of like so much other

88
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:47,500
stuff you know especially now I'm living

89
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:49,030
here over couple years let's see I think

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,180
that when we first started dating I

91
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,720
remember when a very strong memory it

92
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,360
was just like those it was like wine bar

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,260
that we first like and I was connected

94
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,270
no one to sorry

95
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,710
oh no no La Paloma it was more that La

96
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,870
Paloma was at the Starbucks

97
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,849
yeah we like I know unfortunately I was

98
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,990
better coffee but know when we first I

99
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,500
thought like hey let's have a business

100
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,539
meeting

101
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,820
and you shared all this really dope shit

102
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,710
about like your vision for I was like

103
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,620
that I think that's when I was first

104
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,090
oh my god this is crazy like because you

105
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,440
shared all this come credible like

106
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,509
vision about like your beauty stuff and

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,600
and I was like really like now I was

108
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,340
like now you're like going because like

109
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,949
really pumped because it's like about

110
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,870
entrepreneurship stuff like all of your

111
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,550
huge vision for like now you like

112
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,110
surpassed all that stuff already anyways

113
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,590
for the most not really other than like

114
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,870
the cool coloring book ideas really

115
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:51,900
perfect yeah but like all that stuff I

116
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,900
remember that was really strong I think

117
00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:01,750
an obvious like oh we can go this fast

118
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,330
Tuesday when I proposed to you and you

119
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:10,720
said yes to becoming my wife that's

120
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:12,039
pretty good that's my favorite you got

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,860
me you shocked me

122
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:18,300
I was that good one my turn that's right

123
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,300
no no no it's yours actually is it yeah

124
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:29,820
this is fun

125
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:33,130
when do you feel closest to me I think

126
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:36,150
that's a good question I think I feel

127
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,740
closest when and this could be an

128
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,709
interesting thing but like the first

129
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,050
thing that came to mind was when we

130
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:48,700
might be disagreeing on something but

131
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,740
you kind of I'm able to communicate with

132
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,000
you in a way that you understand and

133
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,230
then you not necessarily compromise but

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,820
you're just really sensitive and like

135
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,800
understanding about it and I feel just

136
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,390
like I'll thank God you know what I mean

137
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,150
so I feel like really close when you're

138
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,779
just like understanding whether or not

139
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,459
maybe you agree or something like that

140
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,920
but you're just kind of like okay honey

141
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:13,630
like data and I'm maybe that can be

142
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,950
reciprocal but I feel like really close

143
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,570
to you at that point something yes it's

144
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,089
a win all right

145
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,680
right why does it feel like a win well

146
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:25,149
just that's cool that's good to know I'm

147
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,680
like oh yeah take that I got it and we

148
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,829
got a camera in case I forget it like

149
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,829
said

150
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,550
just because I feel like I mean

151
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,440
obviously in any relationship the

152
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,300
hardest thing is communication between a

153
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,060
male and a female and just understanding

154
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,070
each other and what kind of things are

155
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,139
extremely upsetting to me that maybe

156
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,360
aren't upsetting to you but for you to

157
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,009
just step back and go okay this doesn't

158
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,000
really make sense to me but like I'm

159
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:54,300
going to I guess yeah maybe the word is

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,819
compromised and just understand that

161
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,410
it's not about like you know I don't

162
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:03,910
have to understand and the fact that you

163
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,290
just kind of let it I don't know I don't

164
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,639
explain it but you know I mean like when

165
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,430
we just kind of come to some sort of

166
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,529
resolve yeah I'm still wearing that well

167
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,500
we both are yeah but I think that that's

168
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:16,060
when and we're getting better and better

169
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,259
I thought which is great and I think

170
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:28,710
that that's and I feel closest cuz I'm

171
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:31,260
like we can do this yeah okay

172
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,960
what do you think is the hardest thing

173
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,300
for me right now

174
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,430
that's big what do you think the hardest

175
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,820
thing for me what do you think is the

176
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:49,260
hardest thing for me right now mm-hmm

177
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:51,540
I guess it's like let's see I think that

178
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,860
well I guess there's a few different

179
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:59,750
things that's like a let's see what do

180
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,750
you think that means to you though no no

181
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,050
I think practically

182
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,880
you know like obviously right now where

183
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,730
things are at like there's so much great

184
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,740
stuff that we've been building and

185
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,529
obviously like and I knew it was the

186
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,970
right thing like to get engaged

187
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,140
obviously we both feel like a strong

188
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,770
sense of peace for that but I think

189
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,370
what's probably hard is fully like

190
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,899
trusting the process because not

191
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,510
everything's like in order you know

192
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,220
right now I'm learning to trust more and

193
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,980
more than me probably he's really hard

194
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:36,360
and more and more and you know God and

195
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,000
he's leading us to which can seem really

196
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,470
really psychotic at times and really

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,260
unreliable and like completely the exact

198
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:51,089
opposite of like what most stable people

199
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:53,880
would do and insane people would do yeah

200
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:57,330
I bet you that's hard being with an

201
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,250
insane person but like you know I can

202
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,200
imagine no I wear that sometimes I'm

203
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,089
sure I do I wear that sometimes I'm

204
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,240
thinking like wow that's got to be so

205
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:10,110
hard for her because I don't know me and

206
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,060
obviously I you know me but you know I

207
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,190
always worry about that like being

208
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,860
difficult to be like me I can probably

209
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,350
have the worst I can have like this and

210
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,329
that that and I think even in your your

211
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,139
own self to you

212
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:25,239
entrepreneurial goals and your own

213
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:28,449
career goals and life goals and things

214
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:30,100
like that so the gap between like it

215
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:32,439
feeling like it's really really close

216
00:12:30,100 --> 00:13:00,489
and not a time especially like right

217
00:12:32,439 --> 00:13:08,249
right now specifically the director of

218
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:10,709
the cards that's that makes sense um

219
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:24,419
started

220
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:27,699
what are you hesitant to tell me I think

221
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:30,730
like at this point I mean I think these

222
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:37,089
conversations kind of come up a little

223
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:40,720
bit but I get hesitant to imagine your

224
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:45,939
career as a musician blowing up just

225
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,119
because it's scary it's like there's

226
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:48,119
like

227
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:04,730
like all the things like because I know

228
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:09,860
the music is so good I love it but it's

229
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:12,200
just hard because I see like how just

230
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,950
these men just become like completely

231
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,290
like like sex and bulls in like they're

232
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,140
just like so the attention is all on

233
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,450
them and so I obviously just struggle

234
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,170
with so much insecurity as it is so -

235
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:31,430
like even think about all these eyes

236
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:35,210
like on you and just like mm-hmm that

237
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:37,880
lifestyle is just so tough so like for

238
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:41,780
us because we've like struggled past

239
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,400
with just like so much shit then it's

240
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,400
just scary to me and I know that like

241
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,820
our relationship is solid and like

242
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,920
obviously being engaged is helpful but

243
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:57,430
it still doesn't a gate the fact that

244
00:14:51,920 --> 00:15:04,100
like I just get so worried that like I

245
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:05,990
don't know you know like I don't know

246
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,590
like that's it's just like so hard cuz I

247
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,710
want to be so supportive and I am but at

248
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,150
the same time it's like I get hesitate

249
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,000
cuz I'm like well yeah but what about my

250
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,890
career like I want my stuff to blow up

251
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,550
and like you have this whole energy like

252
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:25,610
around your team and and just like a lot

253
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,020
of our stuff parallels so much so then

254
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,440
it's like and we've kind of talked about

255
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:33,620
this but like just I just don't want to

256
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,320
be left in the dust of like your music

257
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,190
blowing up and then you just being like

258
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,650
oh yeah well I make youtube videos and I

259
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,120
know that financially if that does

260
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,700
happen for you cuz then I could just

261
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,310
like kind of do whatever I want and

262
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:54,260
produce shit like this which is what I

263
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:56,420
want but that's just like yeah scary

264
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,160
like all of it scary to me just other

265
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,920
girls and like all that shit like the

266
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,420
music industry is just so gross so

267
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,370
that's like thankfully like we're

268
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,910
Christians and like all that I know will

269
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:19,960
be different

270
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:19,960
it's just hard okay thank you

271
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:46,370
it turns out you won like it's just

272
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,170
gonna be shitty if like like you've

273
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,390
already seen how I get with like other

274
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:55,970
girls so like it's gonna be hell I feel

275
00:16:50,390 --> 00:17:01,310
bad for that like if I see any I'm like

276
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:11,780
uh-uh don't even like freaking flip out

277
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:24,250
that's what I said I said no there's no

278
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:24,250
girls and I'm like that's not happening

279
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:32,680
what could I do to improve our

280
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,680
relationship

281
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:53,070
it's nice what could you what could I do

282
00:17:51,120 --> 00:18:03,889
so what can you do what can I do what

283
00:17:53,070 --> 00:18:06,330
can you do I think just in general like

284
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:12,659
I said to you before and it's obviously

285
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:14,129
like you know with not a sturdy past

286
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,169
that's pretty late to leaner and I

287
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:19,169
understand that but just like what I

288
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:21,269
know and like where I'm at like even

289
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:24,360
like in my heart and when I see for both

290
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:27,779
like I think what could really improve

291
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,460
our relationship and just you in general

292
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,259
would just be like I think just really

293
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,490
taking a chance to trust me more Milan

294
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:37,409
things and you know you have a you're a

295
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,909
strong woman you know and you have a lot

296
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,100
of tendencies to like do things on your

297
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,529
own and I think you're learning more to

298
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,119
like find the value in that and I just

299
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:49,200
think like the world would open up you

300
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,889
know in our relationship I think if

301
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,480
there was a deeper level of trust like

302
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:55,110
we continue to like explore you know

303
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,389
what I mean

304
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,610
and I want that I want that like full

305
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:01,590
confidence we just like you don't have

306
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,799
to like kick and scream sometimes and

307
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,799
like

308
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,029
because I'm like getting back of my head

309
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,029
I'm just like shaking my head to say

310
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,779
like seeking to understand you know

311
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,940
because that's a half of that I'm like

312
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,169
you understood and you could show me

313
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,389
that you can understand where I'm coming

314
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:38,309
from me you would see that I'm swimming

315
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,899
you know you can see that how i'm having

316
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:41,519
your best interest their heart more than

317
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,460
i think i get credit for but it's

318
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,230
changing that's the what i'm saying i'm

319
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,000
even recently i'm seeing like total

320
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:53,250
shifts who knew that that finger was

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:58,010
like the magic ring you know just in

322
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,010
general like allowing that space to like

323
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:21,480
right yes oh I guess the bottom of the

324
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:24,169
barrel is good I said am I the best sex

325
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,169
you've ever had

326
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:35,429
oh cool seriously no but my hey

327
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:42,840
background no no not like that but I

328
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:45,179
just mean like the answer is clearly you

329
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,570
remove me from the darks - I saw the

330
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,570
light

331
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:55,169
it's so embarrassing like that should be

332
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:58,260
like no you like you like helped out the

333
00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:03,179
King where do you want to expand that no

334
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:06,360
okay well there you have it

335
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:12,899
when do you get jealous of me being with

336
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:14,310
others um I'm not as you know I'm not

337
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:16,890
like the jealous type

338
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:20,370
in general when I I'm really not maybe I

339
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:22,380
should be more sometimes no because um I

340
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,940
think there's times if I do get jealous

341
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,970
it's a number like time because I like

342
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,180
spending time with you and where I get

343
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,460
most jealous if it's like you know

344
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:35,070
something or someone or even if it's

345
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,840
like something you know stressful or

346
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:43,890
whatever that's like taking you away

347
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:47,730
from the lake sometimes anything makes

348
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,110
you feel like you can it's not

349
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,180
necessarily people I'm like I would

350
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,470
never worry about late if he went on

351
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,690
camera yeah that question probably

352
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:58,710
would've been better if it was for me

353
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,300
my and maybe yeah I don't really I guess

354
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,070
it's a good thing you know but I'm just

355
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,900
not like that anyways I might just get

356
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,060
jealous when I get sent on work trips to

357
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,970
Disney World in your case yeah that is

358
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,400
fair enough I'm just like that's dumb I

359
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,430
should go yeah for four days in Disney

360
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:27,300
World for work I definitely could be a

361
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:30,180
part of that I got yeah

362
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:35,520
do you know just ask one no I'm good at

363
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:38,760
this what's the biggest sacrifice you've

364
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,250
made that I haven't acknowledged that's

365
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,510
a good question the biggest sacrifice

366
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:47,970
that I've made that you haven't

367
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,840
acknowledged yeah what's the biggest

368
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,840
sacrifice you've made

369
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:10,320
I mean cuz I feel like I've definitely

370
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:13,920
made lots of sacrifices and that was

371
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,840
vice versa but I think that you do a

372
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,370
really good job of acknowledging it but

373
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,940
I'm trying to think of one that like I

374
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:23,270
feel like you have anything or maybe not

375
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,270
I know

376
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,870
I mean maybe I mean like this is like

377
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,270
kind of silly but like the thing that

378
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:50,640
comes to mind I mean like I think again

379
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:53,400
we'd like to discuss this but maybe like

380
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,370
a big sacrifice has been just having you

381
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,180
and Gracie you know sharing my space

382
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:03,930
which is your dog so having you and now

383
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,760
we have two dogs and two humans in my

384
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,710
room and obviously really sharing that

385
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,630
space right now and so I think that

386
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,100
that's I mean but you pretty much

387
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,640
acknowledge it for sure like we've

388
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,830
talked about this but I think because

389
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,450
like what I'd create is a lot of the

390
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,610
times from my room and so I think that's

391
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:24,240
just like so stressful to try and feel

392
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:26,400
inspired to like film in that space when

393
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,810
there's just not which I'm so glad we're

394
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,430
moving but I think that's like probably

395
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,500
one of the biggest sacrifices in the

396
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:52,350
last its I'd say like few months for

397
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:54,920
like year whatever but yeah this was on

398
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,730
the I wrote gonna see my penmanship yeah

399
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,260
it's a lot different than than

400
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,260
penmanship on these curtains I see

401
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:13,070
I mean something I don't know what is it

402
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,600
okay whatever just a secret that you

403
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:27,530
have been afraid to tell you yeah but

404
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:29,300
let's get juicier I know you're not

405
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,470
gonna tell me what I want to know like

406
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,970
so why don't you just ask me the

407
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,320
question I don't know like that's what

408
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,580
I'm saying it's obviously there's stuff

409
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,020
that I don't know so what is something

410
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,930
that you're like she doesn't need to

411
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,300
know that yeah I feel like I don't

412
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,490
really have any like secrets like we've

413
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,050
kind of already been there and covered

414
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:53,450
that stuff it's like I don't really like

415
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:54,740
keeping secrets if you were like ask me

416
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,050
like a point-blank question I could be

417
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,350
like okay okay then what's something

418
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:04,760
specifically in the last couple years

419
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:09,140
that you've never told me that you know

420
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:12,620
I would be upset about or you've been

421
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:15,790
like not telling me just because you're

422
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,980
trying to protect me being sad or that's

423
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:23,000
that's such a loaded question I'm like

424
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,200
getting myself like in trouble yeah I

425
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,300
mean like the only thing that comes to

426
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,780
my mind was like just all that the time

427
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:33,970
where I was like my taking time with

428
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:42,230
like the ex situation and I'm just like

429
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:44,950
brushing a lot of I just wanna dismiss

430
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,950
this from my life

431
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,059
yeah so I was like for me I was like

432
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,450
trying to think about that and at the

433
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:12,739
same time like knowing that really

434
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,679
knowing her like we had much more like

435
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:17,330
at stake was like put me in an

436
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,940
interesting position because it's like

437
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:23,570
all right like you know if it was like

438
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,249
okay

439
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,720
damned if I do damned if I don't you

440
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:28,730
know if I'm being authentic even if I

441
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,559
know that I know this is probably going

442
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,320
to like self cracked one way or another

443
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,820
and being authentic about that but also

444
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,940
being out and about like I knew in my

445
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,340
heart like it was gonna work itself out

446
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,909
like between you and I but it was just

447
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:48,649
like a really weird time so I like

448
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:57,200
obviously I'm smoothing over things

449
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:59,109
about your things like you know like

450
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:21,259
communication or hearing from her or

451
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:23,480
whatever okay yeah okay here you go

452
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:25,669
here's mine

453
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,009
there's my actually that's not Bannon

454
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:32,299
ready I think a nice pace yeah uh-oh

455
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:34,429
what is the question I said well this is

456
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:36,559
a my curiosity because obviously like

457
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:37,789
it's always been curious not you know

458
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,410
I've been supportive himself of like

459
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,910
you've dated girls for like a long time

460
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,640
for me and there's still certain things

461
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:47,100
that come up where I'm kind of curious

462
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,680
like okay what does that mean I don't

463
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,910
wait too that you know at all so my

464
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,190
curiosity this is a specific question

465
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,420
but over the past three years that we've

466
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,040
been dating on and off three plus years

467
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,100
that we've been dating on and off while

468
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:03,060
we were off did you date or what if you

469
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:06,090
know that once well maybe I mean I was

470
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,310
making once that was like maybe I don't

471
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,130
have divulge no I don't think so

472
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:15,060
I don't know wait a minute wait a minute

473
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,260
I like to remember no wait no but really

474
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,170
it was like nothing to be worried about

475
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:21,270
when was this a long time ago I was when

476
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,160
I was living in moral a drive house I

477
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,160
think I don't like have to think about

478
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,110
it just Megan you didn't kiss any other

479
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,590
girl but that's your next girlfriend

480
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:38,190
yeah but I was like not even oh come on

481
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:45,090
what's weird because it was like you're

482
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:47,600
not yeah but you are off really right so

483
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:56,000
you're entitled to a girlfriend because

484
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:56,000
it's a girl and so it's fine

485
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,350
no that's not how it works what happened

486
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,090
oh you did Wow like how long ago what's

487
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,280
a long time that could be like three

488
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:09,030
weeks or something out the longer no

489
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:12,600
like literally it was when we weren't

490
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:14,760
even living out here yet and you and I

491
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,220
were just starting to talk so he said

492
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,390
since we've been off and on

493
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,080
that's like the Marley Drive that

494
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,500
doesn't make sense

495
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:27,870
I don't remember I don't remember I

496
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:30,120
honestly I just remember I there's that

497
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,410
there's that weird nervous laugh no

498
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,530
really I'm like trying to piece it

499
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:36,540
together I I thought no I'm really I'm

500
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:39,540
not lying I swear to God I think it was

501
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,390
during the time when I came out here to

502
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,280
visit because I remember going it was

503
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,960
I'm getting confused because we also

504
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,100
hung out once

505
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,510
the Marley Drive house but it was not

506
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,960
even like that so I think it was

507
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:53,179
actually before I moved out here and I

508
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,710
was visiting for my birthday actually

509
00:30:53,179 --> 00:31:05,330
it's weird you have such a detailed

510
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:07,750
specific memory I just say yeah no I

511
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,750
mean I would

512
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,640
I'm answering I think you don't know is

513
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:14,210
your verdict is because there was not a

514
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,919
big deal

515
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:20,659
oh that's how ass yeah I'm answering the

516
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:26,270
question so did you go on a date with a

517
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:29,000
girl yeah no they all asked still okay

518
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,440
know if anyone it was not female so you

519
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,179
would have to be worried about what you

520
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:37,399
knew that that's not anything like

521
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,330
honestly that's not what you should have

522
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,100
been worried about when we were not

523
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,140
together it was the other guys that I

524
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,789
was dating that's what I'm worried about

525
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:51,110
huh that's not what I was worried about

526
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:53,450
I know I don't know why okay that's was

527
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,250
curious me I would be a lot more concern

528
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,409
about guys which now is not a problem

529
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,760
but like I don't know why you put too

530
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:00,110
much focus on that kind of stuff cuz it

531
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:11,510
doesn't matter well it matters in

532
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:14,630
certain in certain moments I like still

533
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,890
like it still lingers a little bit as

534
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,179
far as like attracting the girls but

535
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,710
there's no action but it's still curious

536
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:21,620
I'm still curious about it because it's

537
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,510
still present in some way or another I'm

538
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,860
not like worried about it like as far as

539
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,860
if the relationship but it definitely

540
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:33,830
don't have like this like fluid

541
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:35,510
attraction and males are involved

542
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,539
females are involved and you're involved

543
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:41,059
you would be like what the fuck

544
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:42,440
what so I was out we I'm you're not

545
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,870
gonna get a what the fuck out of me

546
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,680
you're gonna get fill me fill in the

547
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,740
blanks

548
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,810
no question like you know empathize if

549
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,440
you either and I'm like I come left with

550
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,910
like all right you know and so in some

551
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,260
situations because I'm kind of like okay

552
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,580
I think I understand but then there's

553
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,990
like little curve balls that come where

554
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,520
I'm just like Kaylee fill in the blanks

555
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,130
you know Mike help me understand more

556
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,950
because I obviously can't relate to that

557
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,680
in a parallel way you know so it's like

558
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,600
that's why I wrote that question not

559
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,920
about me because I'm actually glad it's

560
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,620
about that cuz that's an easy answer

561
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:18,050
then questions about when you and I were

562
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:21,200
off and I was doing other people so I'm

563
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,400
glad that's one thing like that's not

564
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,740
even anything to be worrying about

565
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,910
okay so what should I worry nothing

566
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,930
that's a different question that you

567
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:32,060
didn't get and we were stuck no you

568
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,650
should be worried now I'm saying in the

569
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,270
past yeah there was a lot to be worried

570
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,920
would you share you just avoid you just

571
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,780
evaded my entire question and just

572
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,460
rerouted it to something that was it's

573
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,750
irrelevant to me in this question like I

574
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,030
asked you that for a reason you know

575
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,130
okay what is the question well yeah okay

576
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:49,520
so the answer's no have you been dating

577
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,930
on our did you go on a date and worry

578
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,190
physical with if you don't know we

579
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,450
technical answer's no that's saying like

580
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,540
even just recently there's been

581
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,160
conversations about like you and you're

582
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,600
attracting females and that's something

583
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,860
that's a concern to me like what you do

584
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,840
with what you choose to tell me about

585
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,310
the people you've dated other people you

586
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,570
told me about other people didn't talk

587
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,570
to you I mean you think it's relevant

588
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,790
I'm like to me that's something that's

589
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,710
curious

590
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,030
I'm genuinely curious about because I'm

591
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,220
like I don't understand it right well

592
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:19,610
that's a different question

593
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:21,410
okay okay that's not the question you're

594
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:24,050
asking the question the answer to that

595
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:26,030
is no okay but if you're asking a

596
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:30,260
different question of like should I be

597
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:33,320
concerned when we're married if you're

598
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,940
going to watch you know me with a girl

599
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,650
or something that's how it is

600
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,480
well then what's the question yeah I

601
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,790
mean if ever a spinoff of that question

602
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,380
will just be like explain that it's more

603
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,030
open than anything I'm not like saying

604
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,380
yes or no cuz yes or no it's easy it can

605
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,140
be like technically speaking no

606
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,560
technically speaking yes but the nuance

607
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,750
that's important it's a

608
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,540
like the details you know the tell us

609
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,790
the details and most things so it's like

610
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,930
if I'm seeking to understand you and

611
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,120
that's a part of you that seems very

612
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,100
like suppressed at times but they it

613
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,000
pops up in what's wrong but I'm okay

614
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,950
like whatever

615
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,710
you know I still curious about it it's

616
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:11,180
still a part of you you can't like fully

617
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,180
oh do we need a timeout

618
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,980
and

619
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:02,950
yeah do we just continue over that song

620
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:10,330
okay anyway yeah it's just thank you for

621
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:13,180
me it's like that but to me and like

622
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,950
what's interesting more than like our

623
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:19,270
concern just like things that I don't

624
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:21,280
know about they just get like it's a

625
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,750
part of you obviously yeah I don't think

626
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,340
I brush them to the rug at all like I

627
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,710
think I'm pretty open with you like I've

628
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,810
said in the past I think you think about

629
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,150
it a lot more than you think then you

630
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:32,260
speak a lot like you might be processing

631
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,670
it and I think there's certain times

632
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,130
even when I hear you sharing I'm like I

633
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:37,480
think in your mind you're like think you

634
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,920
talk about a lot more because you would

635
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,560
just say little it's like a bit like

636
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,720
little sparse things and I kind of have

637
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,100
to like puzzle piece in there there cuz

638
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,510
it's like one little thing in your head

639
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,550
you have all the details but it's like a

640
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,530
little like tiny little thing that you

641
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,910
say and that's the only thing I hear but

642
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,640
your mind like how do you not know like

643
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,900
I totally said that cuz you say these

644
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,460
little things out of context but it's

645
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,800
like I don't know what's underneath that

646
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,470
you know so you just get little pieces

647
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,520
of things and I have to try to jumble

648
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,350
them together and make my best

649
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,340
assessment of what that means purse is

650
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:11,290
like right okay so that's a lot of

651
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,060
rambling but what is the actual question

652
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:16,000
cuz I guess I don't really understand

653
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,770
what's going on because I'm like if you

654
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:26,230
if you want to ask us it's okay like I

655
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:28,060
said where did that how does that

656
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,180
resolve like there's obviously you still

657
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:34,440
like a uncertainty in you - I'm just

658
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,440
like wondering what that means to you

659
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,920
I mean I was having this conversation

660
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,470
with Nick Palacios just recently like I

661
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,360
think that's why our dynamic is so

662
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,410
unique just because I feel like I found

663
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,810
the perfect partner because you

664
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:52,870
understand we even talked about this I

665
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:57,280
feel like last night just like how in my

666
00:37:52,870 --> 00:38:00,280
experience and I feel like several other

667
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,080
people's experiences like sexuality can

668
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:07,000
be very fluid and it doesn't have to be

669
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,600
like oh you know I'm gay I'm lesbian I'm

670
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,220
bisexual

671
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,870
none of that I'm like no there have just

672
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,330
been certain instances where I'm like

673
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:16,270
attracted to that person and it's caused

674
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:19,270
me not only just like a lot of really

675
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:21,850
fucked up hurt and stuff like that cuz

676
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:24,010
it's just very confusing I knew

677
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:26,800
immediately when I met you I was like oh

678
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,060
I choose this person and I didn't know I

679
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,760
mean for a while I was like maybe I will

680
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:33,190
end up with a woman I was open to that a

681
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,470
long time ago but now after meeting you

682
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,150
it was like I definitely know like you

683
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,400
had me at hello I knew that that wasn't

684
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:41,890
an issue anymore so it's not a matter of

685
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,680
oh well that's dead now it's just like

686
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,600
no I choose you and I would never do

687
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,100
anything to like fuck that up at this

688
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,160
point you know I mean like in the past

689
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,890
there I mean there was so much like it

690
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,740
was so like this with us that that very

691
00:38:53,890 --> 00:39:00,280
much could have been you know a

692
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:02,830
dangerous place to be but I just am so

693
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,060
grateful that God has moved us so long

694
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,970
and we're not there anymore

695
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:09,450
you know just because that's like a very

696
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,450
dark place to be

697
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:29,119
- trust me what do you get okay what do

698
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:38,330
you get from your faith that supports

699
00:39:29,119 --> 00:40:39,339
our relationship what do you get from my

700
00:39:38,330 --> 00:40:39,339
face that's what we share at the core

701
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:56,420
okay

702
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:59,180
what would make you leave me well I mean

703
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:04,010
at this point it have to be something

704
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:06,130
really major but since we're not married

705
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,130
yet

706
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:12,770
and that would be even tougher but I

707
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:18,380
mean at this point I think it would have

708
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:23,500
to be finding out if like you were lying

709
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,500
about stuff I guess

710
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:34,380
yeah I think yeah like if I found out

711
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:38,940
the like you know you're lying about

712
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:42,300
stuff like with Maddie or whatever or I

713
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,530
I don't know right you know which it

714
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,180
would have not stuff from the past

715
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,880
necessarily but it would have to be like

716
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,530
if there was stuff like because I asked

717
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,360
you that just recently you know you're

718
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:57,630
really not an issue and I trust that so

719
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,270
but that or I mean going back to kind of

720
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:04,200
like what I just get so emotional about

721
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:06,270
is just like if you take off and like

722
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,880
you're this like whatever and you've got

723
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,770
this whole career in music and then you

724
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,990
just kind of get lost in it which I

725
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:15,210
don't see you doing at all but you just

726
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:27,450
never know you know so like I mean I

727
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:28,590
again I know you and I know right I mean

728
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,870
I think it's just hard for anybody but

729
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,590
like yeah it has to be something like

730
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,590
wild like that

731
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:59,380
okay who has more power in our

732
00:42:47,750 --> 00:43:03,020
relationship that's a weird question

733
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:05,119
I don't know I think just like with like

734
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:13,599
stronger with strong personalities or

735
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:22,339
something we both have them but gigantic

736
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:24,829
biceps that's why we're this jacket yeah

737
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:29,510
yeah but not like you know not like a

738
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:35,930
domineering way that's good no not like

739
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:42,200
I'm like this no no I think I think just

740
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:44,210
in general like maybe yeah long as

741
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,359
you're cool it's annoying if I would

742
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,770
have said me you're a girl those girls

743
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,180
those women they're like you're strong

744
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,910
independent woman I wear the pants in

745
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,339
the relationship I'm like no please

746
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:58,250
that's a very bizarre for us it looks

747
00:43:55,339 --> 00:44:00,940
better I think yeah you would

748
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:04,579
self-destruct if I wasn't like Carol I

749
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,040
like yielding to like it's like less

750
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:08,960
stressful to like if you want to that's

751
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,640
so weird I'm just traditional Maui and I

752
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,410
watched my mom well I think I'm more

753
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,970
comfortable making decisions and things

754
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,660
at times that's where I knew you're

755
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,660
better at making decisions

756
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,450
the world yeah okay okay

757
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:46,840
what is one experience you wish we never

758
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:48,280
had see that's I mean this is I feel

759
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,020
like this is such a universal question

760
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,580
cuz like everyone would say well oh but

761
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:57,040
this is like how we got here today which

762
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:59,710
is true I would agree cuz I think it's

763
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,360
like what's the one thing I wish you

764
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:04,000
didn't do but it's kind of interesting

765
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,460
questions like what's one experience you

766
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:23,680
wish we never had it's kind of

767
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:26,560
interesting I mean I think yeah I'm like

768
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:33,040
I don't know I mean I wish that we

769
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:36,850
didn't have to experience like you'd

770
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:40,060
like kind of your whole process of like

771
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:42,460
trying to like I don't know like I just

772
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:48,130
we now have to work through so much

773
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:50,110
because of like the past of you not

774
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,490
really being I knew I knew that you

775
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:53,230
loved me and I knew that it wasn't that

776
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,640
you were unsure of me but I think you

777
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:57,580
were maybe unsure of yourself and like

778
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,580
certain things so I think that that just

779
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:02,170
like cause such it's like taking ten

780
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,580
steps back because we had to go there

781
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,660
like we both knew that we loved each

782
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,640
other where you both knew that we would

783
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,150
get to this point but all the shit that

784
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,620
went came with it was just like dating

785
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,960
other people and like it's just like

786
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,950
silly but it's like again it's like

787
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,010
that's kind of an interesting question

788
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:20,850
cuz it's like like

789
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,590
like I wish we could have just taken

790
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:28,040
somewhat of a shortcut in some of it

791
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:28,040
because it's like it was so stupid and

792
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:33,870
it was just like it caused so much pain

793
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:37,160
that like didn't wasn't necessary yeah

794
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:40,770
and now that causes a breach in trust

795
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,950
you know yeah when like if you were to

796
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:46,110
just listened from the beginning it was

797
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:52,860
just like I cut off on like little

798
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:54,720
trails all over the place then but and

799
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,660
then was annoying ironic thing is though

800
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,550
even is that I'm glad you figured it out

801
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,140
with Maddie for a little bit because

802
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:04,230
then I would have still won wondering

803
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,210
now yeah so I'm like I am so freakin

804
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,460
glad that that happened because I was

805
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:11,280
like okay in the background laughing

806
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,960
like I'm so stupid like I know that's

807
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,580
not gonna work but go ahead try just

808
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,030
figure that out like if that's gonna

809
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,650
work

810
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:18,270
I mean it's painful but I'm just glad

811
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,280
that that happened now because I could

812
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,410
not be engaged now not knowing there's

813
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:29,250
no way yeah not a chance

814
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:31,700
yeah I knew that's it oh no I don't all

815
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,700
right

816
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:39,270
well okay what do you wish you could

817
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,630
heal in me and what pain would you take

818
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,580
away

819
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:47,070
hmm I think I wish I oughta sleep ain't

820
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:50,610
about disappointment or you know

821
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:53,040
distrust and even I think some of the

822
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:57,050
stuff you touched on I'm even from my

823
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,050
kids I like things that maybe like

824
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:25,160
even the stuff that you shared when you

825
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:48,349
were in a transition explained you got

826
00:48:25,160 --> 00:49:15,680
heat from both sides against you so to

827
00:48:48,349 --> 00:49:22,940
me that's crazy what's your biggest

828
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:32,720
regret I mean I don't think this even

829
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:37,119
relates to us at all I think I think

830
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:40,220
when I look back at my time of just

831
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,859
speaking of that whole thing of just my

832
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:45,380
time of self exploration and figuring

833
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:49,309
out who I was and all of those things I

834
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:52,369
think that I just don't I was just like

835
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:54,049
yeah like I'd every pride and just like

836
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:56,960
so open about it

837
00:49:54,049 --> 00:50:02,299
that I look back now older as an adult

838
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:05,540
or as a more mature adult now because I

839
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:09,349
wasn't it open to technically um and I

840
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:10,819
just regret now seeing what other

841
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:13,130
parents have to go through with their

842
00:50:10,819 --> 00:50:15,650
kids like all they want is the best for

843
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,849
their children so I think for my parents

844
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:20,000
it was just a huge slap in the face

845
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:21,460
because instead of doing my best to

846
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,990
communicate

847
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:26,410
kind of what I was going through I think

848
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:29,440
I just was like honestly if you aren't

849
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:31,030
with this than by and just like shut

850
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,730
them out for four years which obviously

851
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:37,240
is now not the case but still I just

852
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:39,940
feel like that's like you know I don't

853
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,290
really you know I'm not the type but

854
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,570
like that's one thing that I look back

855
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,680
now and I go oh that was someone mature

856
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:48,610
just yeah like I should have been a

857
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:50,470
little bit more sensitive to that and I

858
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,420
see other people doing it now and that's

859
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,590
been a unique experience for me to be

860
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,640
like hey but like think about your

861
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:57,640
parents like I know that they're not

862
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,050
trying to like be mean they just want

863
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,310
the best for you and that is scary for

864
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,110
your daughter too now and just be kind

865
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:07,000
of confused to suit to she is sexually

866
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:10,120
so I think yeah just not every gret not

867
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,430
I think I did try and communicate I

868
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,830
don't know it's just like such a

869
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:18,210
interesting thing but I think at least

870
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:29,070
being a little bit more respectful yeah

871
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:29,070
instead of just putting all over okay

872
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,150
are we good

873
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:43,780
what do you think is the biggest

874
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:45,850
challenge of our relationship you really

875
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:49,330
do I know that's kind of a similar

876
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:51,790
question that we have um do you think

877
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:55,120
the biggest yeah I think that was very

878
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:57,550
similar I guess I could reiterate it

879
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:01,120
though I think the biggest challenge of

880
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:03,130
our relationship is that both of us and

881
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,740
this is different answer to I think both

882
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:08,350
of us have such a strong faith and have

883
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:13,530
such a strong commitment to like that

884
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:15,670
but also I think we both have similar

885
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,380
points of empathy for people have

886
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,390
nothing to do with that which is like

887
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,160
we're kind of bridges I think in certain

888
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:22,960
ways where we've kind of fallen into I

889
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,850
would never like label myself that but

890
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,290
it just seems like where we are like you

891
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,510
know working so heavily in the music

892
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:29,860
industry now and you working in like

893
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,440
you know the industry as well in

894
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:37,660
different facets and like it just seems

895
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:39,520
like we have like two very sometimes can

896
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,450
be very polar opposites worlds you know

897
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,030
what I mean they seem like it almost

898
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,980
like nemesis or something like that but

899
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:47,140
we're kind of uniquely displaced like in

900
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,600
both it just kind of happened that way

901
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,730
and I think we we both have an

902
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,370
understanding of these very different

903
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:56,440
paradigms and I think that will be a

904
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:59,440
that's a really beautiful thing because

905
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,870
I'll always err on the side of like and

906
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:05,110
you total you on the like humanity and

907
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:08,140
just people like you know just being

908
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:10,390
humans and all the good stuff but you

909
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:14,110
know a challenge could be like there are

910
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:16,200
very very bold very clear statements in

911
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,580
our faith that sometimes like to buy

912
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,660
those people that we may be like shake

913
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,760
hands with you know and like have

914
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,660
different yeah it works with so I think

915
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,940
that could be a challenge in our

916
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,910
relationship as we go on is there might

917
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,950
be like different opinions about who we

918
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:31,900
are and what we're about Oh from both

919
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:34,150
sides and I think that's just like that

920
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:36,400
is what it is it's just people that will

921
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:41,200
probably be a challenge now in probably

922
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,510
forever is what it is yeah a good thing

923
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:51,400
I don't think either of us struggle with

924
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:54,510
having opinions okay here we go last but

925
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,510
not least for you Oh

926
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:17,460
read yours what are the next steps in

927
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:22,650
our relationship

928
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,650
well next big step in our relationship

929
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:27,340
that's definitely a big step and the

930
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,800
little steps leading up into that would

931
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:33,250
just be like thinking in a more peaceful

932
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,020
place like living lies and you know

933
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:38,230
planning all that stuff out but that's a

934
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:40,030
big step and then I think our careers to

935
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:41,460
you know really being catalyst for each

936
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:44,230
other anything at what that looks like

937
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,520
and where we're gonna like melt together

938
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:46,870
and help each other you know in

939
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,410
different areas I think that's those

940
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:51,790
career careers and obviously marriage

941
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:58,210
whatever order that comes in seems like

942
00:54:51,790 --> 00:55:01,480
they're kind of in parallel babies a lot

943
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:08,530
a lot of kids you're gonna change your

944
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:11,530
mind when you see when you see like the

945
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:13,180
first child you're gonna be like I'm not

946
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,670
doing this service of the world if I

947
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:19,810
don't make more of these little suckers

948
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:23,740
you know like just - yeah - good more

949
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:24,670
food just say some people are families I

950
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,840
want a militia

951
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:31,420
I want a little army okay you can have

952
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:37,950
like our own soccer team got nice to her

953
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:37,950
own school that's not the point

954
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:52,960
what oh here's one okay what are maybe

955
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:57,160
two or three things what some advice if

956
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:01,180
I were to be a better man for you and

957
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:04,300
better you know partner what are like

958
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:06,960
two or three things like bits of advice

959
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:20,369
you can give me to be better for you

960
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:22,650
I think I mean truthfully jeez I feel so

961
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:25,170
fucking blessed because like probably

962
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:31,260
like I hit the jackpot because I think

963
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:33,119
that you are just I feel badly for other

964
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,859
people honestly almost in every

965
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,220
relationship cuz I'm like most men are

966
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:42,690
not like you so I feel like you already

967
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:45,930
your mind is like way up here and like

968
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:47,700
most men are just like like oh my god so

969
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:53,670
annoying they know because I found out

970
00:56:47,700 --> 00:57:00,809
much later we weren't dating whoever you

971
00:56:53,670 --> 00:57:03,540
dated anyway but I think so I just want

972
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:07,290
to like obviously highlight that because

973
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:08,940
I think that I'm I think I think we've

974
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,859
talked about this to like you know you

975
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,900
are in the right relationship when you

976
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:14,130
need to feel lucky to have each other

977
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,170
but I definitely am like no I'm the

978
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:19,140
lucky one for sure just because you're

979
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:20,400
so like understanding and stuff and just

980
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,599
emotionally intelligent like that's a

981
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,309
real thing and I think that a lot of

982
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:27,030
people don't know what that is and they

983
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:28,170
don't exercise that and run towards it

984
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:31,440
and that's something I mean obviously

985
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:33,000
and even this type of setting I always

986
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,020
know that you're gonna be by my side and

987
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,520
like we always challenge you know

988
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:43,079
expanding our minds and that means like

989
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:46,440
really cool but I think I mean just

990
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:48,540
again like working on you know which we

991
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,730
are already but just being sensitive and

992
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:52,079
like different things that like you may

993
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:54,030
I don't need you to understand

994
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,040
necessarily but just if I'm

995
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:58,680
communicating like hey that that really

996
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,750
upsets me or whatever just being like oh

997
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,369
really sensitive to the point where you

998
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,869
feel nauseated just because you're like

999
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:06,480
oh my gosh this is so stupid I hate

1000
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:07,710
having to be like like baby her but

1001
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,510
there's certain things I'm like I don't

1002
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:12,480
care if you don't get why it that's me

1003
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:15,990
but it does so just like from the for

1004
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,190
okay I'm so sorry like instead of just

1005
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,390
being like it's not a big deal

1006
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:21,150
I'm like no it is

1007
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:23,160
and vice-versa I can take that on myself

1008
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:37,100
but yeah I don't think they maybe be

1009
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:39,750
more sensitive I think just continuing

1010
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,510
like I've said this before but always

1011
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:45,630
just like being the leader spiritually

1012
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:52,260
because I think I need that I think

1013
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:53,700
you're a lot more spiritually I don't

1014
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,400
know how exactly for that I just know

1015
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,200
that what I see for my partner like the

1016
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,800
ideal partner for me is someone that's

1017
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:05,490
just constantly challenging me in my

1018
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,590
walk with God and just like initiate

1019
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,910
like I agree with you and you've said

1020
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,290
this in the past like that has to be

1021
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:12,270
something that like you want to do on

1022
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:15,030
your own which I do and I feel so

1023
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:17,550
grateful that God has like gotten ahold

1024
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:20,160
of my heart and I do seek that but as my

1025
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:22,140
partner and a leader of my home and my

1026
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,140
future family like I just always want

1027
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,850
you to be the one that's like hey you

1028
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,080
know its prey or like hey like they're

1029
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,970
just little things like that and like

1030
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,740
let's start our morning devotional like

1031
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:35,160
all those things that like I definitely

1032
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:37,890
want for us I think if you were the one

1033
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:47,850
leaving that I would get like excited

1034
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:49,160
about that okay that's great I think it

1035
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:52,110
could be something to not do as well

1036
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:56,400
yeah okay well here's one so I think

1037
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:58,290
just like you know I think I'm just

1038
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,530
being sensitive to the fact that like I

1039
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:03,360
mean and I I relate to this too but I

1040
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:06,390
guess it's different because it's coming

1041
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:10,620
from a different dynamic but you're just

1042
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:11,910
a very friendly guy and I think we've

1043
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,990
talked about this in the past my dad's

1044
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:17,520
very friendly he was in the

1045
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:19,620
entertainment business as well but never

1046
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,080
letting anyone confuse that for you

1047
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:24,330
flirting because I don't want any eyes

1048
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,920
on any side whether it's that female

1049
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,780
thinking that you're flirting because

1050
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,130
we're being too friendly or whether it's

1051
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,109
other people in the room

1052
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:34,859
thinking that that's the case just

1053
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:36,480
because that's like so frustrating so I

1054
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:38,579
think just oh and I think you are really

1055
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,309
good about that definitely but just

1056
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:43,109
again in the future like oh just like

1057
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:44,819
around so many different thing and we

1058
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:47,910
both are so I'm taking this unlike

1059
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:50,009
reciprocating and we're both mirrors but

1060
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:53,819
I think just like making sure that could

1061
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:55,490
never be taken wrong ever you know what

1062
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:57,809
I mean mm-hmm

1063
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,730
even like respectful in the fact like no

1064
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:00,630
number like nothing like just even like

1065
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,019
what kinda what we talked about the

1066
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,299
other day

1067
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:04,500
just like talk to linen about it cuz

1068
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:05,970
that's the more respectful thing to do

1069
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,740
it's hard because we're like young and

1070
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:09,740
in LA and like networking and all those

1071
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:12,269
things but like I just think it's tough

1072
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:15,410
because that can be taken so wrong like

1073
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:17,579
oh yeah like let me text it like I just

1074
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:19,849
it's a tough thing but I think that

1075
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:19,849
that's
