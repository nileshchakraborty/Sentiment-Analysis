0:00:32.439,0:00:43.750
when you think about the first time we

0:00:34.239,0:00:47.950
met what do you remember you know I

0:00:43.750,0:00:50.290
don't think about that time which

0:00:47.950,0:00:54.370
obviously wasn't the first time that we

0:00:50.290,0:00:56.290
met but I think about being at Briggs

0:00:54.370,0:01:00.210
apartment

0:00:56.290,0:01:08.259
and you were on the phone with Laura

0:01:00.210,0:01:10.810
waking up to you uh-huh you know yeah I

0:01:08.259,0:01:13.810
don't know it was my first like I'm not

0:01:10.810,0:01:24.160
like bummin might do it I want to get

0:01:13.810,0:01:27.450
kissing you know at times I do know is

0:01:24.160,0:01:27.450
the answer yeah

0:01:47.150,0:01:52.340
what do you cherish about our time

0:01:49.560,0:01:52.340
together as a couple

0:01:55.550,0:02:09.869
see I for those who are just joining the

0:02:07.770,0:02:12.720
kind of traditions that you might have

0:02:09.869,0:02:18.540
to do together those are those things

0:02:12.720,0:02:20.550
that you know I miss and I think about

0:02:18.540,0:02:24.390
when I think about like what's a it's a

0:02:20.550,0:02:30.120
good relationship these special things

0:02:24.390,0:02:34.940
that you develop along the years can

0:02:30.120,0:02:34.940
really just it becomes a language

0:02:50.600,0:03:19.670
yeah these are some nice what's your

0:03:14.790,0:03:19.670
fondest memory from our time together

0:03:30.890,0:03:33.940
I'm gonna cry

0:03:34.430,0:03:42.250
there was a night when I was in the

0:03:38.780,0:03:42.250
apartment with Rebecca and was done

0:03:44.990,0:03:53.610
we were in kind of a rough patch but you

0:03:49.260,0:03:58.020
came over and slow dance with me and my

0:03:53.610,0:04:06.780
feet and do you remember this at all and

0:03:58.020,0:04:09.540
we listened to Lake guy that was a

0:04:06.780,0:04:11.810
marshes do you know we're talking about

0:04:09.540,0:04:11.810
yeah

0:04:12.810,0:04:19.530
[Music]

0:04:14.900,0:04:27.780
yes and you helped me he danced with me

0:04:19.530,0:04:30.200
and we stood for a long time and it was

0:04:27.780,0:04:30.200
a tough time

0:04:40.310,0:04:51.330
what moment or we the closest say New

0:04:45.180,0:04:56.490
York yeah I just thought about kind of

0:04:51.330,0:05:00.479
what my fondest memory was and I loved

0:04:56.490,0:05:03.210
doing Valentine's Day with you yeah

0:05:00.479,0:05:05.279
and then you know following that I loved

0:05:03.210,0:05:08.419
like the way we did birthdays together

0:05:05.279,0:05:19.039
it loves the way we did things together

0:05:08.419,0:05:26.460
I remember that night in Woodside and

0:05:19.039,0:05:27.689
the word damn I was doing something I

0:05:26.460,0:05:31.409
think I was just going to work like

0:05:27.689,0:05:34.710
catering and a weird hiding such a great

0:05:31.409,0:05:40.169
night together and so you walked meeting

0:05:34.710,0:05:40.390
to the subway and remember like right at

0:05:40.169,0:05:43.519
that moment

0:05:40.390,0:05:43.519
[Music]

0:05:46.140,0:05:53.120
I some concept some things to be

0:05:48.900,0:05:59.450
effective I could marry you right now

0:05:53.120,0:06:01.400
and you said well to propose I'd say yes

0:05:59.450,0:06:04.410
thank you

0:06:01.400,0:06:07.970
and I'm just that it's kind of nice that

0:06:04.410,0:06:52.250
I had to walk away

0:06:07.970,0:06:52.250
think about that change

0:07:14.360,0:07:34.210
I'm glad that happened the way it

0:07:18.379,0:07:37.909
happened now you know back then I I

0:07:34.210,0:07:40.310
think there were trust issues I know

0:07:37.909,0:07:42.110
there were a little just issues and I

0:07:40.310,0:07:49.849
blame you for a lot of things but I

0:07:42.110,0:07:52.280
wasn't perfect and we were young and so

0:07:49.849,0:07:56.270
most of me wants to say just fidelity

0:07:52.280,0:08:01.340
even though we didn't I don't know

0:07:56.270,0:08:05.199
exactly what you did I felt like I want

0:08:01.340,0:08:08.360
to say that I would change that but oh

0:08:05.199,0:08:12.830
my god brought together you know I guess

0:08:08.360,0:08:14.419
I wouldn't be the person I am today and

0:08:12.830,0:08:19.699
you wouldn't have the relationship that

0:08:14.419,0:08:22.699
we do now if it were any different do

0:08:19.699,0:08:30.110
you know so yeah I want to say our

0:08:22.699,0:08:31.880
faithfulness and I want to say because

0:08:30.110,0:08:34.479
they loved each other we were so in love

0:08:31.880,0:08:34.479
with each other

0:08:39.380,0:08:49.320
but people make mistakes and so I can't

0:08:44.850,0:08:53.970
really pinpoint exactly how to say that

0:08:49.320,0:08:55.380
but I wish it well I think we were

0:08:53.970,0:08:59.010
committed I don't think that we were

0:08:55.380,0:09:01.080
faithful really think that I put a lot

0:08:59.010,0:09:03.120
of pain in between us

0:09:01.080,0:09:04.950
stuff that I couldn't get over stuff

0:09:03.120,0:09:09.120
that took me years the over even after

0:09:04.950,0:09:17.960
we stop doing stuff that still hurts

0:09:09.120,0:09:22.500
mm-hmm yeah it's just like transitions

0:09:17.960,0:09:28.370
that we do to change the limits for why

0:09:22.500,0:09:36.210
I wonder what you're saying is uh I

0:09:28.370,0:09:38.370
don't know why it's still I mean I'm

0:09:36.210,0:09:44.540
like like continually like David just

0:09:38.370,0:09:46.410
continually know things it and like

0:09:44.540,0:09:50.270
relationships I've had sensitive people

0:09:46.410,0:09:53.790
just like trusted she is about mm-hmm

0:09:50.270,0:09:55.350
you know I wanted to marry you and like

0:09:53.790,0:09:56.810
I don't think after I wouldn't do that

0:09:55.350,0:10:01.680
again

0:09:56.810,0:10:05.540
this is real heavy shit but it's a

0:10:01.680,0:10:05.540
really scary place to be in

0:10:09.740,0:10:16.280
yes

0:10:11.090,0:10:16.280
no I'll an experience

0:10:17.460,0:10:20.629
[Music]

0:10:31.380,0:11:30.550
I would have to okay what was the first

0:11:29.050,0:11:32.940
moment you realized our relationship

0:11:30.550,0:11:32.940
would end

0:11:48.230,0:11:55.340
when we first started dating you know I

0:11:52.070,0:11:57.650
was still getting never watch and I

0:11:55.340,0:11:59.840
never really allowed myself to I didn't

0:11:57.650,0:12:12.200
know how to oh that would be something

0:11:59.840,0:12:13.850
how much is that what just I think it

0:12:12.200,0:12:16.760
sucked that you make that conversation

0:12:13.850,0:12:18.170
about sleeping next and then that's a

0:12:16.760,0:12:26.510
morning that sucks

0:12:18.170,0:12:29.360
yes what I didn't know how to do was

0:12:26.510,0:12:33.410
start liking somebody at that point I'd

0:12:29.360,0:12:36.680
like to yeah but I'm still what I

0:12:33.410,0:12:45.260
thought in love with something like that

0:12:36.680,0:12:47.330
I kind of necessarily even and and kind

0:12:45.260,0:12:52.550
of it just has so fucking long for me to

0:12:47.330,0:12:56.860
realize that what we had been creating

0:12:52.550,0:12:56.860
was something more stronger

0:13:04.160,0:13:12.870
but but I remember in like as they were

0:13:10.080,0:13:15.840
starting to date that it wasn't a

0:13:12.870,0:13:22.020
relationship that would necessarily last

0:13:15.840,0:13:24.470
because I hadn't I wasn't you know I see

0:13:22.020,0:13:24.470
were so

0:13:27.600,0:13:43.560
I was I just mind to like you went

0:13:40.050,0:13:54.870
through me too and so I was here ready

0:13:43.560,0:13:58.790
to tackle the issue I'm sorry was there

0:13:54.870,0:13:58.790
a specific point

0:14:05.500,0:14:13.680
yeah

0:14:07.579,0:14:17.550
I remember when my dad came inside knows

0:14:13.680,0:14:21.629
it was Carolina and we don't be like

0:14:17.550,0:14:25.319
this speaking over the phone and it was

0:14:21.629,0:14:28.709
great and I remember when I finally open

0:14:25.319,0:14:30.540
up the computer like you to get bras to

0:14:28.709,0:14:34.100
do so they sent to the person much like

0:14:30.540,0:14:44.759
the spherical mounts and I remember

0:14:34.100,0:14:47.569
looking at the view it just it seemed

0:14:44.759,0:14:53.930
there's just a huge distance between

0:14:47.569,0:14:53.930
what was so mean

0:14:55.420,0:15:03.990
I don't know how our name is Spencer

0:14:58.470,0:15:03.990
thinks even though that your nearest

0:15:06.520,0:15:10.800
you're great Zoomers

0:15:29.790,0:15:42.860
who decided that relationship would end

0:15:33.120,0:15:45.970
how do you feel about it now even and I

0:15:42.860,0:15:45.970
[Music]

0:15:46.860,0:15:52.390
was depressed free even through my

0:15:50.410,0:15:55.470
religion to the Tyler just like I'm

0:15:52.390,0:16:00.150
trying to make latch onto something that

0:15:55.470,0:16:04.560
felt anywhere near what we had you know

0:16:00.150,0:16:09.720
that wasn't how I feel about it in helm

0:16:04.560,0:16:11.280
I'm really glad that it about it because

0:16:09.720,0:16:14.460
I love you you want to make favorite

0:16:11.280,0:16:16.680
people I'm like yeah again it took us in

0:16:14.460,0:16:24.540
a couple of years to get back on track

0:16:16.680,0:16:27.810
but you're my best friends five years a

0:16:24.540,0:16:29.580
long time in us yeah and I think that if

0:16:27.810,0:16:33.450
I can I thought about it a couple times

0:16:29.580,0:16:40.110
since we broke up but I think if we

0:16:33.450,0:16:47.730
would have held on it was just nonsense

0:16:40.110,0:16:49.290
you know how long but it just you don't

0:16:47.730,0:16:53.330
have the courage to do it even though I

0:16:49.290,0:16:53.330
was extremely heartbroken but

0:17:01.100,0:17:05.589
[Applause]

0:17:02.640,0:17:07.720
hi oh we wanted to tell this question

0:17:05.589,0:17:31.930
what would you warn my next boyfriend

0:17:07.720,0:17:38.860
about me yeah yeah I think that yeah at

0:17:31.930,0:17:50.020
that point you just started yelling at

0:17:38.860,0:17:57.220
me and there was no reason for it that's

0:17:50.020,0:17:58.960
like not really a big thing I mean a lot

0:17:57.220,0:18:01.510
of things I think the relationship kind

0:17:58.960,0:18:04.810
of wanted to hear what people might

0:18:01.510,0:18:06.460
dislike it's crazy I mean I don't think

0:18:04.810,0:18:21.270
that you were all that raising something

0:18:06.460,0:18:21.270
to give it a little like that sometimes

0:18:22.460,0:18:25.589
[Music]

0:18:29.360,0:18:32.560

0:19:41.620,0:19:54.710
okay you're really awesome and our

0:19:48.620,0:19:57.800
relationship to sound really smart you

0:19:54.710,0:20:00.410
are really smart you do even an emails

0:19:57.800,0:20:03.140
to me currently you don't talk to me

0:20:00.410,0:20:05.960
like a friend you talk to me like an

0:20:03.140,0:20:08.350
employer or like so you know like it's

0:20:05.960,0:20:08.350
interesting

0:20:15.190,0:20:27.620
but we were bolstering like so I think

0:20:17.660,0:20:29.480
that really like you you need a

0:20:27.620,0:20:36.820
girlfriend that's gonna laugh at every

0:20:29.480,0:20:36.820
joke they make which is not a bad thing

0:20:42.220,0:21:12.710
I still think something back in no cuz

0:20:47.180,0:21:31.480
I'm like does that sound bitchy no I

0:21:12.710,0:21:31.480
think okay like we're not anymore

0:21:34.990,0:21:43.730
you're totally still little or for two

0:21:37.640,0:21:49.160
years I'm busy and yeah that's in this

0:21:43.730,0:21:51.980
room with me I only say that no Zach

0:21:49.160,0:21:54.340
said that I will kiss it in person did

0:21:51.980,0:21:54.340
say that

0:22:48.759,0:22:57.109
yeah who is at fault for the

0:22:53.869,0:23:03.009
relationship ending I think me

0:22:57.109,0:23:07.309
really definitely absolutely 100%

0:23:03.009,0:23:12.769
because I think I was the one I remain

0:23:07.309,0:23:16.700
the most mistakes and and you always

0:23:12.769,0:23:19.489
gave me another chance and so sometimes

0:23:16.700,0:23:21.499
i battle between whether or not that was

0:23:19.489,0:23:26.690
the right decision for me or if that was

0:23:21.499,0:23:28.849
a weak decision for anything and if

0:23:26.690,0:23:31.639
there was a weak decision then I think

0:23:28.849,0:23:34.309
that it's still me because I was you

0:23:31.639,0:23:37.309
know I'm okay well you shouldn't but I

0:23:34.309,0:23:43.460
think it was I think I was all my fault

0:23:37.309,0:23:48.920
I think that I probably you definitely

0:23:43.460,0:23:54.210
definitely deserved

0:23:48.920,0:24:01.130
like a you know like a second chance

0:23:54.210,0:24:01.130
after whatever that guy's name was

0:24:03.429,0:24:08.409
because you'd given me something so I

0:24:05.710,0:24:17.429
just felt like I really wasn't there I

0:24:08.409,0:24:17.429
don't feel like I was there you know

0:24:37.400,0:24:54.020
surprising right

0:24:49.800,0:24:54.020
however that was the last thing that

0:24:54.440,0:25:03.240
that's saying I feel terrible for if you

0:25:01.290,0:25:05.010
just now went through the last two years

0:25:03.240,0:25:11.190
thinking that you're the one that's at

0:25:05.010,0:25:27.600
fall that's fucking stupid because

0:25:11.190,0:25:33.300
that's that's oh you thought because I

0:25:27.600,0:25:37.190
was still living in green housing and

0:25:33.300,0:25:40.590

0:27:09.399,0:27:15.620
trying to think with all that entails

0:27:12.350,0:27:16.549
we had a great sex life even when we

0:27:15.620,0:27:26.500
were mad at each other

0:27:16.549,0:27:29.690
oh yeah yeah yeah you make me feel good

0:27:26.500,0:27:31.929
here yeah this is good you were you're a

0:27:29.690,0:27:31.929
great

0:27:38.779,0:27:43.289
did you give me like a questionnaire

0:27:41.190,0:27:44.820
did you like breakdown things about our

0:27:43.289,0:27:47.820
relations I did I filled out the

0:27:44.820,0:27:49.850
question if they use this oh I didn't do

0:27:47.820,0:27:49.850
that

0:27:51.980,0:27:56.419
why did you cheat on you so many times

0:27:59.539,0:28:20.039
or why so many times I didn't cheat on

0:28:12.000,0:28:34.220
you so many times I did not like do the

0:28:20.039,0:28:34.220
act of cheating oh yes

0:28:35.240,0:28:40.230
that sucks

0:28:37.169,0:28:43.909
see I'm still upset about it I know but

0:28:40.230,0:28:43.909
hey I never slept with anybody else

0:28:45.769,0:28:49.610
that's fucking gross man

0:28:50.659,0:28:55.580
that's cheating

0:28:52.320,0:28:58.730
I never said it wasn't I just said that

0:28:55.580,0:29:02.760
you know I feel like the question

0:28:58.730,0:29:07.110
implies that I did so many things so

0:29:02.760,0:29:08.730
many times and I didn't I did like I

0:29:07.110,0:29:10.230
would say a few - when you sit when

0:29:08.730,0:29:15.809
something says so many times that

0:29:10.230,0:29:18.120
implies like sex well I was the only

0:29:15.809,0:29:23.850
give you a clear understanding maybe of

0:29:18.120,0:29:32.059
what you don't know the question is why

0:29:23.850,0:29:35.059
did I and I think it's because I was

0:29:32.059,0:29:35.059
interested

0:29:35.630,0:29:39.590
and our Russians

0:29:41.730,0:29:43.730
ah

0:29:46.120,0:29:49.590
why didn't you under with me

0:29:53.700,0:30:04.560
that's right after I look that that

0:30:00.190,0:30:09.810
night that it all kind of first started

0:30:04.560,0:30:12.370
we didn't do anything we talked and then

0:30:09.810,0:30:14.470
about two weeks later I broke up with

0:30:12.370,0:30:20.770
you because I felt like I had been

0:30:14.470,0:30:23.980
dishonest and then that's when something

0:30:20.770,0:30:28.960
happened and then you and I talked about

0:30:23.980,0:30:43.540
it a month later and then we got back

0:30:28.960,0:30:46.450
together I started nearly I feel like

0:30:43.540,0:30:48.040
sometimes I feel like I try to do it the

0:30:46.450,0:30:56.110
best way and sometimes I feel like it

0:30:48.040,0:30:58.680
just a nice no take the salt for at all

0:30:56.110,0:30:58.680
like

0:31:01.320,0:31:06.230
and I think it's kind of weird not weird

0:31:07.400,0:31:14.460
it's it's you know when you ask when you

0:31:10.980,0:31:19.200
say like every time we're in college you

0:31:14.460,0:31:25.170
know you have one way of kind of talking

0:31:19.200,0:31:27.920
about it as you know as we're really

0:31:25.170,0:31:27.920
talking about

0:31:38.680,0:31:42.420
why did I give so much sense

0:31:49.190,0:31:52.289
[Music]

0:32:12.460,0:32:15.960
yeah I don't have dancers

0:32:27.740,0:32:57.530
it looks the one thing I should have

0:32:29.940,0:32:59.580
time to save the relationship one thing

0:32:57.530,0:33:02.390
you could have done in the things

0:32:59.580,0:33:02.390
relationship

0:33:12.200,0:33:21.270
get your dick in your pants

0:33:14.400,0:33:21.809
I don't know I don't think that was the

0:33:21.270,0:33:30.360
problem

0:33:21.809,0:33:36.240
my dick was like everywhere Christ

0:33:30.360,0:33:38.760
what's I don't know I don't know I don't

0:33:36.240,0:33:48.740
think they're this is my question

0:33:38.760,0:33:55.290
okay I don't think there's anything I

0:33:48.740,0:33:58.200
honestly like we talked about sticks

0:33:55.290,0:34:00.860
with me and there's a doozy so there's a

0:33:58.200,0:34:00.860
list and

0:34:09.240,0:34:14.250
all right wait because I don't know I

0:34:11.899,0:34:15.929
don't think I could save it I don't

0:34:14.250,0:34:19.409
think that's the rule that I was playing

0:34:15.929,0:34:23.580
I don't think that I don't think the

0:34:19.409,0:34:41.720
other thing like bill I got I don't

0:34:23.580,0:34:41.720
think that was the case I mean I agree

0:34:43.580,0:34:52.649
more with them why do you want to still

0:34:47.790,0:34:55.399
be friends those break up because I

0:34:52.649,0:34:55.399
really miss you

0:35:06.540,0:35:11.240
it's like you know and that's also just

0:35:09.480,0:35:17.150
who I am

0:35:11.240,0:35:21.869
right I really just

0:35:17.150,0:35:25.680
I'm sure there's like deep psychological

0:35:21.869,0:35:31.320
issues with me where I don't want to

0:35:25.680,0:35:36.150
feel like maybe like not like there's

0:35:31.320,0:35:42.050
something which is why which is why I

0:35:36.150,0:35:42.050
wanted to continue friendships with exes

0:35:42.200,0:35:49.680
but I'm all I mean forever for the most

0:35:45.900,0:35:54.990
part the people that you know were maybe

0:35:49.680,0:36:01.700
people that were not very ugly so you

0:35:54.990,0:36:01.700
know water like I don't talk to them and

0:36:01.850,0:36:15.619
but I still talk to you you're wonderful

0:36:15.740,0:36:25.700
just pure joy you know you said to me

0:36:27.080,0:36:34.920
has fuckin haunts me you said to me that

0:36:32.220,0:36:38.910
I will never find somebody that loves

0:36:34.920,0:36:42.869
you the way that you love me but you

0:36:38.910,0:36:43.880
love me the most and you said that

0:36:42.869,0:36:45.869
tonight

0:36:43.880,0:36:55.960
several times

0:36:45.869,0:36:57.940
and it's like every year so - so far

0:36:55.960,0:37:01.240
that's gone by it like I said only

0:36:57.940,0:37:05.980
continue yeah anything else - but I

0:37:01.240,0:37:09.250
think - yeah maybe we're coming up on

0:37:05.980,0:37:11.260
three but each one that goes by I start

0:37:09.250,0:37:19.390
thinking you might be right

0:37:11.260,0:37:21.609
you might be right fucking alone I think

0:37:19.390,0:37:26.140
it's there I mean I like it

0:37:21.609,0:37:35.049
like I'm not complaining I just better

0:37:26.140,0:37:46.329
this year and so that's why I want you

0:37:35.049,0:37:50.099
so many friends how can you look me in

0:37:46.329,0:37:50.099
the eyes after I broke your trust

0:37:55.420,0:38:13.880
do they love you it's like it's really

0:37:58.700,0:38:17.300
simple I know that and I still love them

0:38:13.880,0:38:21.710
I don't know we hit somewhere along the

0:38:17.300,0:38:29.420
road we hit something right I always

0:38:21.710,0:38:31.220
want you to be in my life and how can

0:38:29.420,0:38:35.290
you look me in the eyes I started to do

0:38:31.220,0:38:35.290
shots yeah

0:38:35.470,0:38:42.820
you know even though a lot of what

0:38:38.180,0:38:42.820
happened it's really shitty

0:38:47.299,0:38:57.380
yeah there was a question but that

0:38:51.740,0:39:04.619
horrible wretched human being of a girl

0:38:57.380,0:39:05.970
asked me which was why why can't why you

0:39:04.619,0:39:15.950
want to be friends with me even though

0:39:05.970,0:39:15.950
it was he you know did it to that girl

0:39:16.039,0:39:21.720
anyway see even though it seems like

0:39:18.450,0:39:24.750
there's still like deep deep down you're

0:39:21.720,0:39:26.910
still anger there anyway but it was easy

0:39:24.750,0:39:31.589
for me because you don't need me think

0:39:26.910,0:39:39.779
to me that you do you know like you're

0:39:31.589,0:39:43.380
this NAT but we venture shit and you

0:39:39.779,0:39:48.410
know me and I know you I know really who

0:39:43.380,0:39:48.410
you are and that's more important

0:39:50.090,0:40:01.520
do you think that this friendship will

0:39:54.700,0:40:06.130
continue I mean seems like your new

0:40:01.520,0:40:14.650
boyfriend is a little bit possessive or

0:40:06.130,0:40:17.500
insecure and I was really excited to

0:40:14.650,0:40:20.780
hang out at you like six months ago

0:40:17.500,0:40:25.040
like rediscover a friendship since then

0:40:20.780,0:40:31.210
I don't feel like you've always been

0:40:25.040,0:40:37.670
able to and feel like do you think that

0:40:31.210,0:40:41.500
this experience that we went through is

0:40:37.670,0:40:41.500
it do you think in any way that kind of

0:40:41.890,0:40:48.350
informs you now how to like really tears

0:40:45.700,0:40:51.530
Jessie but all you know all the student

0:40:48.350,0:40:54.200
that we went through all this shit that

0:40:51.530,0:40:56.150
we went through being in a relationship

0:40:54.200,0:40:58.040
maybe talking to Exodus you know that

0:40:56.150,0:41:00.200
always being kind uncomfortable and now

0:40:58.040,0:41:01.670
you and I are exes but we're developing

0:41:00.200,0:41:04.400
a friendship and you're in a

0:41:01.670,0:41:14.780
relationship and sometimes it seems like

0:41:04.400,0:41:16.780
he's not comfortable talking to me but

0:41:14.780,0:41:28.820
we work together for a really long time

0:41:16.780,0:41:30.320
and I don't know I agree with you but

0:41:28.820,0:41:32.570
there's always gonna be something

0:41:30.320,0:41:34.970
between us excellent not more than the

0:41:32.570,0:41:36.640
friends but it's gonna be more than

0:41:34.970,0:41:42.040
friends

0:41:36.640,0:41:42.040
just some guy I dated for six months

0:41:42.190,0:41:48.340
passed and he knows that and so I think

0:41:50.140,0:41:57.310
yeah he is he's kind of possessive and

0:41:52.820,0:41:57.310
he's kind of insecure but I think he's

0:41:57.430,0:42:04.040
doing okay dude but I mean like even I

0:42:02.180,0:42:08.780
mean he's not gonna stop you from coming

0:42:04.040,0:42:11.300
here today but he's unhappy with it yeah

0:42:08.780,0:42:15.130
something's not like super happy that on

0:42:11.300,0:42:20.470

0:42:55.220,0:43:04.060
just all the good things about the

0:42:56.750,0:43:04.060
relationship - the you know sexual

0:43:17.650,0:43:22.859
what do you resent about our time

0:43:49.420,0:44:07.930

0:43:52.540,0:44:12.760
like hate you for thinking has done

0:44:07.930,0:44:15.850
anything you know I feel about the

0:44:12.760,0:44:19.170
decisions that they made but I wouldn't

0:44:15.850,0:44:19.170
call it was done right

0:44:19.180,0:44:30.990
cuz again I'm glad it all happened I

0:44:22.020,0:44:30.990
learned a lot a lot even

0:44:35.330,0:44:46.370
learned a lot I was seriously depressed

0:44:38.630,0:44:48.110
yeah for a long time but that person on

0:44:46.370,0:44:49.960
my home which was something I've never

0:44:48.110,0:44:55.880
had to deal with and realizing like a

0:44:49.960,0:44:57.980
serial monogamist in this crazy his

0:44:55.880,0:44:59.390
sirens yeah because that your Titan I

0:44:57.980,0:45:02.120
broke up and before Matt and I got

0:44:59.390,0:45:04.700
together I finally had a couple months

0:45:02.120,0:45:09.320
only to like be alone that used to scare

0:45:04.700,0:45:13.460
me but like I solidly loved it

0:45:09.320,0:45:15.170
so the point wondering like I'm 26

0:45:13.460,0:45:17.930
living in New York City it was fun and

0:45:15.170,0:45:19.600
not just like hooking up with randos is

0:45:17.930,0:45:22.300
that really what happened it was like

0:45:19.600,0:45:28.430
figuring out what I like to do and maybe

0:45:22.300,0:45:32.240
where I wanted you know and then Matt

0:45:28.430,0:45:35.330
and I gotta sit up there because I went

0:45:32.240,0:45:36.890
on I think one day and we came back and

0:45:35.330,0:45:39.440
it was me and three of my girlfriends

0:45:36.890,0:45:43.750
and all their boyfriends came to meet us

0:45:39.440,0:45:43.750

0:47:06.480,0:47:15.140
because but it's like it's making like

0:47:09.510,0:47:18.780
the text answer I often will go too late

0:47:15.140,0:47:24.420
let's say that this wedding that is

0:47:18.780,0:47:31.290

0:47:24.420,0:47:33.480
the nominees and she just so cute even

0:47:31.290,0:47:38.070
need to have a girlfriend she was like

0:47:33.480,0:47:41.880
trying to introduce me and I was

0:47:38.070,0:47:45.780
interested and I had almost had this

0:47:41.880,0:47:47.430
idea that she might be like hey why

0:47:45.780,0:47:53.510
don't you have a girlfriend

0:47:47.430,0:47:58.320
and you know but I I think it's because

0:47:53.510,0:48:00.810
I think I'm not heartbreaker I know that

0:47:58.320,0:48:03.450
sounds silly but no I don't know it

0:48:00.810,0:48:06.690
sounds fucking silly really like it

0:48:03.450,0:48:11.670
always happens it always fucking happy

0:48:06.690,0:48:15.000
what's it I just like I I lose interest

0:48:11.670,0:48:18.660
in then I and then I spray cup with

0:48:15.000,0:48:20.609
people and it always is painful to do

0:48:18.660,0:48:25.310
that and it fucking sucks and I know

0:48:20.609,0:48:32.250
it's like wait so what I need to say is

0:48:25.310,0:48:41.010
I don't I don't like I can't wait to

0:48:32.250,0:48:42.599
like meet something that I'm just and I

0:48:41.010,0:48:47.540
got something I think they're both shit

0:48:42.599,0:48:50.030
Elsa like that was something I really

0:48:47.540,0:48:54.530
should have continued those things

0:48:50.030,0:48:55.700
they should giving you I don't know I

0:48:54.530,0:48:58.490
just should have broken up with you

0:48:55.700,0:49:01.300
sometimes I think I think I should put

0:48:58.490,0:49:03.920
more work into their relationship and

0:49:01.300,0:49:06.220
because what we had was pretty unique

0:49:03.920,0:49:09.440
and pretty solid and a lot of fun and

0:49:06.220,0:49:10.880
the fights that we had become the

0:49:09.440,0:49:16.610
understanding that we had with each

0:49:10.880,0:49:21.130
other was solid I mean you know the

0:49:16.610,0:49:21.130
goals we set for each other like the

0:49:22.030,0:49:28.820
like all back Spencer's who we would

0:49:26.660,0:49:32.330
needed to start family together house

0:49:28.820,0:49:34.810
that was very like there's a lot of

0:49:32.330,0:49:34.810
potential there

0:49:35.050,0:49:54.860
and they just I just hated picking up

0:49:43.970,0:49:58.190
his stuff in your apartment I hated I

0:49:54.860,0:50:01.400
hated white coming through all the stuff

0:49:58.190,0:50:04.070
that we had created with each other like

0:50:01.400,0:50:07.640
the paintings and stuff like that and I

0:50:04.070,0:50:09.590
just I had it was like it was like

0:50:07.640,0:50:12.880
ripping out my heart and I was like

0:50:09.590,0:50:12.880
taking out your paintings

0:50:14.670,0:50:22.500
I do that I do that again

0:50:17.940,0:50:38.070
and so it's like before things get too

0:50:22.500,0:50:42.230
serious I usually I think like and it's

0:50:38.070,0:50:53.640
like oh it's done but it's always me

0:50:42.230,0:50:54.900
it just has been so there's name to have

0:50:53.640,0:50:57.330
you start thinking about these other

0:50:54.900,0:50:59.370
relationships that were like important

0:50:57.330,0:51:02.600
relationships I mean like you can look

0:50:59.370,0:51:02.600
at three-month locks at home

0:51:41.430,0:51:44.760
when you

0:51:51.160,0:52:00.490
would you ever want would you ever think

0:51:55.730,0:52:00.490
about getting back together that's like

0:52:14.050,0:52:19.260
that's a good question Ashley

0:52:21.270,0:52:23.270
Oh

0:52:29.130,0:52:31.190
I

0:52:46.610,0:52:53.960
this is a stumped question yeah

0:52:50.720,0:53:00.960
everybody say yes or no it's like I

0:52:53.960,0:53:03.690
don't want to say like I I could see us

0:53:00.960,0:53:04.950
going on a date together really I mean

0:53:03.690,0:53:22.290
it wouldn't have to be like kissing in

0:53:04.950,0:53:26.340
the smoochy but like like maybe because

0:53:22.290,0:53:28.440
we have changed a lot but so I don't

0:53:26.340,0:53:34.280
even know if you'd be extremely

0:53:28.440,0:53:36.690
compatible I know I changed so much

0:53:34.280,0:53:39.240
people are asking always why to consider

0:53:36.690,0:53:41.730
our relationship now I think first that

0:53:39.240,0:53:45.390
lost my head is hanging on the art bar

0:53:41.730,0:53:46.890
and like making fun of other couples I

0:53:45.390,0:53:52.590
really just don't like you're telling my

0:53:46.890,0:53:56.370
sister okay which was one of the best

0:53:52.590,0:54:06.840
feelings in a way we don't really go see

0:53:56.370,0:54:09.930
at the same time you know I don't really

0:54:06.840,0:54:16.530
think that that question said it was a

0:54:09.930,0:54:20.870
fun question I can ask you whatever but

0:54:16.530,0:54:20.870
what did you ask the last time which was

0:54:30.309,0:54:42.969
I mean around here a moment I know I'm

0:54:35.529,0:54:49.329
another question or I like what would

0:54:42.969,0:54:52.839
you say - but I think it would be so

0:54:49.329,0:54:57.459
strange I think it would be so hard to

0:54:52.839,0:55:02.529
like I mean maybe it'd be fun but like

0:54:57.459,0:55:08.799
it would be I just think getting back in

0:55:02.529,0:55:13.749
the sack together would be awful yeah

0:55:08.799,0:55:16.209
because this point in time we've had so

0:55:13.749,0:55:19.630
many different like partners and things

0:55:16.209,0:55:26.739
that we would have to talk about ok yes

0:55:19.630,0:55:33.900
Anna and yeah so that's usually where I

0:55:26.739,0:55:33.900
stop that's I think as far as I go
