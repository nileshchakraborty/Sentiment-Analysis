1
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:43,750
when you think about the first time we

2
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:47,950
met what do you remember you know I

3
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:50,290
don't think about that time which

4
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:54,370
obviously wasn't the first time that we

5
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:56,290
met but I think about being at Briggs

6
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:00,210
apartment

7
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:08,259
and you were on the phone with Laura

8
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:10,810
waking up to you uh-huh you know yeah I

9
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:13,810
don't know it was my first like I'm not

10
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:24,160
like bummin might do it I want to get

11
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:27,450
kissing you know at times I do know is

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,450
the answer yeah

13
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,340
what do you cherish about our time

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,340
together as a couple

15
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:09,869
see I for those who are just joining the

16
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,720
kind of traditions that you might have

17
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:18,540
to do together those are those things

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,550
that you know I miss and I think about

19
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,390
when I think about like what's a it's a

20
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:30,120
good relationship these special things

21
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:34,940
that you develop along the years can

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,940
really just it becomes a language

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:03:19,670
yeah these are some nice what's your

24
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,670
fondest memory from our time together

25
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm gonna cry

26
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:42,250
there was a night when I was in the

27
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,250
apartment with Rebecca and was done

28
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:53,610
we were in kind of a rough patch but you

29
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:58,020
came over and slow dance with me and my

30
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:06,780
feet and do you remember this at all and

31
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:09,540
we listened to Lake guy that was a

32
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,810
marshes do you know we're talking about

33
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,810

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,530
[Music]

35
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:27,780
yes and you helped me he danced with me

36
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:30,200
and we stood for a long time and it was

37
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,200
a tough time

38
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:51,330
what moment or we the closest say New

39
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:56,490
York yeah I just thought about kind of

40
00:04:51,330 --> 00:05:00,479
what my fondest memory was and I loved

41
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,210
doing Valentine's Day with you yeah

42
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,279
and then you know following that I loved

43
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,419
like the way we did birthdays together

44
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:19,039
it loves the way we did things together

45
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:26,460
I remember that night in Woodside and

46
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:27,689
the word damn I was doing something I

47
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,409
think I was just going to work like

48
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:34,710
catering and a weird hiding such a great

49
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:40,169
night together and so you walked meeting

50
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,390
to the subway and remember like right at

51
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,519
that moment

52
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,519
[Music]

53
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:53,120
I some concept some things to be

54
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:59,450
effective I could marry you right now

55
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,400
and you said well to propose I'd say yes

56
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,410
thank you

57
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,970
and I'm just that it's kind of nice that

58
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:52,250
I had to walk away

59
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:52,250
think about that change

60
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:34,210
I'm glad that happened the way it

61
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:37,909
happened now you know back then I I

62
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,310
think there were trust issues I know

63
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:42,110
there were a little just issues and I

64
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:49,849
blame you for a lot of things but I

65
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:52,280
wasn't perfect and we were young and so

66
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:56,270
most of me wants to say just fidelity

67
00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:01,340
even though we didn't I don't know

68
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:05,199
exactly what you did I felt like I want

69
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:08,360
to say that I would change that but oh

70
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,830
my god brought together you know I guess

71
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,419
I wouldn't be the person I am today and

72
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:19,699
you wouldn't have the relationship that

73
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:22,699
we do now if it were any different do

74
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:30,110
you know so yeah I want to say our

75
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:31,880
faithfulness and I want to say because

76
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,479
they loved each other we were so in love

77
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,479
with each other

78
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:49,320
but people make mistakes and so I can't

79
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:53,970
really pinpoint exactly how to say that

80
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,380
but I wish it well I think we were

81
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,010
committed I don't think that we were

82
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,080
faithful really think that I put a lot

83
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,120
of pain in between us

84
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,950
stuff that I couldn't get over stuff

85
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,120
that took me years the over even after

86
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:17,960
we stop doing stuff that still hurts

87
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:22,500
mm-hmm yeah it's just like transitions

88
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:28,370
that we do to change the limits for why

89
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:36,210
I wonder what you're saying is uh I

90
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:38,370
don't know why it's still I mean I'm

91
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:44,540
like like continually like David just

92
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:46,410
continually know things it and like

93
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,270
relationships I've had sensitive people

94
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:53,790
just like trusted she is about mm-hmm

95
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,350
you know I wanted to marry you and like

96
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,810
I don't think after I wouldn't do that

97
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,680
again

98
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:05,540
this is real heavy shit but it's a

99
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,540
really scary place to be in

100
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,280
yes

101
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,280
no I'll an experience

102
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,629
[Music]

103
00:10:31,380 --> 00:11:30,550
I would have to okay what was the first

104
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,940
moment you realized our relationship

105
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,940
would end

106
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,340
when we first started dating you know I

107
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,650
was still getting never watch and I

108
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,840
never really allowed myself to I didn't

109
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:12,200
know how to oh that would be something

110
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:13,850
how much is that what just I think it

111
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,760
sucked that you make that conversation

112
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,170
about sleeping next and then that's a

113
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:26,510
morning that sucks

114
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:29,360
yes what I didn't know how to do was

115
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:33,410
start liking somebody at that point I'd

116
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,680
like to yeah but I'm still what I

117
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:45,260
thought in love with something like that

118
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:47,330
I kind of necessarily even and and kind

119
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:52,550
of it just has so fucking long for me to

120
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:56,860
realize that what we had been creating

121
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,860
was something more stronger

122
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:12,870
but but I remember in like as they were

123
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,840
starting to date that it wasn't a

124
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:22,020
relationship that would necessarily last

125
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:24,470
because I hadn't I wasn't you know I see

126
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,470
were so

127
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:43,560
I was I just mind to like you went

128
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:54,870
through me too and so I was here ready

129
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:58,790
to tackle the issue I'm sorry was there

130
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,790
a specific point

131
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:13,680
yeah

132
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:17,550
I remember when my dad came inside knows

133
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,629
it was Carolina and we don't be like

134
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:25,319
this speaking over the phone and it was

135
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:28,709
great and I remember when I finally open

136
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:30,540
up the computer like you to get bras to

137
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:34,100
do so they sent to the person much like

138
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:44,759
the spherical mounts and I remember

139
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:47,569
looking at the view it just it seemed

140
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:53,930
there's just a huge distance between

141
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:53,930
what was so mean

142
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:03,990
I don't know how our name is Spencer

143
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,990
thinks even though that your nearest

144
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,800
you're great Zoomers

145
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:42,860
who decided that relationship would end

146
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:45,970
how do you feel about it now even and I

147
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,970
[Music]

148
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,390
was depressed free even through my

149
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,470
religion to the Tyler just like I'm

150
00:15:52,390 --> 00:16:00,150
trying to make latch onto something that

151
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:04,560
felt anywhere near what we had you know

152
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:09,720
that wasn't how I feel about it in helm

153
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm really glad that it about it because

154
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,460
I love you you want to make favorite

155
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,680
people I'm like yeah again it took us in

156
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:24,540
a couple of years to get back on track

157
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:27,810
but you're my best friends five years a

158
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,580
long time in us yeah and I think that if

159
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,450
I can I thought about it a couple times

160
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:40,110
since we broke up but I think if we

161
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:47,730
would have held on it was just nonsense

162
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:49,290
you know how long but it just you don't

163
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,330
have the courage to do it even though I

164
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,330
was extremely heartbroken but

165
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,589
[Applause]

166
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,720
hi oh we wanted to tell this question

167
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:31,930
what would you warn my next boyfriend

168
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:38,860
about me yeah yeah I think that yeah at

169
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:50,020
that point you just started yelling at

170
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:57,220
me and there was no reason for it that's

171
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:58,960
like not really a big thing I mean a lot

172
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,510
of things I think the relationship kind

173
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,810
of wanted to hear what people might

174
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,460
dislike it's crazy I mean I don't think

175
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:21,270
that you were all that raising something

176
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:21,270

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,350
employer or like so you know like it's

188
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,350
interesting

189
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:27,620
but we were bolstering like so I think

190
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:29,480
that really like you you need a

191
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:36,820
girlfriend that's gonna laugh at every

192
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:36,820
joke they make which is not a bad thing

193
00:20:42,220 --> 00:21:12,710
I still think something back in no cuz

194
00:20:47,180 --> 00:21:31,480
I'm like does that sound bitchy no I

195
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:31,480
think okay like we're not anymore

196
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:43,730
you're totally still little or for two

197
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:49,160
years I'm busy and yeah that's in this

198
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:51,980
room with me I only say that no Zach

199
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,340
said that I will kiss it in person did

200
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,340
say that

201
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:57,109
yeah who is at fault for the

202
00:22:53,869 --> 00:23:03,009
relationship ending I think me

203
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:07,309
really definitely absolutely 100%

204
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:12,769
because I think I was the one I remain

205
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:16,700
the most mistakes and and you always

206
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:19,489
gave me another chance and so sometimes

207
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,499
i battle between whether or not that was

208
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:26,690
the right decision for me or if that was

209
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:28,849
a weak decision for anything and if

210
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,639
there was a weak decision then I think

211
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:34,309
that it's still me because I was you

212
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:37,309
know I'm okay well you shouldn't but I

213
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:43,460
think it was I think I was all my fault

214
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:48,920
I think that I probably you definitely

215
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:54,210
definitely deserved

216
00:23:48,920 --> 00:24:01,130
like a you know like a second chance

217
00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:01,130
after whatever that guy's name was

218
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:08,409
because you'd given me something so I

219
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:17,429
just felt like I really wasn't there I

220
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:17,429
don't feel like I was there you know

221
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:54,020
surprising right

222
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,020
however that was the last thing that

223
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:03,240
that's saying I feel terrible for if you

224
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,010
just now went through the last two years

225
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:11,190
thinking that you're the one that's at

226
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:27,600
fall that's fucking stupid because

227
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:33,300
that's that's oh you thought because I

228
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:37,190
was still living in green housing and

229
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:40,590
such I wrote this whole letter to you

230
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,970
this huge letter is saying like I love

231
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,460
my job

232
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:46,230
huzi better I like it better whatever

233
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,040
you need to make this work I'll do it

234
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:53,160
and John came home and I read it John

235
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,540
and he was like you're fucking insane it

236
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,150
was like you said it you really think

237
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,130
like like and you're just need to get

238
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,630
over it and like you guys are fine it's

239
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,670
not a big Jimmy who's been in there for

240
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:07,280
five fucking years like something's

241
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:07,280
bound to happen but and I was

242
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:52,159
and their relationship that I mean yeah

243
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:57,429
yeah I thought sexy anything like what

244
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,429
we were good we were good you know

245
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:12,350
that's true that's really good yes

246
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:15,620
trying to think with all that entails

247
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,549
we had a great sex life even when we

248
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:26,500
were mad at each other

249
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:29,690
oh yeah yeah yeah you make me feel good

250
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,929
here yeah this is good you were you're a

251
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,929
great

252
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:43,289
did you give me like a questionnaire

253
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,820
did you like breakdown things about our

254
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:47,820
relations I did I filled out the

255
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,850
question if they use this oh I didn't do

256
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,850
that

257
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,419
why did you cheat on you so many times

258
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:20,039
or why so many times I didn't cheat on

259
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:34,220
you so many times I did not like do the

260
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:34,220
act of cheating oh yes

261
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,230
that sucks

262
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:43,909
see I'm still upset about it I know but

263
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,909
hey I never slept with anybody else

264
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,610
that's fucking gross man

265
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:55,580
that's cheating

266
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,730
I never said it wasn't I just said that

267
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,760
you know I feel like the question

268
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:07,110
implies that I did so many things so

269
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,730
many times and I didn't I did like I

270
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,230
would say a few - when you sit when

271
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:15,809
something says so many times that

272
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:18,120
implies like sex well I was the only

273
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:23,850
give you a clear understanding maybe of

274
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:32,059
what you don't know the question is why

275
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:35,059
did I and I think it's because I was

276
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:35,059
interested

277
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,590
and our Russians

278
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,730
ah

279
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,590
why didn't you under with me

280
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:04,560
that's right after I look that that

281
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:09,810
night that it all kind of first started

282
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:12,370
we didn't do anything we talked and then

283
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,470
about two weeks later I broke up with

284
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:20,770
you because I felt like I had been

285
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:23,980
dishonest and then that's when something

286
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:28,960
happened and then you and I talked about

287
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:43,540
it a month later and then we got back

288
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:46,450
together I started nearly I feel like

289
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,040
sometimes I feel like I try to do it the

290
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:56,110
best way and sometimes I feel like it

291
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:58,680
just a nice no take the salt for at all

292
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,680
like

293
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,230
and I think it's kind of weird not weird

294
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,460
it's it's you know when you ask when you

295
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:19,200
say like every time we're in college you

296
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:25,170
know you have one way of kind of talking

297
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:27,920
about it as you know as we're really

298
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,920
talking about

299
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,420
why did I give so much sense

300
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,289
[Music]

301
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,960
yeah I don't have dancers

302
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:57,530
it looks the one thing I should have

303
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:59,580
time to save the relationship one thing

304
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:02,390
you could have done in the things

305
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,390
relationship

306
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:21,270
get your dick in your pants

307
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,809
I don't know I don't think that was the

308
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:30,360
problem

309
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:36,240
my dick was like everywhere Christ

310
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:38,760
what's I don't know I don't know I don't

311
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:48,740
think they're this is my question

312
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:55,290
okay I don't think there's anything I

313
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:58,200
honestly like we talked about sticks

314
00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:00,860
with me and there's a doozy so there's a

315
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,860
list and

316
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,250
all right wait because I don't know I

317
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,929
don't think I could save it I don't

318
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:19,409
think that's the rule that I was playing

319
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:23,580
I don't think that I don't think the

320
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:41,720
other thing like bill I got I don't

321
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:41,720
think that was the case I mean I agree

322
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:52,649
more with them why do you want to still

323
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:55,399
be friends those break up because I

324
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,399
really miss you

325
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,240
it's like you know and that's also just

326
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:17,150
who I am

327
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:21,869
right I really just

328
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:25,680
I'm sure there's like deep psychological

329
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:31,320
issues with me where I don't want to

330
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:36,150
feel like maybe like not like there's

331
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:42,050
something which is why which is why I

332
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:42,050
wanted to continue friendships with exes

333
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:49,680
but I'm all I mean forever for the most

334
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:54,990
part the people that you know were maybe

335
00:35:49,680 --> 00:36:01,700
people that were not very ugly so you

336
00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:01,700
know water like I don't talk to them and

337
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:15,619
but I still talk to you you're wonderful

338
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:25,700
just pure joy you know you said to me

339
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:34,920
has fuckin haunts me you said to me that

340
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:38,910
I will never find somebody that loves

341
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:42,869
you the way that you love me but you

342
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,880
love me the most and you said that

343
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,869
tonight

344
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:55,960
several times

345
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:57,940
and it's like every year so - so far

346
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,240
that's gone by it like I said only

347
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:05,980
continue yeah anything else - but I

348
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:09,250
think - yeah maybe we're coming up on

349
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,260
three but each one that goes by I start

350
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:19,390
thinking you might be right

351
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:21,609
you might be right fucking alone I think

352
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:26,140
it's there I mean I like it

353
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:35,049
like I'm not complaining I just better

354
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:46,329
this year and so that's why I want you

355
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:50,099
so many friends how can you look me in

356
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,099
the eyes after I broke your trust

357
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:13,880
do they love you it's like it's really

358
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:17,300
simple I know that and I still love them

359
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:21,710
I don't know we hit somewhere along the

360
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:29,420
road we hit something right I always

361
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:31,220
want you to be in my life and how can

362
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,290
you look me in the eyes I started to do

363
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,290
shots yeah

364
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:42,820
you know even though a lot of what

365
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,820
happened it's really shitty

366
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:57,380
yeah there was a question but that

367
00:38:51,740 --> 00:39:04,619
horrible wretched human being of a girl

368
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:05,970
asked me which was why why can't why you

369
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:15,950
want to be friends with me even though

370
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:15,950
it was he you know did it to that girl

371
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,720
anyway see even though it seems like

372
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:24,750
there's still like deep deep down you're

373
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,910
still anger there anyway but it was easy

374
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:31,589
for me because you don't need me think

375
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:39,779
to me that you do you know like you're

376
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:43,380
this NAT but we venture shit and you

377
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:48,410
know me and I know you I know really who

378
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,410
you are and that's more important

379
00:39:50,090 --> 00:40:01,520
do you think that this friendship will

380
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:06,130
continue I mean seems like your new

381
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:14,650
boyfriend is a little bit possessive or

382
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:17,500
insecure and I was really excited to

383
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,780
hang out at you like six months ago

384
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:25,040
like rediscover a friendship since then

385
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:31,210
I don't feel like you've always been

386
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:37,670
able to and feel like do you think that

387
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:41,500
this experience that we went through is

388
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,500
it do you think in any way that kind of

389
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:48,350
informs you now how to like really tears

390
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:51,530
Jessie but all you know all the student

391
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:54,200
that we went through all this shit that

392
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,150
we went through being in a relationship

393
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,040
maybe talking to Exodus you know that

394
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,200
always being kind uncomfortable and now

395
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,670
you and I are exes but we're developing

396
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,400
a friendship and you're in a

397
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:14,780
relationship and sometimes it seems like

398
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:16,780
he's not comfortable talking to me but

399
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:28,820
we work together for a really long time

400
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:30,320
and I don't know I agree with you but

401
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,570
there's always gonna be something

402
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,970
between us excellent not more than the

403
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,640
friends but it's gonna be more than

404
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:42,040
friends

405
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,040
just some guy I dated for six months

406
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:48,340
passed and he knows that and so I think

407
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:57,310
yeah he is he's kind of possessive and

408
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,310
he's kind of insecure but I think he's

409
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:04,040
doing okay dude but I mean like even I

410
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:08,780
mean he's not gonna stop you from coming

411
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:11,300

412
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:15,130

anything you know I feel about the

431
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,170
decisions that they made but I wouldn't

432
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:19,170
call it was done right

433
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:30,990
cuz again I'm glad it all happened I

434
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:30,990
learned a lot a lot even

435
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:46,370
learned a lot I was seriously depressed

436
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:48,110
yeah for a long time but that person on

437
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,960
my home which was something I've never

438
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:55,880
had to deal with and realizing like a

439
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:57,980
serial monogamist in this crazy his

440
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,390
sirens yeah because that your Titan I

441
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,120
broke up and before Matt and I got

442
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,700
together I finally had a couple months

443
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:09,320
only to like be alone that used to scare

444
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:13,460
me but like I solidly loved it

445
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:15,170
so the point wondering like I'm 26

446
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,930
living in New York City it was fun and

447
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,600
not just like hooking up with randos is

448
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,300
that really what happened it was like

449
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:28,430
figuring out what I like to do and maybe

450
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:32,240
where I wanted you know and then Matt

451
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:35,330
and I gotta sit up there because I went

452
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,890
on I think one day and we came back and

453
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:39,440
it was me and three of my girlfriends

454
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:43,750
and all their boyfriends came to meet us

455
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,750
at work and he came

456
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,900

469
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,420
been in a relationship since we broke up

470
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:09,510
I actually have an incident of this yeah

471
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:15,140
because but it's like it's making like

472
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:18,780
the text answer I often will go too late

473
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:24,420
let's say that this wedding that is

474
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:31,290
going to for my belly this woman one of

475
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:33,480
the nominees and she just so cute even

476
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:38,070
need to have a girlfriend she was like

477
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:41,880
trying to introduce me and I was

478
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:45,780
interested and I had almost had this

479
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,430
idea that she might be like hey why

480
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:53,510
don't you have a girlfriend

481
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:58,320
and you know but I I think it's because

482
00:47:53,510 --> 00:48:00,810
I think I'm not heartbreaker I know that

483
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,450
sounds silly but no I don't know it

484
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:06,690
sounds fucking silly really like it

485
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:11,670
always happens it always fucking happy

486
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:15,000
what's it I just like I I lose interest

487
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:18,660
in then I and then I spray cup with

488
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,609
people and it always is painful to do

489
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:25,310
that and it fucking sucks and I know

490
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:32,250
it's like wait so what I need to say is

491
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:41,010
I don't I don't like I can't wait to

492
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:42,599
like meet something that I'm just and I

493
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:47,540
got something I think they're both shit

494
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:50,030
Elsa like that was something I really

495
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:54,530
should have continued those things

496
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:55,700
they should giving you I don't know I

497
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:58,490
just should have broken up with you

498
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:01,300
sometimes I think I think I should put

499
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:03,920
more work into their relationship and

500
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:06,220
because what we had was pretty unique

501
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,440
and pretty solid and a lot of fun and

502
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,880
the fights that we had become the

503
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,610
understanding that we had with each

504
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:21,130
other was solid I mean you know the

505
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,130
goals we set for each other like the

506
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:28,820
like all back Spencer's who we would

507
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:32,330
needed to start family together house

508
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:34,810
that was very like there's a lot of

509
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,810
potential there

510
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:54,860
and they just I just hated picking up

511
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:58,190
his stuff in your apartment I hated I

512
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:01,400
hated white coming through all the stuff

513
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:04,070
that we had created with each other like

514
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,640
the paintings and stuff like that and I

515
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:09,590
just I had it was like it was like

516
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,880
ripping out my heart and I was like

517
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,880
taking out your paintings

518
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:22,500
I do that I do that again

519
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:38,070
and so it's like before things get too

520
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:42,230
serious I usually I think like and it's

521
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:53,640
like oh it's done but it's always me

522
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:54,900
it just has been so there's name to have

523
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,330
you start thinking about these other

524
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,370
relationships that were like important

525
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:02,600
relationships I mean like you can look

526
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,600
at three-month locks at home

527
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:44,760
when you

528
00:51:51,160 --> 00:52:00,490
would you ever want would you ever think

529
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:00,490
about getting back together that's like

530
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:19,260
that's a good question Ashley

531
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,270
Oh

532
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,190
I

533
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:53,960
this is a stumped question yeah

534
00:52:50,720 --> 00:53:00,960
everybody say yes or no it's like I

535
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:03,690
don't want to say like I I could see us

536
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,950
going on a date together really I mean

537
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:22,290
it wouldn't have to be like kissing in

538
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:26,340
the smoochy but like like maybe because

539
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:28,440
we have changed a lot but so I don't

540
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:34,280
even know if you'd be extremely

541
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:36,690
compatible I know I changed so much

542
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,240
people are asking always why to consider

543
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:41,730
our relationship now I think first that

544
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:45,390
lost my head is hanging on the art bar

545
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,890
and like making fun of other couples I

546
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:52,590
really just don't like you're telling my

547
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:56,370
sister okay which was one of the best

548
00:53:52,590 --> 00:54:06,840
feelings in a way we don't really go see

549
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:09,930
at the same time you know I don't really

550
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:16,530
think that that question said it was a

551
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:20,870
fun question I can ask you whatever but

552
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:20,870
what did you ask the last time which was

553
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:42,969
I mean around here a moment I know I'm

554
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:49,329
another question or I like what would

555
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:52,839
you say - but I think it would be so

556
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:57,459
strange I think it would be so hard to

557
00:54:52,839 --> 00:55:02,529
like I mean maybe it'd be fun but like

558
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:08,799
it would be I just think getting back in

559
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:13,749
the sack together would be awful yeah

560
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:16,209
because this point in time we've had so

561
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:19,630
many different like partners and things

562
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:26,739
that we would have to talk about ok yes

563
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:33,900
Anna and yeah so that's usually where I

564
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:33,900
stop that's I think as far as I go
