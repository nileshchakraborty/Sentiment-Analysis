Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0048,catering and a weird hiding such a great
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0049,night together and so you walked meeting

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0058,I had to walk away

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0060,I'm glad that happened the way it
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0061,happened now you know back then I I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0062,think there were trust issues I know
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0063,there were a little just issues and I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0064,blame you for a lot of things but I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0065,wasn't perfect and we were young and so
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0066,most of me wants to say just fidelity
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0067,even though we didn't I don't know
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0068,exactly what you did I felt like I want
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0069,to say that I would change that but oh
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0070,my god brought together you know I guess
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0071,I wouldn't be the person I am today and
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0072,you wouldn't have the relationship that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0073,we do now if it were any different do
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0074,you know so yeah I want to say our
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0075,faithfulness and I want to say because
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0076,they loved each other we were so in love
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0077,with each other
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0078,but people make mistakes and so I can't
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0079,really pinpoint exactly how to say that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0080,but I wish it well I think we were
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0081,committed I don't think that we were
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0082,faithful really think that I put a lot
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0083,of pain in between us
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0084,stuff that I couldn't get over stuff
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0085,that took me years the over even after
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0086,we stop doing stuff that still hurts
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0087,mm-hmm yeah it's just like transitions
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0088,that we do to change the limits for why
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0089,I wonder what you're saying is uh I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0090,don't know why it's still I mean I'm
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0091,like like continually like David just
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0092,continually know things it and like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0093,relationships I've had sensitive people

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0095,you know I wanted to marry you and like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0096,I don't think after I wouldn't do that

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0098,this is real heavy shit but it's a
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0099,really scary place to be in

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0106,when we first started dating you know I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0107,was still getting never watch and I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0108,never really allowed myself to I didn't
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0109,know how to oh that would be something
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0110,how much is that what just I think it
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0111,sucked that you make that conversation
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0112,about sleeping next and then that's a
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0113,morning that sucks
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0114,yes what I didn't know how to do was
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0115,start liking somebody at that point I'd
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0116,like to yeah but I'm still what I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0117,thought in love with something like that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0118,I kind of necessarily even and and kind
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0119,of it just has so fucking long for me to
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0120,realize that what we had been creating
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0121,was something more stronger
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0122,but but I remember in like as they were
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0123,starting to date that it wasn't a
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0124,relationship that would necessarily last
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0125,because I hadn't I wasn't you know I see
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0126,were so
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0127,I was I just mind to like you went
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0128,through me too and so I was here ready
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0129,to tackle the issue I'm sorry was there
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0130,a specific point
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0131,yeah

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0137,do so they sent to the person much like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0138,the spherical mounts and I remember
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0139,looking at the view it just it seemed
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0140,there's just a huge distance between
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0141,what was so mean
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0142,I don't know how our name is Spencer
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0143,thinks even though that your nearest

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0157,but you're my best friends five years a
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0158,long time in us yeah and I think that if
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0159,I can I thought about it a couple times
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0160,since we broke up but I think if we
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0161,would have held on it was just nonsense
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0162,you know how long but it just you don't
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0163,have the courage to do it even though I

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0171,like not really a big thing I mean a lot
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0172,of things I think the relationship kind
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0173,of wanted to hear what people might
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0174,dislike it's crazy I mean I don't think
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0175,that you were all that raising something
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0176,to give it a little like that sometimes
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0177,[Music]

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0188,interesting

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0201,yeah who is at fault for the
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0202,relationship ending I think me
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0203,really definitely absolutely 100%
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0204,because I think I was the one I remain
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0205,the most mistakes and and you always
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0206,gave me another chance and so sometimes
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0207,i battle between whether or not that was
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0208,the right decision for me or if that was
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0209,a weak decision for anything and if
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0210,there was a weak decision then I think
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0211,that it's still me because I was you
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0212,know I'm okay well you shouldn't but I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0213,think it was I think I was all my fault
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0214,I think that I probably you definitely
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0215,definitely deserved
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0216,like a you know like a second chance
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0217,after whatever that guy's name was
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0218,because you'd given me something so I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0219,just felt like I really wasn't there I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0220,don't feel like I was there you know
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0221,surprising right
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0222,however that was the last thing that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0223,that's saying I feel terrible for if you
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0224,just now went through the last two years
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0225,thinking that you're the one that's at
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0226,fall that's fucking stupid because

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0254,relations I did I filled out the
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0255,question if they use this oh I didn't do
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0256,that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0257,why did you cheat on you so many times
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0258,or why so many times I didn't cheat on
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0259,you so many times I did not like do the
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0260,act of cheating oh yes
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0261,that sucks

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0266,I never said it wasn't I just said that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0267,you know I feel like the question
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0268,implies that I did so many things so
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0269,many times and I didn't I did like I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0270,would say a few - when you sit when
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0271,something says so many times that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0272,implies like sex well I was the only
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0273,give you a clear understanding maybe of
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0274,what you don't know the question is why
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0275,did I and I think it's because I was
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0276,interested
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0277,and our Russians
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0278,ah
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0279,why didn't you under with me
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0280,that's right after I look that that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0281,night that it all kind of first started
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0282,we didn't do anything we talked and then
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0283,about two weeks later I broke up with
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0284,you because I felt like I had been
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0285,dishonest and then that's when something
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0286,happened and then you and I talked about
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0287,it a month later and then we got back
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0288,together I started nearly I feel like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0289,sometimes I feel like I try to do it the
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0290,best way and sometimes I feel like it
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0291,just a nice no take the salt for at all
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0292,like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0293,and I think it's kind of weird not weird
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0294,it's it's you know when you ask when you
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0295,say like every time we're in college you
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0296,know you have one way of kind of talking
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0297,about it as you know as we're really
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0298,talking about
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0299,why did I give so much sense

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0301,yeah I don't have dancers
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0302,it looks the one thing I should have
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0303,time to save the relationship one thing
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0304,you could have done in the things
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0305,relationship

Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0497,just should have broken up with you
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0498,sometimes I think I think I should put
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0499,more work into their relationship and
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0500,because what we had was pretty unique
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0501,and pretty solid and a lot of fun and
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0502,the fights that we had become the
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0503,understanding that we had with each
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0504,other was solid I mean you know the
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0505,goals we set for each other like the
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0506,like all back Spencer's who we would
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0507,needed to start family together house
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0508,that was very like there's a lot of
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0509,potential there
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0510,and they just I just hated picking up
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0511,his stuff in your apartment I hated I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0512,hated white coming through all the stuff
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0513,that we had created with each other like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0514,the paintings and stuff like that and I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0515,just I had it was like it was like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0516,ripping out my heart and I was like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0517,taking out your paintings
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0518,I do that I do that again
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0519,and so it's like before things get too
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0520,serious I usually I think like and it's
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0521,like oh it's done but it's always me
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0522,it just has been so there's name to have
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0523,you start thinking about these other
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0524,relationships that were like important
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0525,relationships I mean like you can look
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0526,at three-month locks at home
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0527,when you
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0528,would you ever want would you ever think
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0529,about getting back together that's like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0530,that's a good question Ashley
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0531,Oh
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0532,I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0533,this is a stumped question yeah
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0534,everybody say yes or no it's like I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0535,don't want to say like I I could see us
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0536,going on a date together really I mean
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0537,it wouldn't have to be like kissing in
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0538,the smoochy but like like maybe because
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0539,we have changed a lot but so I don't
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0540,even know if you'd be extremely
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0541,compatible I know I changed so much
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0542,people are asking always why to consider
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0543,our relationship now I think first that
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0544,lost my head is hanging on the art bar
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0545,and like making fun of other couples I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0546,really just don't like you're telling my
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0547,sister okay which was one of the best
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0548,feelings in a way we don't really go see
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0549,at the same time you know I don't really
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0550,think that that question said it was a
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0551,fun question I can ask you whatever but
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0552,what did you ask the last time which was
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0553,I mean around here a moment I know I'm
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0554,another question or I like what would
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0555,you say - but I think it would be so
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0556,strange I think it would be so hard to
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0557,like I mean maybe it'd be fun but like
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0558,it would be I just think getting back in
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0559,the sack together would be awful yeah
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0560,because this point in time we've had so
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0561,many different like partners and things
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0562,that we would have to talk about ok yes
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0563,Anna and yeah so that's usually where I
Man008_Woman008_Transcription_0564,stop that's I think as far as I go
