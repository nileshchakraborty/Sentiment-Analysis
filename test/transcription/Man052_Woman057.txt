Man052_Woman057_0112,stir in the bed you just drop everything
Man052_Woman057_0113,and you come in and you take the pillow
Man052_Woman057_0114,away and you replace yourself with a
Man052_Woman057_0115,pillow and then we nuzzle and I kiss
Man052_Woman057_0116,your head and you know smell the top of
Man052_Woman057_0117,your head and it's the most beautiful
Man052_Woman057_0118,yes today it's a wonderful way to say
Man052_Woman057_0119,there's nothing more important this dis
Man052_Woman057_0120,life than feeling loved and when your
Man052_Woman057_0121,partner gives you those wings and
Man052_Woman057_0122,there's little morning rituals that we
Man052_Woman057_0123,have I think yes absolutely
Man052_Woman057_0124,what are you hesitant to tell me I don't
Man052_Woman057_0125,know we tried hard that's one thing we
Man052_Woman057_0126,try hard not to do is do not know not
Man052_Woman057_0127,tell each other anything yeah I think I
Man052_Woman057_0128,think that's why our relationship is
Man052_Woman057_0129,strong is because we don't have if
Man052_Woman057_0130,something's oh I always felt like in
Man052_Woman057_0131,order to solve a problem you have to
Man052_Woman057_0132,communicate the problem because other
Man052_Woman057_0133,person you're not a mind-reader
Man052_Woman057_0134,you know you got you can't I think years
Man052_Woman057_0135,ago I was hesitant to open up and
Man052_Woman057_0136,express my love to you know because why
Man052_Woman057_0137,well because of past relationships and
Man052_Woman057_0138,yeah and the whole saying I love you
Man052_Woman057_0139,hurt to say yeah because because of the
Man052_Woman057_0140,hurt from years ago reminds me remember
Man052_Woman057_0141,you'll be hesitant to tell me you love
Man052_Woman057_0142,me or that we even have a relationship
Man052_Woman057_0143,but the first thing you bought for me
Man052_Woman057_0144,it's like oh I don't know is this a
Man052_Woman057_0145,relationship it the second time you came
Man052_Woman057_0146,over
Man052_Woman057_0147,yeah yes it was there was a freeing to
Man052_Woman057_0148,get over that yeah and thankfully you
Man052_Woman057_0149,knew it yeah but you you know just
Man052_Woman057_0150,waited for me to get over that yeah some
Man052_Woman057_0151,you know I had my own right my love I
Man052_Woman057_0152,had my own hesitations and losses right
Man052_Woman057_0153,I think it's probably why you understood
Man052_Woman057_0154,yeah but I think that communication is
Man052_Woman057_0155,the key and a lot of people I think
Man052_Woman057_0156,they're in a relationship and you know
Man052_Woman057_0157,our relationship could have been like
Man052_Woman057_0158,that is if if you don't say how you feel
Man052_Woman057_0159,how do you expect other person to
Man052_Woman057_0160,correct or to explain themselves and
Man052_Woman057_0161,sometimes that creates even more bigger
Man052_Woman057_0162,problem that actually is yeah yeah naman
Man052_Woman057_0163,said you go for that issue yeah and it
Man052_Woman057_0164,could be something easily solved by just
Man052_Woman057_0165,saying the word
Man052_Woman057_0166,okay is there is anything what at the
Man052_Woman057_0167,same question anything that you hesitant
Man052_Woman057_0168,about now that you want to share if you
Man052_Woman057_0169,could change one thing in our
Man052_Woman057_0170,relationship what would you what what
Man052_Woman057_0171,would it be and why
Man052_Woman057_0172,I don't have a lot more jobs would be
Man052_Woman057_0173,working a lot more together that's yeah
Man052_Woman057_0174,as much as we do work together I would
Man052_Woman057_0175,be I would amp that up so there's a lot
Man052_Woman057_0176,more in a lot in different parts of the
Man052_Woman057_0177,world than just traveling and working
Man052_Woman057_0178,together constantly that'd be awesome
Man052_Woman057_0179,yeah I think it'll happen yeah we're
Man052_Woman057_0180,working toward that our relationships
Man052_Woman057_0181,our relationship to us it's like I think
Man052_Woman057_0182,even the mistakes that had wouldn't
Man052_Woman057_0183,change them because that's that's what
Man052_Woman057_0184,made us who we are right
Man052_Woman057_0185,I mean what mistakes you don't really
Man052_Woman057_0186,yeah I mean they're not we had arguments
Man052_Woman057_0187,in the past but our arguments were all
Man052_Woman057_0188,based on a chess game of fighting for
Man052_Woman057_0189,your own position and the relationship
Man052_Woman057_0190,and and we respected the other person
Man052_Woman057_0191,for wanting that position as long as you
Man052_Woman057_0192,allowed me to have this position and
Man052_Woman057_0193,it's been a back-and-forth of very
Man052_Woman057_0194,mature responsible negotiations and I
Man052_Woman057_0195,think even I mean you know I always
Man052_Woman057_0196,loved that about you that ability to you
Man052_Woman057_0197,know compromise and really listen you
Man052_Woman057_0198,know lots of times in I know lots of my
Man052_Woman057_0199,friends I have partners that it's like
Man052_Woman057_0200,talking to a wall you know they just
Man052_Woman057_0201,don't understand or want to change and
Man052_Woman057_0202,then understand like if something bad
Man052_Woman057_0203,there's another person that maybe you
Man052_Woman057_0204,should change it but that is a this
Man052_Woman057_0205,amazing ability that you have is to
Man052_Woman057_0206,really listen and compromise and I think
Man052_Woman057_0207,we both well yes you do but you you
Man052_Woman057_0208,definitely you know took a lead when it
Man052_Woman057_0209,comes to that you know you picked your
Man052_Woman057_0210,battles because you know I'm a little
Man052_Woman057_0211,bit more fiery
Man052_Woman057_0212,and but you knew when to just let it
Man052_Woman057_0213,roll over and I I wouldn't change
Man052_Woman057_0214,anything not even not one single
Man052_Woman057_0215,argument because I think it led us to
Man052_Woman057_0216,where we are today
Man052_Woman057_0217,you know it's learning process it's you
Man052_Woman057_0218,know yeah we don't have this by accident
Man052_Woman057_0219,no yeah it's a lots of work this kind of
Man052_Woman057_0220,relationships you've been working 13
Man052_Woman057_0221,years yes exactly and thirteen more yeah
Man052_Woman057_0222,tell me about the time I disappointed
Man052_Woman057_0223,you and how do you feel about it now I
Man052_Woman057_0224,you know even if I perceived something
Man052_Woman057_0225,as a disappointment that I understood it
Man052_Woman057_0226,you know and I maybe was not even you
Man052_Woman057_0227,but it was the way I was viewing a
Man052_Woman057_0228,situation for know for example um things
Man052_Woman057_0229,that I've changed and you know in
Man052_Woman057_0230,discussions we've had you know how I
Man052_Woman057_0231,used to have a bit of bitterness in me
Man052_Woman057_0232,oh yeah you know the anger and
Man052_Woman057_0233,resentment towards other people you know
Man052_Woman057_0234,about you know where they were and life
Man052_Woman057_0235,compared to where I am and that's
Man052_Woman057_0236,awesome yeah but it but you see you
Man052_Woman057_0237,didn't necessarily disappoint me if
Man052_Woman057_0238,anything you made was deciding it was a
Man052_Woman057_0239,pointing because you know like you can't
Man052_Woman057_0240,and you know this you know you can't
Man052_Woman057_0241,concentrate and compare yourself to
Man052_Woman057_0242,other people because you have to be busy
Man052_Woman057_0243,building your own life and your own
Man052_Woman057_0244,success and your little place of heaven
Man052_Woman057_0245,I know something that you helped me too
Man052_Woman057_0246,yeah but but they see that's where your
Man052_Woman057_0247,that's where I'm you made me proud is
Man052_Woman057_0248,the fact that you have this ability to
Man052_Woman057_0249,change and to actually look within
Man052_Woman057_0250,yourself because a lot of people they
Man052_Woman057_0251,walk alter their life being bitter and
Man052_Woman057_0252,resent
Man052_Woman057_0253,and stuff and you know this is kind of
Man052_Woman057_0254,like to quote Dexter it's a Dark
Man052_Woman057_0255,Passenger you know when you become when
Man052_Woman057_0256,you go into those darks it's very easy
Man052_Woman057_0257,for me I was raised with the very
Man052_Woman057_0258,confident mother so she instilled the
Man052_Woman057_0259,confidence in me but with you you really
Man052_Woman057_0260,had to work at it and yes when you slip
Man052_Woman057_0261,and become bitter I am disappointed but
Man052_Woman057_0262,I'm there for you to pick you up and
Man052_Woman057_0263,kind of slap you around a little bit and
Man052_Woman057_0264,say wait now practice it's an all yeah
Man052_Woman057_0265,it's not other people it's me it's just
Man052_Woman057_0266,what see me yeah I think the lots of
Man052_Woman057_0267,artists have that I mean I I compare
Man052_Woman057_0268,myself to but it doesn't last as long or
Man052_Woman057_0269,is it deep right as it does with you but
Man052_Woman057_0270,and I think you know that's pretty much
Man052_Woman057_0271,it's gone it's been a while you know but
Man052_Woman057_0272,it it is something that I'm very proud
Man052_Woman057_0273,of and it's it's a huge achievement you
Man052_Woman057_0274,know just being having that ability to
Man052_Woman057_0275,work on yourself
Man052_Woman057_0276,is an amazing ability and that's
Man052_Woman057_0277,rewarding yes it's very morning you know
Man052_Woman057_0278,so I can I think my disappointments with
Man052_Woman057_0279,you or I'm assuming vice versa would be
Man052_Woman057_0280,very momentarily and I think we would
Man052_Woman057_0281,try to look for a solution that's part
Man052_Woman057_0282,of the base of what relationship do is
Man052_Woman057_0283,helping each other to become better at
Man052_Woman057_0284,people yeah yeah it's like building
Man052_Woman057_0285,blocks right so there's nothing
Man052_Woman057_0286,lingering around that's boiling you know
Man052_Woman057_0287,no our glass is half-full
Man052_Woman057_0288,who has more power in the relationship
Man052_Woman057_0289,you or me that goes that's a big debate
Man052_Woman057_0290,I think we share we share power yeah we
Man052_Woman057_0291,let the other person have power when
Man052_Woman057_0292,it's when we see that this is something
Man052_Woman057_0293,that person really wants you want to
Man052_Woman057_0294,have the power now you get in the power
Man052_Woman057_0295,now and vice versa you want power on
Man052_Woman057_0296,this I'll let you have power in that and
Man052_Woman057_0297,we that's the other thing that we've
Man052_Woman057_0298,part of what we've worked at allowing
Man052_Woman057_0299,each other to have to and through the
Man052_Woman057_0300,realizing that if I want if I want this
Man052_Woman057_0301,person to let me have power I need to
Man052_Woman057_0302,let them have power at times - yes
Man052_Woman057_0303,through communication and you know and
Man052_Woman057_0304,creatively through a lot of heated
Man052_Woman057_0305,alright everybody
Man052_Woman057_0306,arguments there's you know early on it
Man052_Woman057_0307,was a lot of a learning process of of
Man052_Woman057_0308,that thing when to let the other person
Man052_Woman057_0309,have control or or handle how to even
Man052_Woman057_0310,let someone else have control without
Man052_Woman057_0311,feeling that you've or that that you've
Man052_Woman057_0312,totally laid down yeah I don't have a
Man052_Woman057_0313,say you still have a say even though you
Man052_Woman057_0314,may not be the one running and running
Man052_Woman057_0315,the show you know and I'm completely
Man052_Woman057_0316,comfortable with you taking the wheel
Man052_Woman057_0317,sometimes completely you know what I
Man052_Woman057_0318,mean because I trust you and that's
Man052_Woman057_0319,something as you know I have a history
Man052_Woman057_0320,of just running away but the thing is
Man052_Woman057_0321,that you are the first person that ever
Man052_Woman057_0322,allowed me to completely let go of my
Man052_Woman057_0323,control because all my life I've been
Man052_Woman057_0324,independent and you know never depended
Man052_Woman057_0325,on anyone right and I wanted to be
Man052_Woman057_0326,independent yeah but and I am I am still
Man052_Woman057_0327,but I also feel like independent
Man052_Woman057_0328,together yeah but I feel like I can
Man052_Woman057_0329,finally let go of off of control and
Man052_Woman057_0330,know that I'm safe
Man052_Woman057_0331,that some somebody else has my face or
Man052_Woman057_0332,my heart in their hands and they mean
Man052_Woman057_0333,the best for me right first terms so for
Man052_Woman057_0334,mine or his am I the best sex you've
Man052_Woman057_0335,ever had yes absolutely
Man052_Woman057_0336,I'm not that I had a lot of it but I
Man052_Woman057_0337,definitely because to me sex and love
Man052_Woman057_0338,are the same thing I admire people who
Man052_Woman057_0339,can just have casual encounters and not
Man052_Woman057_0340,be emotionally entangled but I'm not one
Man052_Woman057_0341,of those people and I'm fine with that
Man052_Woman057_0342,and I think our sex is gentle and crazy
Man052_Woman057_0343,and adventurous when it needs to be but
Man052_Woman057_0344,also I think we never stop being
Man052_Woman057_0345,connected with each other
Man052_Woman057_0346,we're intimate 24 hours a day yeah and
Man052_Woman057_0347,and you know and it's also people think
Man052_Woman057_0348,that intimacy is only you know
Man052_Woman057_0349,intercourse or whatever but it's when
Man052_Woman057_0350,you slap me on my butt or squeeze my
Man052_Woman057_0351,boob or you kissed me when you pass by
Man052_Woman057_0352,or rub my back while I'm cooking or me
Man052_Woman057_0353,you know that's the same thing it's the
Man052_Woman057_0354,same thing I think I think we have sex
Man052_Woman057_0355,24/7 yeah when you tell me a little
Man052_Woman057_0356,dirty think in my ear while I'm you know
Man052_Woman057_0357,somewhere in public whatever and make me

Man052_Woman057_0367,friend I was visiting in Pennsylvania
Man052_Woman057_0368,and how we spend every every minute
Man052_Woman057_0369,together every waking moment if we work
Man052_Woman057_0370,together and you know and we wake up
Man052_Woman057_0371,together go to sleep together and do
Man052_Woman057_0372,this you know he's like I want to I'm

Man052_Woman057_0383,enough see you're the only person
Man052_Woman057_0384,because you know I'm a loner no matter

Man052_Woman057_0386,we're you know outside and interacting
Man052_Woman057_0387,with people and I love people but you
Man052_Woman057_0388,know that I need time to be just
Man052_Woman057_0389,completely by myself and you know pain
Man052_Woman057_0390,to not communicate with people but for
Man052_Woman057_0391,some reason even when you are you can be
Man052_Woman057_0392,with me 24/7 but I never feel crowded
Man052_Woman057_0393,you never make me feel suffocated which
Man052_Woman057_0394,is something that I had problems with
Man052_Woman057_0395,within other relationships is that I
Man052_Woman057_0396,felt like my personal freedom like I'm
Man052_Woman057_0397,totally not one of those cleaning women
Man052_Woman057_0398,you know you do not have to pay
Man052_Woman057_0399,attention to me 24/7 to actually leave
Man052_Woman057_0400,me alone and you know
Man052_Woman057_0401,sometimes you were kind of like two
Man052_Woman057_0402,chirpy and I'm like okay now walk away
Man052_Woman057_0403,just pretend I'm not here but I think
Man052_Woman057_0404,you just you just let me be and you
Man052_Woman057_0405,being next to me is it's like air it's
Man052_Woman057_0406,something that I need to just you know
Man052_Woman057_0407,smolder like you know the fire needs air
Man052_Woman057_0408,and and I'm so grateful for it
Man052_Woman057_0409,no I we can never we're just fusing
Man052_Woman057_0410,together yeah for the years it's
Man052_Woman057_0411,beautiful
Man052_Woman057_0412,we're gonna get like their three legged
Man052_Woman057_0413,pants yes but at the same time I think
Man052_Woman057_0414,it's important to mention that we do
Man052_Woman057_0415,still feel like we're individuals oh you
Man052_Woman057_0416,did that whole and we enjoy time apart
Man052_Woman057_0417,yeah time apart it's great you know we
Man052_Woman057_0418,travel and work yeah separately hey how
Man052_Woman057_0419,did your friends you know right

Man052_Woman057_0425,understand remember yeah you know I
Man052_Woman057_0426,think it's important to also have in a
Man052_Woman057_0427,relationship it's important to have your
Man052_Woman057_0428,own interest and you're your own friend
Man052_Woman057_0429,like a set of friends like a guy you can
Man052_Woman057_0430,go and have a beer with and you know
Man052_Woman057_0431,it's important to be your own individual
Man052_Woman057_0432,as well and not you know I can call you
Man052_Woman057_0433,and say hey you know I'm gonna go and
Man052_Woman057_0434,have a drink with my friend and you'll
Man052_Woman057_0435,be like okay have fun say hello whatever
Man052_Woman057_0436,you know
Man052_Woman057_0437,[Music]
Man052_Woman057_0438,whose turn is it did you maybe too much
Man052_Woman057_0439,I think it's like if I wasn't creative
Man052_Woman057_0440,or artistic would you still be with me
Man052_Woman057_0441,that's hard to answer but
Man052_Woman057_0442,because that's the motto
Man052_Woman057_0443,it's a backbone of our relationship but
Man052_Woman057_0444,probably I mean because I mean we work
Man052_Woman057_0445,with other people so we don't know we're
Man052_Woman057_0446,not we work with other people in our
Man052_Woman057_0447,relationship isn't always working
Man052_Woman057_0448,together it's just being together but
Man052_Woman057_0449,you see it's artistic is who we are
Man052_Woman057_0450,besides our work I don't think we would
Man052_Woman057_0451,be attracted to each other I do I think
Man052_Woman057_0452,so you think so I think so because who
Man052_Woman057_0453,we are is still separate from artwork
Man052_Woman057_0454,and our creativity yeah you know who we
Man052_Woman057_0455,are as people you know so I think so I
Man052_Woman057_0456,don't know you want accountant a
Man052_Woman057_0457,creative accountant right you would know
Man052_Woman057_0458,how to shuffle numbers artistically yes
Man052_Woman057_0459,how do we maybe met maybe not yeah I
Man052_Woman057_0460,mean I think I think us as an artist
Man052_Woman057_0461,it's a cool core who we are I think it
Man052_Woman057_0462,it is it's one of the threads that keeps
Man052_Woman057_0463,us together yes it's a thing that in
Man052_Woman057_0464,common yeah but I think we would still
Man052_Woman057_0465,be physically attracted to each other
Man052_Woman057_0466,and maybe find another common ground but
Man052_Woman057_0467,yes what would you change about my work
Man052_Woman057_0468,I think that would be a question for
Man052_Woman057_0469,past more and I think that's something
Man052_Woman057_0470,that you already solved what I would
Man052_Woman057_0471,change about your work is something that
Man052_Woman057_0472,you already changed its you stopped
Man052_Woman057_0473,trying to conform and make art that you
Man052_Woman057_0474,think other people would make happy
Man052_Woman057_0475,because every time you know you were
Man052_Woman057_0476,like okay I'm going to
Man052_Woman057_0477,some clean beauty so I can get some jobs
Man052_Woman057_0478,and blah blah blah blah it never worked
Man052_Woman057_0479,you know and I would always say to you
Man052_Woman057_0480,you need to believe in that photograph
Man052_Woman057_0481,you need to that photograph needs to
Man052_Woman057_0482,like exude your soul it has to exude
Man052_Woman057_0483,your passion and that's every time you
Man052_Woman057_0484,ever did something that was purely you
Man052_Woman057_0485,was always the thing bestest that got
Man052_Woman057_0486,you the best response even if it scared
Man052_Woman057_0487,you even stuck with it and that's like
Man052_Woman057_0488,that pastels story you know you said
Man052_Woman057_0489,you're gonna color the girl's hair pink
Man052_Woman057_0490,you know
Man052_Woman057_0491,oh no horrible this and that and
Man052_Woman057_0492,actually that's what made it special but
Man052_Woman057_0493,the fact that you stuck to your guns and
Man052_Woman057_0494,you you had your instincts it's what it
Man052_Woman057_0495,is something that I told you to change
Man052_Woman057_0496,and you knew that you had to change too
Man052_Woman057_0497,you know and the most creative with the
Man052_Woman057_0498,craziest stuff that you believed in are
Man052_Woman057_0499,the ones that got your jobs and got your
Man052_Woman057_0500,awards and all of that stuff
Man052_Woman057_0501,the last time you compromised for me how
Man052_Woman057_0502,did you feel about it anytime I
Man052_Woman057_0503,compromised for you it feels good
Man052_Woman057_0504,because because we're such a team and
Man052_Woman057_0505,that's what made us a team is
Man052_Woman057_0506,compromising and so killing me sorry is
Man052_Woman057_0507,it you oh that's our accountant yeah
Man052_Woman057_0508,yeah yeah I should we start over yeah I
Man052_Woman057_0509,mean so do you want to just cut it yeah
Man052_Woman057_0510,so the last time the last time you
Man052_Woman057_0511,compromise for me how did you feel about
Man052_Woman057_0512,it so you were saying it feels good
Man052_Woman057_0513,because that's what made our
Man052_Woman057_0514,relationship strong in the first place
Man052_Woman057_0515,so when I compromise or when you
Man052_Woman057_0516,compromise it feels that it's one more
Man052_Woman057_0517,act of strengthening our relationship
Man052_Woman057_0518,and learning throughout the years
Man052_Woman057_0519,learning the power of compromise was you
Man052_Woman057_0520,know really oh you know wonderful thing
Man052_Woman057_0521,for me personally because it helped it
Man052_Woman057_0522,helped elsewhere in life you know it
Man052_Woman057_0523,helped elsewhere in life to compromise
Man052_Woman057_0524,and the fact that we we stuck together
Man052_Woman057_0525,and compromised with each other was
Man052_Woman057_0526,eye-opening in a sense for me to see how
Man052_Woman057_0527,that worked and see how it worked
Man052_Woman057_0528,successfully yeah and you helped me to
Man052_Woman057_0529,understand what compromise really is and
Man052_Woman057_0530,you showed me first with the compromise
Man052_Woman057_0531,and then it took me a minute oh that's
Man052_Woman057_0532,how compromise works and that's what you
Man052_Woman057_0533,do you know it's for the other person
Man052_Woman057_0534,but for you as well and if the other
Man052_Woman057_0535,person doesn't see
Man052_Woman057_0536,reciprocate then that's when you run
Man052_Woman057_0537,into a problem but you had you know
Man052_Woman057_0538,don't wait for the reciprocation
Man052_Woman057_0539,anticipate it but you notice notice
Man052_Woman057_0540,through time if it comes back to you
Man052_Woman057_0541,yeah that's when you get that back and
Man052_Woman057_0542,forth yeah it's a conversation right
Man052_Woman057_0543,it's of actions actions yes and it's
Man052_Woman057_0544,also goes back to letting go you have to
Man052_Woman057_0545,control right you know and I think it's
Man052_Woman057_0546,it's I think it's a core of our
Man052_Woman057_0547,relationship right it's compromised a
Man052_Woman057_0548,little I've seen so many relationships
Man052_Woman057_0549,fail over the years yeah and they failed
Man052_Woman057_0550,to compromise or honest and even fail to
Man052_Woman057_0551,compromise but you had to like I did
Man052_Woman057_0552,initially understand what compromise
Man052_Woman057_0553,means yeah and that's you know something
Man052_Woman057_0554,that I think I've learned for my mom and
Man052_Woman057_0555,yeah you know just going through life
Man052_Woman057_0556,and losing things so many times so many
Man052_Woman057_0557,often you had to compromise in order to
Man052_Woman057_0558,survive and communicate again it all
Man052_Woman057_0559,goes back to communication you can't
Man052_Woman057_0560,expect people to be mind reader's you
Man052_Woman057_0561,know you have to tell them how I feel
Man052_Woman057_0562,you know really resolves a lots of
Man052_Woman057_0563,things yeah
Man052_Woman057_0564,yeah when was the last time you felt
Man052_Woman057_0565,suffocated in relay in this relationship
Man052_Woman057_0566,and why I think I was suffocated on the
Man052_Woman057_0567,beginning of our relationship but that
Man052_Woman057_0568,had nothing to do now looking back you
Man052_Woman057_0569,know I just lost somebody I loved and
Man052_Woman057_0570,you know went through a death and
Man052_Woman057_0571,complete breakdown of my life and
Man052_Woman057_0572,suddenly I have this new relationship
Man052_Woman057_0573,that makes me fearful and I didn't know
Man052_Woman057_0574,who I was so I think the demon is inside
Man052_Woman057_0575,of me and I've always been inside of me
Man052_Woman057_0576,when it comes to feeling suffocated as
Man052_Woman057_0577,you know from my past experiences
Man052_Woman057_0578,whenever I felt like my personal freedom
Man052_Woman057_0579,and independence is being compromised or
Man052_Woman057_0580,I'm getting in too deep I would
Man052_Woman057_0581,literally pack the bags and move to
Man052_Woman057_0582,another city and I did it to you too I
Man052_Woman057_0583,packed the bags and moved to New York
Man052_Woman057_0584,from Atlanta but the difference was that
Man052_Woman057_0585,you followed and honestly I have not
Man052_Woman057_0586,felt connected to you the way I should
Man052_Woman057_0587,not until you moved to New York with me
Man052_Woman057_0588,and when we started really truly living
Man052_Woman057_0589,together and when you showed me that you
Man052_Woman057_0590,are this incredible person that can
Man052_Woman057_0591,compromise that can communicate and that
Man052_Woman057_0592,you are able to still let me be Who I am
Man052_Woman057_0593,which was a big big part of who I am you
Man052_Woman057_0594,know is having that freedom to just have
Man052_Woman057_0595,my own opinions and my thoughts and my
Man052_Woman057_0596,schedule and my solitude and suddenly I
Man052_Woman057_0597,was like wait a second this guy is like
Man052_Woman057_0598,not choking me with constant need for
Man052_Woman057_0599,attention you just expect
Man052_Woman057_0600,yeah because that's what I'm used to by
Man052_Woman057_0601,Nature yeah it's my nature you know and
Man052_Woman057_0602,and you kind of silently showed me that
Man052_Woman057_0603,I can trust you and little by little you
Man052_Woman057_0604,tame the Beast you know and I commend
Man052_Woman057_0605,you for that immensely you're just such
Man052_Woman057_0606,an incredible person you're like you
Man052_Woman057_0607,know I think I always thought of myself
Man052_Woman057_0608,as water
Man052_Woman057_0609,you know I'm fluid and I but I take
Man052_Woman057_0610,shape of the container that I'm in and I
Man052_Woman057_0611,feel like you and I are that bottle and
Man052_Woman057_0612,that water that kind of pours into one
Man052_Woman057_0613,another and we change sometimes you are
Man052_Woman057_0614,the water and sometimes I'm the
Man052_Woman057_0615,container and vice versa and and somehow
Man052_Woman057_0616,we keep that essence of ourselves but
Man052_Woman057_0617,but take the shape of whatever container
Man052_Woman057_0618,we're being poured in and I think that's
Man052_Woman057_0619,what our relationship is and it's
Man052_Woman057_0620,beautiful it's like thank you for that
Man052_Woman057_0621,journey no thank you no thank you and
Man052_Woman057_0622,that's good I think that definitely
Man052_Woman057_0623,keeps us moving forward
