Woman101_Woman102_0001,that's not it it's super close it was
Woman101_Woman102_0002,pretty close I need the rest of my
Woman101_Woman102_0003,clothes we're going to get to that point
Woman101_Woman102_0004,I know it's really sweaty it's really
Woman101_Woman102_0005,humid outside she's fixing me okay
Woman101_Woman102_0006,fixing me okay
Woman101_Woman102_0007,[Laughter]
Woman101_Woman102_0008,okay was that 30 I know I was trying to
Woman101_Woman102_0009,count but then I lost count
Woman101_Woman102_0010,okay yeah hmm all right what do you
Woman101_Woman102_0011,remember about the first time we met in
Woman101_Woman102_0012,detail
Woman101_Woman102_0013,dude the first time we met I feel like I
Woman101_Woman102_0014,have to tell the leader right
Woman101_Woman102_0015,maybe yes probably quickly but I think
Woman101_Woman102_0016,I'm more interested to know you're
Woman101_Woman102_0017,exactly my emotional feeling great well
Woman101_Woman102_0018,there were many days in which the two of
Woman101_Woman102_0019,us had been obviously incorrectly
Woman101_Woman102_0020,identified as one another yeah at
Woman101_Woman102_0021,nauseam and so by the time the moment
Woman101_Woman102_0022,arrived which was literally if I recall
Woman101_Woman102_0023,correctly at a giant party in France
Woman101_Woman102_0024,where we literally bumped into the backs
Woman101_Woman102_0025,of one another mm-hmm that's how I
Woman101_Woman102_0026,remember it
Woman101_Woman102_0027,so it wasn't we were inside of the
Woman101_Woman102_0028,conference and somebody brought you past
Woman101_Woman102_0029,me I was like oh this is Tamara I can't
Woman101_Woman102_0030,remember who it was
Woman101_Woman102_0031,okay see in my mind I'm like it was like
Woman101_Woman102_0032,I'm dancing we're drinking there was
Woman101_Woman102_0033,that I weren't this party and I back up
Woman101_Woman102_0034,and I got right there you don't remember
Woman101_Woman102_0035,but like in fairness it was probably a
Woman101_Woman102_0036,few hours later okay not a big gap in
Woman101_Woman102_0037,difference and I remember in the moment
Woman101_Woman102_0038,though that I met you thinking this is
Woman101_Woman102_0039,the girl that I heard about and I'm
Woman101_Woman102_0040,either gonna love her we're gonna be
Woman101_Woman102_0041,arch-nemesis forever you know to mine
Woman101_Woman102_0042,I'm reading you and you're reading me
Woman101_Woman102_0043,and then suddenly I saw you smile where
Woman101_Woman102_0044,I smiled first whatever happened in
Woman101_Woman102_0045,whatever order I knew that it was
Woman101_Woman102_0046,instantaneous like okay yeah no cuz I
Woman101_Woman102_0047,didn't have that right away because you
Woman101_Woman102_0048,don't remember when we first actually
Woman101_Woman102_0049,met which was when somebody introduced
Woman101_Woman102_0050,inside of this conference and I was like
Woman101_Woman102_0051,oh that's her how can so many people

Woman101_Woman102_0181,champagne am I gonna happen in and then
Woman101_Woman102_0182,your head pops up out walk process it

Woman101_Woman102_0195,drunk oh the dumbest thing oh my god I
Woman101_Woman102_0196,want to think of something amazing right
Woman101_Woman102_0197,now
Woman101_Woman102_0198,I feel like there's probably been a time
Woman101_Woman102_0199,when you were like no my records we got
Woman101_Woman102_0200,to get my records uh insisting they were
Woman101_Woman102_0201,somewhere they weren't or yeah something
Woman101_Woman102_0202,along the lines of losing property and
Woman101_Woman102_0203,not actually knowing what happened to it
Woman101_Woman102_0204,but thinking that you know what happened
Woman101_Woman102_0205,to it I feel like there's something like
Woman101_Woman102_0206,that
Woman101_Woman102_0207,maybe a few things like that sorry I
Woman101_Woman102_0208,don't know you you you tend to get
Woman101_Woman102_0209,sometimes a little aggro when you're
Woman101_Woman102_0210,drunk so some high kicks that maybe went
Woman101_Woman102_0211,too far too high maybe maybe like a
Woman101_Woman102_0212,little bit too physically aggressive in
Woman101_Woman102_0213,a dance setting I would say that that's
Woman101_Woman102_0214,probably happened a few times that's
Woman101_Woman102_0215,kind of your STIs too high high kick
Woman101_Woman102_0216,yeah absolutely
Woman101_Woman102_0217,we're not counting like guys and this
Woman101_Woman102_0218,right no no I would say it's a pretty
Woman101_Woman102_0219,fair assessment to say that most of the
Woman101_Woman102_0220,guys that have been involved in my life
Woman101_Woman102_0221,when I was drunk we're stupid yeah you
Woman101_Woman102_0222,said it I didn't Oh what do I do men
Woman101_Woman102_0223,annoys you
Woman101_Woman102_0224,hmm hmm it's a tough one because we've
Woman101_Woman102_0225,been friends for so long we've lived
Woman101_Woman102_0226,together for so long on and off now
Woman101_Woman102_0227,three countries over the course of ten
Woman101_Woman102_0228,years on and off that I think we've
Woman101_Woman102_0229,learned to really choose our battles and
Woman101_Woman102_0230,there are just things that yeah but I
Woman101_Woman102_0231,definitely know what you so I know I
Woman101_Woman102_0232,know okay let me think okay what annoys
Woman101_Woman102_0233,me about you well I was annoyed
Woman101_Woman102_0234,yesterday when he told me you didn't
Woman101_Woman102_0235,like the scent of my Palo Santo incense
Woman101_Woman102_0236,I know what annoys me this is so stupid
Woman101_Woman102_0237,it's meaningless but you always have
Woman101_Woman102_0238,your travel bag hanging on the tire I
Woman101_Woman102_0239,knew that are you traveling make up your
Woman101_Woman102_0240,mind it's like I think tably knew that

Woman101_Woman102_0249,that's seriously like there's nothing
Woman101_Woman102_0250,major I mean what annoys me about myself
Woman101_Woman102_0251,is when I see you able to just relax and
Woman101_Woman102_0252,be laid back and have a really good time
Woman101_Woman102_0253,and give zero fucks and I am uptight
Woman101_Woman102_0254,sometimes and have a really hard time
Woman101_Woman102_0255,getting out of my head and just letting
Woman101_Woman102_0256,loose so that's not an annoyance with
Woman101_Woman102_0257,you it's an annoyance with myself right
Woman101_Woman102_0258,because I can see how easily you can go
Woman101_Woman102_0259,there see how easily I can lay in a
Woman101_Woman102_0260,couch for six hours it is fucking
Woman101_Woman102_0261,amazing it's a talent it is a talent
Woman101_Woman102_0262,yeah there's an acquired skill set that

Woman101_Woman102_0264,there all right yeah just have to stop
Woman101_Woman102_0265,exercising

Woman101_Woman102_0272,that nope now that's that literally
Woman101_Woman102_0273,there with them both it wouldn't have
Woman101_Woman102_0274,five-foot radius of each other that's
Woman101_Woman102_0275,amazing what's your secret go-to weapon
Woman101_Woman102_0276,and cheering me up that I'm not aware
Woman101_Woman102_0277,that you're using
Woman101_Woman102_0278,great question distraction I mean just
Woman101_Woman102_0279,like changing the subject like mm-hmm
Woman101_Woman102_0280,I don't know just not letting not
Woman101_Woman102_0281,letting your obvious annoyance or bad
Woman101_Woman102_0282,mood or something bad that you're
Woman101_Woman102_0283,feeling if you're sad or if you're upset
Woman101_Woman102_0284,just kind of even though I've heard you
Woman101_Woman102_0285,and I've processed it I just don't
Woman101_Woman102_0286,process it on the outside like I just
Woman101_Woman102_0287,don't think it helps you to like get
Woman101_Woman102_0288,into that hole with you know right I
Woman101_Woman102_0289,don't and I just move it on to something
Woman101_Woman102_0290,else because it's ultimately that's what
Woman101_Woman102_0291,you need and want I think there's lots
Woman101_Woman102_0292,of just but lots of cheering up weapons
Woman101_Woman102_0293,that we both use it we're aware of
Woman101_Woman102_0294,cheese cheese wine wine cheese chocolate
Woman101_Woman102_0295,chocolate standard Game of Thrones games
Woman101_Woman102_0296,and Dateline it's way more Dateline than
Woman101_Woman102_0297,anything I am happy to share that with
Woman101_Woman102_0298,the world
Woman101_Woman102_0299,don't care okay I told everyone now Oh
Woman101_Woman102_0300,God
Woman101_Woman102_0301,when I look in the mirror what do you
Woman101_Woman102_0302,think is the first thing I criticize
Woman101_Woman102_0303,well that's a tough one but I mean I
Woman101_Woman102_0304,think that we are both hyper aware that
Woman101_Woman102_0305,we're critical of ourselves and we are
Woman101_Woman102_0306,aware enough and open enough with each
Woman101_Woman102_0307,other that we share that with one of
Woman101_Woman102_0308,them we've shared many times what it is
Woman101_Woman102_0309,in this horrible mantra that goes over
Woman101_Woman102_0310,and over and over and are just as women
Woman101_Woman102_0311,as humans it's a thing you know I think
Woman101_Woman102_0312,that when you look in the mirror
Woman101_Woman102_0313,potentially the thing that you criticize
Woman101_Woman102_0314,yourself for is you know just something
Woman101_Woman102_0315,we all do I think which is getting older
Woman101_Woman102_0316,and just you've said to me before that
Woman101_Woman102_0317,you aren't happy with what you see and I
Woman101_Woman102_0318,hate that because I know should be yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0319,I think we could cut I think you could
Woman101_Woman102_0320,have caught a little more to the chase
Woman101_Woman102_0321,but yeah I mean in general you know you
Woman101_Woman102_0322,know I have lots of criticisms of myself
Woman101_Woman102_0323,so maybe it would be hard to pin one
Woman101_Woman102_0324,down but yeah that's a hard one because
Woman101_Woman102_0325,I think that is something I struggle
Woman101_Woman102_0326,with a lot and it's hard for you to even
Woman101_Woman102_0327,come near a because you'd so want me not
Woman101_Woman102_0328,to feel that way of course but I feel
Woman101_Woman102_0329,the same way I have my own criticism out
Woman101_Woman102_0330,there on repeat all the time I know like
Woman101_Woman102_0331,I would literally love to smack them out
Woman101_Woman102_0332,of you right exactly because if it was
Woman101_Woman102_0333,you as a real friend who was talking to
Woman101_Woman102_0334,me that harshly I'd be like later go we
Woman101_Woman102_0335,would never put up with that type of
Woman101_Woman102_0336,conversation from a real person in our
Woman101_Woman102_0337,lives we would say I'm dying you know
Woman101_Woman102_0338,but because it's ourselves or at least
Woman101_Woman102_0339,we think that it's our inner voice we
Woman101_Woman102_0340,allow it to be persistent and loud and
Woman101_Woman102_0341,you know what I hope for you I hope
Woman101_Woman102_0342,you're able to turn that volume level
Woman101_Woman102_0343,down yeah right yeah it's a challenge
Woman101_Woman102_0344,okay your turn
Woman101_Woman102_0345,mmm what do you think I'm most worried
Woman101_Woman102_0346,about right now
Woman101_Woman102_0347,family 100% yep yep it's no two ways
Woman101_Woman102_0348,about it you worry about them all the
Woman101_Woman102_0349,time and now is no different but it's
Woman101_Woman102_0350,heightened heavily it's not a hard
Woman101_Woman102_0351,question yes sir do you want to ask me
Woman101_Woman102_0352,yeah what are you worried about the nice
Woman101_Woman102_0353,ring mmm I honestly don't know there's a
Woman101_Woman102_0354,lot going on and I'm not worried about
Woman101_Woman102_0355,anything that it's weird I think you
Woman101_Woman102_0356,know that everything's gonna be fine I
Woman101_Woman102_0357,think I know even with my family
Woman101_Woman102_0358,everything's gonna be fine yeah but it's
Woman101_Woman102_0359,a persistent thing because you there's a
Woman101_Woman102_0360,lot of open-ended questions they don't
Woman101_Woman102_0361,have answers and I think we both like to
Woman101_Woman102_0362,try to like get things moving fix things
Woman101_Woman102_0363,make things happen and sometimes you
Woman101_Woman102_0364,just have to be patient and it's really
Woman101_Woman102_0365,hard yeah simple answer there always
Woman101_Woman102_0366,know if there's one thing that I still
Woman101_Woman102_0367,don't understand about you what is it
Woman101_Woman102_0368,[Music]
Woman101_Woman102_0369,I think you try to understand and it's
Woman101_Woman102_0370,not your fault but for me to translate
Woman101_Woman102_0371,the type of it's just our life
Woman101_Woman102_0372,experiences you know you can only tell
Woman101_Woman102_0373,somebody what happened to you or what
Woman101_Woman102_0374,your experience was or the way you felt
Woman101_Woman102_0375,when this other thing happened or
Woman101_Woman102_0376,whatever you can only share that with
Woman101_Woman102_0377,somebody and expect them to understand
Woman101_Woman102_0378,so much and that's in any kind of
Woman101_Woman102_0379,relationship so I would say that it's
Woman101_Woman102_0380,not a judgment on you it's just the
Woman101_Woman102_0381,facts of life like I think when I
Woman101_Woman102_0382,reference things that have happened in
Woman101_Woman102_0383,my life particularly the type of trial
Woman101_Woman102_0384,that I had things I experienced mm-hmm I
Woman101_Woman102_0385,feel like the difference would be that
Woman101_Woman102_0386,sometimes I think that you can't
Woman101_Woman102_0387,necessarily understand my life
Woman101_Woman102_0388,experiences yeah because our childhoods
Woman101_Woman102_0389,were similar in some ways and very
Woman101_Woman102_0390,different in other ways yeah that makes
Woman101_Woman102_0391,sense I agree it's not a judgement no I
Woman101_Woman102_0392,agree that's what I still don't
Woman101_Woman102_0393,understand I totally agree it's hard you
Woman101_Woman102_0394,can't you can't necessarily have just
Woman101_Woman102_0395,had the same formative years as somebody
Woman101_Woman102_0396,it's just you can try to understand and
Woman101_Woman102_0397,you can try to put yourself in someone's
Woman101_Woman102_0398,shoes and I try to do that with you all
Woman101_Woman102_0399,the time but I don't know if anybody
Woman101_Woman102_0400,ever really totally understands the
Woman101_Woman102_0401,first 25 years of someone's life and how
Woman101_Woman102_0402,much that contributes to the way they
Woman101_Woman102_0403,react to things now 100 percent
Woman101_Woman102_0404,especially when it's so different from
Woman101_Woman102_0405,your own I mean different not totally
Woman101_Woman102_0406,different but different enough it's not
Woman101_Woman102_0407,enough but isn't that the great thing
Woman101_Woman102_0408,about friendship right it's not like we
Woman101_Woman102_0409,are in a department and relationship
Woman101_Woman102_0410,together and so I think when you're in
Woman101_Woman102_0411,relationship and you're like why don't
Woman101_Woman102_0412,you understand this thing that happened
Woman101_Woman102_0413,to me way that I was raised or the
Woman101_Woman102_0414,things that happened in my life yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0415,it's a different frustration we have the
Woman101_Woman102_0416,luxury of being able to just go well we
Woman101_Woman102_0417,just won't understand each other that's
Woman101_Woman102_0418,fine
Woman101_Woman102_0419,yeah there's no consequences to that
Woman101_Woman102_0420,sometimes nobody sleeping on the couch
Woman101_Woman102_0421,you never in bedrooms yeah okay it's
Woman101_Woman102_0422,your trip
Woman101_Woman102_0423,well I want to ask you the same thing oh
Woman101_Woman102_0424,yeah what it would be the same is that
Woman101_Woman102_0425,yeah totally
Woman101_Woman102_0426,I mean it's it's too just I think but I
Woman101_Woman102_0427,think you do understand that it's
Woman101_Woman102_0428,different yeah but at the same time you
Woman101_Woman102_0429,can't possibly understand what it was
Woman101_Woman102_0430,like for me either
Woman101_Woman102_0431,so I just don't think that that's oh I
Woman101_Woman102_0432,wouldn't say it's a failure on either
Woman101_Woman102_0433,one of our parts it's just how it is
Woman101_Woman102_0434,absolutely but we try no what do you
Woman101_Woman102_0435,think you could what do you wish you
Woman101_Woman102_0436,could change about your childhood yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0437,for my parents to have stayed together
Woman101_Woman102_0438,or no let me rephrase that for them to
Woman101_Woman102_0439,have gotten it right the first time but
Woman101_Woman102_0440,I think that's pretty standard I mean
Woman101_Woman102_0441,for anybody who comes from a divorced
Woman101_Woman102_0442,home it just creates all these other
Woman101_Woman102_0443,spin-offs of malfunction dysfunction
Woman101_Woman102_0444,whatever I mean not to say that it's a
Woman101_Woman102_0445,worse situation it's probably in some
Woman101_Woman102_0446,ways better but but you know just
Woman101_Woman102_0447,naively assuming that you could do it
Woman101_Woman102_0448,and just wave a magic wand you'd at
Woman101_Woman102_0449,least want to see how things would go if
Woman101_Woman102_0450,it hadn't been broken up like that yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0451,for you yeah I mean for me I would say
Woman101_Woman102_0452,that
Woman101_Woman102_0453,I would want to probably be involved
Woman101_Woman102_0454,less in adult situations for sure I
Woman101_Woman102_0455,think that I you know I'm a product of
Woman101_Woman102_0456,young parents who got married young who
Woman101_Woman102_0457,are lovely amazing people but as a
Woman101_Woman102_0458,result there was a lack of filtration
Woman101_Woman102_0459,and therefore a lot of things
Woman101_Woman102_0460,experiences moments conversations words
Woman101_Woman102_0461,feelings were then translated over into
Woman101_Woman102_0462,my world and I was immediately you know
Woman101_Woman102_0463,engaged in a part of their world at a
Woman101_Woman102_0464,very young age so if I could change
Woman101_Woman102_0465,anything I would it would be great to
Woman101_Woman102_0466,not have that kind of you know
Woman101_Woman102_0467,involvement at such a young age
Woman101_Woman102_0468,mm-hmm that's what I would wish for you
Woman101_Woman102_0469,too yeah yeah okay so okay
Woman101_Woman102_0470,what's a compromise you've made that I
Woman101_Woman102_0471,failed to recognize and really should
Woman101_Woman102_0472,hire are in relationship to our
Woman101_Woman102_0473,friendship
Woman101_Woman102_0474,um I think you recognize all the
Woman101_Woman102_0475,compromise I don't think that you're the
Woman101_Woman102_0476,kind of person that wouldn't recognize a
Woman101_Woman102_0477,compromise
Woman101_Woman102_0478,you're pretty good about that this is
Woman101_Woman102_0479,definitely this thought makes me sound
Woman101_Woman102_0480,like an absolute psycho but you know
Woman101_Woman102_0481,you're such an amazing homemaker and
Woman101_Woman102_0482,it's just so not my thing
Woman101_Woman102_0483,shut up yeah you know I wouldn't call
Woman101_Woman102_0484,like the brunch is a compromise I
Woman101_Woman102_0485,wouldn't call that a compromise though I
Woman101_Woman102_0486,would say like that's like a no-brainer
Woman101_Woman102_0487,what you mean then when I've had people
Woman101_Woman102_0488,over for me
Woman101_Woman102_0489,yeah that's not a compromise for me it's
Woman101_Woman102_0490,nice I'm glad you do it I you know
Woman101_Woman102_0491,special occasions and stuff but I think
Woman101_Woman102_0492,just in our daily life I feel like I'm
Woman101_Woman102_0493,participating in this like we have a
Woman101_Woman102_0494,home that's like really functional I'm
Woman101_Woman102_0495,like amazing I'm just like I don't
Woman101_Woman102_0496,really care we're using China it don't
Woman101_Woman102_0497,really share like we're using the
Woman101_Woman102_0498,appropriate yeah yeah hey don't get too
Woman101_Woman102_0499,fancy on me oh yeah I feel like I'm just
Woman101_Woman102_0500,like constantly like yes I can pretend
Woman101_Woman102_0501,that I need a fork and a knife for this
Woman101_Woman102_0502,meal when I liked old bachelor out like
Woman101_Woman102_0503,otherwise it's gonna be totally happy
Woman101_Woman102_0504,and it's like you feel like you're
Woman101_Woman102_0505,taking care of us and it is nice though
Woman101_Woman102_0506,like no yeah I definitely need a salad
Woman101_Woman102_0507,bowl and a plate for this meal I need a
Woman101_Woman102_0508,napkin
Woman101_Woman102_0509,I need all those things bring this to me
Woman101_Woman102_0510,thank you I have problems okay you know
Woman101_Woman102_0511,what's a compromise I mean
Woman101_Woman102_0512,well I don't find anything compromising
Woman101_Woman102_0513,but yeah I mean okay you're bright I
Woman101_Woman102_0514,guess that is exactly it
Woman101_Woman102_0515,like when I lived by myself prior to
Woman101_Woman102_0516,living with you and and I was when I was
Woman101_Woman102_0517,in Berlin I had regular like monthly
Woman101_Woman102_0518,like come over and have brunch for 15
Woman101_Woman102_0519,people and I'm gonna cook everything
Woman101_Woman102_0520,having nothing yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0521,it's my style it's like what I enjoy let
Woman101_Woman102_0522,me feel creative it makes me feel like
Woman101_Woman102_0523,I'm going back I love to do I know that
Woman101_Woman102_0524,it isn't your for me flash it stresses
Woman101_Woman102_0525,you out so which is fine
Woman101_Woman102_0526,this is what happens when you have life
Woman101_Woman102_0527,partnered with somebody for so long you
Woman101_Woman102_0528,recognize that there are battles you can
Woman101_Woman102_0529,choose or not choose to participate in
Woman101_Woman102_0530,yeah and that's one and it's like it's
Woman101_Woman102_0531,like crying I don't care you know at
Woman101_Woman102_0532,this point like I'm planning a hangover
Woman101_Woman102_0533,that dang Oh super up on that couch
Woman101_Woman102_0534,don't work for me like a legitimate okay
Woman101_Woman102_0535,so anyway my turn over yet
Woman101_Woman102_0536,Oh what scares you the most these days
Woman101_Woman102_0537,what scares me mmm-hmm what scares me
Woman101_Woman102_0538,Millennials yeah yeah I think you're
Woman101_Woman102_0539,technically r1 I'm not I missed it by
Woman101_Woman102_0540,one year I what am I scared of
Woman101_Woman102_0541,the Republican yeah terrifying put that
Woman101_Woman102_0542,in a compartment like most 35 year old
Woman101_Woman102_0543,women I'm scared of is it going to
Woman101_Woman102_0544,happen am I gonna be in a relationship
Woman101_Woman102_0545,am I gonna have a baby one day I'm also
Woman101_Woman102_0546,scared of whether or not I'm sure if I
Woman101_Woman102_0547,even want that I don't know haven't made
Woman101_Woman102_0548,up my mind it requires for me anyway and
Woman101_Woman102_0549,my personal experience it requires the
Woman101_Woman102_0550,right partner I don't want to do it by
Woman101_Woman102_0551,myself
Woman101_Woman102_0552,right I know I can right I don't want to
Woman101_Woman102_0553,so the fear it's more of a fear not
Woman101_Woman102_0554,being scared isn't like boo you know but
Woman101_Woman102_0555,like I'm afraid perhaps that it may not
Woman101_Woman102_0556,happen so that would be the thing that's
Woman101_Woman102_0557,like a persistent thought that comes and
Woman101_Woman102_0558,goes it weaves in Bob's its way into my
Woman101_Woman102_0559,life yeah and I think I can speak for
Woman101_Woman102_0560,most of our friends who are women of the
Woman101_Woman102_0561,same age range single who wonder and
Woman101_Woman102_0562,fear the same thing hmm you know this is
Woman101_Woman102_0563,not just a personal fear it's a
Woman101_Woman102_0564,collective fear it's grandma's parents
Woman101_Woman102_0565,everyone who thinks society whatever
Woman101_Woman102_0566,that does a thing that you should be
Woman101_Woman102_0567,doing and also PS you have a biological
Woman101_Woman102_0568,clock and it's tick talking away yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0569,but I think science is gonna fix it for
Woman101_Woman102_0570,us
Woman101_Woman102_0571,yeah maybe hashtag signs have something
Woman101_Woman102_0572,science rules
Woman101_Woman102_0573,okay your turn okay what are you
Woman101_Woman102_0574,hesitant to tell me
Woman101_Woman102_0575,[Music]
Woman101_Woman102_0576,I am I mean like there's a lot like
Woman101_Woman102_0577,that's in a varying degree of like I ate
Woman101_Woman102_0578,the last of like a piece of cheese that
Woman101_Woman102_0579,you really liked too like how do we
Woman101_Woman102_0580,split it conceive the you know how we're
Woman101_Woman102_0581,gonna split up our stuff when we move
Woman101_Woman102_0582,that's a big I think a month away yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0583,it's crazy
Woman101_Woman102_0584,no I think like hesitant to tell you I
Woman101_Woman102_0585,mean I think it's hard you know we both
Woman101_Woman102_0586,they're really defensive in general like
Woman101_Woman102_0587,we've been mean that was well played I
Woman101_Woman102_0588,have to say boom boom yeah I think we
Woman101_Woman102_0589,both are hesitant to say anything to
Woman101_Woman102_0590,each other
Woman101_Woman102_0591,like that's too real or tough to hear
Woman101_Woman102_0592,especially because we know each other so
Woman101_Woman102_0593,well and we know what's gonna be hard to
Woman101_Woman102_0594,hear and sometimes those things still
Woman101_Woman102_0595,need to be said and I think we both are
Woman101_Woman102_0596,very timid because we both can be quite
Woman101_Woman102_0597,reactive we look together yeah we do but
Woman101_Woman102_0598,I don't know are you worse than other
Woman101_Woman102_0599,people maybe not maybe everybody's like
Woman101_Woman102_0600,that I don't know I feel like there are
Woman101_Woman102_0601,taboo topics between us and it's a fact
Woman101_Woman102_0602,and when we literally have a date night
Woman101_Woman102_0603,or a brunch day out we're really not in
Woman101_Woman102_0604,the confines of our apartment you know
Woman101_Woman102_0605,as spacious as it is it's important for
Woman101_Woman102_0606,us to remove ourselves from that space
Woman101_Woman102_0607,so that we can have conversations that
Woman101_Woman102_0608,we wouldn't have while we're just kind
Woman101_Woman102_0609,of like roaming back and forth between
Woman101_Woman102_0610,kitchen and couch yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0611,and I feel like we have I can name at
Woman101_Woman102_0612,least three or four times what we've

Woman101_Woman102_0647,of your life that you tell people and
Woman101_Woman102_0648,what's the real story as you see it now
Woman101_Woman102_0649,I tell people I'm an international woman
Woman101_Woman102_0650,of mystery
Woman101_Woman102_0651,I think for many years my story was very
Woman101_Woman102_0652,similar to yours and that's kind of how
Woman101_Woman102_0653,we connected like we both worked in
Woman101_Woman102_0654,dance music we both lived abroad we both
Woman101_Woman102_0655,worked with DJs I was a DJ that was a
Woman101_Woman102_0656,piece of my story for many years I
Woman101_Woman102_0657,worked with record labels I was a night
Woman101_Woman102_0658,owl I partied I went out I wasn't events
Woman101_Woman102_0659,I don't tell that story anymore because
Woman101_Woman102_0660,it isn't my story anymore I've
Woman101_Woman102_0661,transitioned to a new place where my
Woman101_Woman102_0662,story frankly isn't completely written
Woman101_Woman102_0663,and I'm okay with that I'm in the middle
Woman101_Woman102_0664,of figuring it all out but I know that
Woman101_Woman102_0665,who I was before no longer serves me it
Woman101_Woman102_0666,doesn't mean it was wrong or bad it just
Woman101_Woman102_0667,isn't me anymore
Woman101_Woman102_0668,yeah and that's okay yeah so I would say
Woman101_Woman102_0669,that the thing it's like when I tell it
Woman101_Woman102_0670,I'm still kind of defining it right it's
Woman101_Woman102_0671,all right for me I'm okay with that
Woman101_Woman102_0672,agreed you go okay what do you think I
Woman101_Woman102_0673,am looking for in a romantic Oh settle
Woman101_Woman102_0674,in for this one I know that you're
Woman101_Woman102_0675,looking for someone who takes care of
Woman101_Woman102_0676,you even though you really don't need it
Woman101_Woman102_0677,but they could and they want to even
Woman101_Woman102_0678,though they won't be able to yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0679,somebody was definitely the beard looks
Woman101_Woman102_0680,remotely like Jesus but bulkier less
Woman101_Woman102_0681,like you know sleep and food deprived
Woman101_Woman102_0682,yeah yeah and I think really you you're
Woman101_Woman102_0683,looking for someone who is totally I
Woman101_Woman102_0684,think you're looking for somebody who is
Woman101_Woman102_0685,the I think you're looking for somebody
Woman101_Woman102_0686,who's kind of at the driver's seat of a
Woman101_Woman102_0687,relationship but actually that will
Woman101_Woman102_0688,actually be you based on your
Woman101_Woman102_0689,personality
Woman101_Woman102_0690,that's interesting because I do want
Woman101_Woman102_0691,somebody who can be strong and that I
Woman101_Woman102_0692,can't push around so I don't know I
Woman101_Woman102_0693,can't say that I met anybody like that
Woman101_Woman102_0694,yet he puts me in my place he calls me
Woman101_Woman102_0695,out it's like I'm not like ya know I am
Woman101_Woman102_0696,I'm bossy by Nature I know I don't know
Woman101_Woman102_0697,how you bossy you're just headstrong
Woman101_Woman102_0698,headstrong yeah fair enough
Woman101_Woman102_0699,but being vulnerable is not my strength
Woman101_Woman102_0700,you know not I'm sure there's a wordplay
Woman101_Woman102_0701,in there that we're not yeah catching no
Woman101_Woman102_0702,but I don't think that you see you keep
Woman101_Woman102_0703,saying that I keep hearing you say that
Woman101_Woman102_0704,that you need to be vulnerable
Woman101_Woman102_0705,and I don't think you need to be
Woman101_Woman102_0706,vulnerable I think you need to find
Woman101_Woman102_0707,somebody who likes you exactly how you
Woman101_Woman102_0708,are I think it's really smarter than me
Woman101_Woman102_0709,to say okay I just don't know who that
Woman101_Woman102_0710,guy is well you know we're hiding it was
Woman101_Woman102_0711,like in a cave on some kind of weird
Woman101_Woman102_0712,like retreat really yeah I do
Woman101_Woman102_0713,wait what what do you what do you think
Woman101_Woman102_0714,yeah what are you looking for in a
Woman101_Woman102_0715,romantic relationship no what do you
Woman101_Woman102_0716,think I'm looking for what I think right
Woman101_Woman102_0717,yeah sorry I definitely think the guy
Woman101_Woman102_0718,that you were looking for makes you
Woman101_Woman102_0719,laugh like crazy he is funny and
Woman101_Woman102_0720,comfortable in my own skin yeah he knows
Woman101_Woman102_0721,who he is he can take it on the chin
Woman101_Woman102_0722,just as easily as he can give it back
Woman101_Woman102_0723,he's intelligent
Woman101_Woman102_0724,it's passionate about something doesn't
Woman101_Woman102_0725,matter what it is ideally it's also
Woman101_Woman102_0726,about music and some aspect he's
Woman101_Woman102_0727,creative in some way but he has his shit
Woman101_Woman102_0728,together um he can support you too but
Woman101_Woman102_0729,it's it's not about to be clear none of
Woman101_Woman102_0730,this is about like financial support or
Woman101_Woman102_0731,anything like that we've always taken
Woman101_Woman102_0732,care of ourselves that's what probably
Woman101_Woman102_0733,makes us hard to date frankly
Woman101_Woman102_0734,by yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0735,but he's somebody that can also be just
Woman101_Woman102_0736,by you accepted for who he is and he I
Woman101_Woman102_0737,hope that he's the kind of guy that
Woman101_Woman102_0738,makes you realize how beautiful and
Woman101_Woman102_0739,amazing that you are and how perfectly
Woman101_Woman102_0740,perfect you are the way Liz Miller is
Woman101_Woman102_0741,there's nothing to change Thanks
Woman101_Woman102_0742,okay does that make it I guess it's my
Woman101_Woman102_0743,turn
Woman101_Woman102_0744,what are you fearful of in a
Woman101_Woman102_0745,relationship
Woman101_Woman102_0746,um well therapy has taught me that I'm
Woman101_Woman102_0747,fearful that but if I let go completely
Woman101_Woman102_0748,and give myself it to someone in that I
Woman101_Woman102_0749,let my guard down
Woman101_Woman102_0750,I've always in a friendship even in most
Woman101_Woman102_0751,instances not with us but in even in
Woman101_Woman102_0752,work situations and so forth I keep one
Woman101_Woman102_0753,door in and one foot in the door in one
Woman101_Woman102_0754,foot out
Woman101_Woman102_0755,mm-hmm I believe I had to learn to
Woman101_Woman102_0756,protect myself at a young age to be wary
Woman101_Woman102_0757,to be careful and so that translates
Woman101_Woman102_0758,into relationships so to answer the
Woman101_Woman102_0759,question I'm fearful that if I let go
Woman101_Woman102_0760,completely that I will be really angry
Woman101_Woman102_0761,at myself for letting go I'll be angry
Woman101_Woman102_0762,at myself for not protecting myself
Woman101_Woman102_0763,because I knew better hmm
Woman101_Woman102_0764,and also I have done it before and I've
Woman101_Woman102_0765,completely let myself throw caution to
Woman101_Woman102_0766,the wind fall full-throttle
Woman101_Woman102_0767,wholeheartedly and you've watched me do
Woman101_Woman102_0768,it into relationships that were not
Woman101_Woman102_0769,right for me because I believed that it
Woman101_Woman102_0770,could be this thing that I wanted it to
Woman101_Woman102_0771,be a put it on a pedestal and thought
Woman101_Woman102_0772,that's going to work it's going to be
Woman101_Woman102_0773,awesome looking back I'm like was I
Woman101_Woman102_0774,thinking I'm not gonna name names but
Woman101_Woman102_0775,you know no I'm not either I do and it's
Woman101_Woman102_0776,just like wow but I'm so happy I did go
Woman101_Woman102_0777,through those things I needed to go
Woman101_Woman102_0778,through them to become who I
Woman101_Woman102_0779,now not that I'm like finalized finished
Woman101_Woman102_0780,product but I recognize that you know
Woman101_Woman102_0781,and that's that's the thing that I am
Woman101_Woman102_0782,most afraid of is letting go so when the
Woman101_Woman102_0783,guy is the right guy when it feels right
Woman101_Woman102_0784,when I feel like I can finally do it and
Woman101_Woman102_0785,I want to believe in myself that I can
Woman101_Woman102_0786,do it that I can let go and be you know
Woman101_Woman102_0787,22 years old again and just fall in love
Woman101_Woman102_0788,again yeah I don't want to be the
Woman101_Woman102_0789,hardened like lemon all who's afraid of
Woman101_Woman102_0790,like yeah there I also think you might
Woman101_Woman102_0791,be overthinking it
Woman101_Woman102_0792,jokes okay anymore wait we're so bad on
Woman101_Woman102_0793,too long thank you
Woman101_Woman102_0794,no I'm good I'm good thanks all right
Woman101_Woman102_0795,ready yep okay what do you think is my
Woman101_Woman102_0796,best and worst quality when it comes to
Woman101_Woman102_0797,a relationship this is the hard one
Woman101_Woman102_0798,since I've really have not been in a
Woman101_Woman102_0799,relationship besides with you I don't
Woman101_Woman102_0800,know there's like a few sprinkled
Woman101_Woman102_0801,mishaps best and worst best worst
Woman101_Woman102_0802,quality that comes really I think you
Woman101_Woman102_0803,should just just say as it defines to
Woman101_Woman102_0804,friendship okay yeah I think that makes
Woman101_Woman102_0805,more sense yeah I would think your best
Woman101_Woman102_0806,quality is that you are always there for
Woman101_Woman102_0807,your friends to a fault you are willing
Woman101_Woman102_0808,to you definitely want to support and be
Woman101_Woman102_0809,there for everyone and you have a lot of
Woman101_Woman102_0810,friends because you've lived in a lot of
Woman101_Woman102_0811,places and you are a great friend to
Woman101_Woman102_0812,have and therefore you nurture those
Woman101_Woman102_0813,friendships and they don't like just
Woman101_Woman102_0814,dissolve some do it's just the nature of
Woman101_Woman102_0815,life but so I think that that's great
Woman101_Woman102_0816,but I do think that there are some
Woman101_Woman102_0817,instances over the years where I have
Woman101_Woman102_0818,watched people treat you badly and you
Woman101_Woman102_0819,didn't give up on them that would be the
Woman101_Woman102_0820,way I would phrase it now but ten five
Woman101_Woman102_0821,even six years ago I would have said
Woman101_Woman102_0822,you'd let people walk all over you right
Woman101_Woman102_0823,and I feel that as a result of being
Woman101_Woman102_0824,your friend I have recognized that
Woman101_Woman102_0825,definitely there were some of those
Woman101_Woman102_0826,people who needed to just be cut for me
Woman101_Woman102_0827,alive that have eventually found their
Woman101_Woman102_0828,way to non no longer be in your life
Woman101_Woman102_0829,deservedly but at the time it frustrated
Woman101_Woman102_0830,me because I wanted you to be to care
Woman101_Woman102_0831,about yourself enough and what they had
Woman101_Woman102_0832,done to you to go no I don't deserve
Woman101_Woman102_0833,this
Woman101_Woman102_0834,I'm done I have other friends I don't
Woman101_Woman102_0835,need you in my life so now what I see is
Woman101_Woman102_0836,that there are some people who you hung
Woman101_Woman102_0837,on to and gave second third and fourth
Woman101_Woman102_0838,and fifth chances to you did and you've
Woman101_Woman102_0839,found a way through with them because
Woman101_Woman102_0840,they also have found a way to become a
Woman101_Woman102_0841,better human being right some of them
Woman101_Woman102_0842,were just not good people fact right and
Woman101_Woman102_0843,so yeah I think what has happened is my
Woman101_Woman102_0844,perception of what was good and bad
Woman101_Woman102_0845,about you and that way has changed does
Woman101_Woman102_0846,that make sense
Woman101_Woman102_0847,it's good that's nice to hear what do
Woman101_Woman102_0848,you think is the most important lesson
Woman101_Woman102_0849,I'm learning at this stage in my life no
Woman101_Woman102_0850,you're so like in charge of your life
Woman101_Woman102_0851,right now I don't feel like life is
Woman101_Woman102_0852,beating you down too much you've learned
Woman101_Woman102_0853,your value for work and I think you're
Woman101_Woman102_0854,learning a little bit more about how to
Woman101_Woman102_0855,well with your family thing I think it's
Woman101_Woman102_0856,a little bit a lesson that you'll learn
Woman101_Woman102_0857,soon about at what point it is and isn't
Woman101_Woman102_0858,your problem
Woman101_Woman102_0859,at what point you need to kind of just
Woman101_Woman102_0860,let people do what they need to do
Woman101_Woman102_0861,I don't know I think I hope that you're
Woman101_Woman102_0862,learning that you're gonna be okay I
Woman101_Woman102_0863,think that's what's kind of happening
Woman101_Woman102_0864,for you is that you are starting to feel
Woman101_Woman102_0865,like you are going to be okay and being
Woman101_Woman102_0866,able to try and breathe out a little bit
Woman101_Woman102_0867,yeah I think that's fair I think it's
Woman101_Woman102_0868,definitely like the way I feel right now
Woman101_Woman102_0869,it's very different to where how I felt
Woman101_Woman102_0870,a year ago yeah true and even you know
Woman101_Woman102_0871,let's go four or five years ago before I
Woman101_Woman102_0872,even lived in New York City like where
Woman101_Woman102_0873,was I then where am I now
Woman101_Woman102_0874,mhm Sam I mean I feel like New York has
Woman101_Woman102_0875,changed us immensely mm-hmm okay what do
Woman101_Woman102_0876,you think is special about our
Woman101_Woman102_0877,relationship the things I sometimes ask
Woman101_Woman102_0878,myself not not often but occasionally I
Woman101_Woman102_0879,think what must our friends or people
Woman101_Woman102_0880,who have only just met us think about
Woman101_Woman102_0881,our friendship
Woman101_Woman102_0882,and they're like I don't even know how
Woman101_Woman102_0883,to get up in there it's like it's like a
Woman101_Woman102_0884,force field you know codependent is the
Woman101_Woman102_0885,word that and then there's like old
Woman101_Woman102_0886,married couple
Woman101_Woman102_0887,oh maybe couple comes up a lot yeah like
Woman101_Woman102_0888,you know you don't like mushrooms and no
Woman101_Woman102_0889,do you really what happened
Woman101_Woman102_0890,yeah so I think we need to start turning
Woman101_Woman102_0891,these over so we don't forget special
Woman101_Woman102_0892,I think what's special is that we've
Woman101_Woman102_0893,stood the test of time I mean being
Woman101_Woman102_0894,friends for 10 years lots of people have
Woman101_Woman102_0895,been friends for 10 years with people
Woman101_Woman102_0896,that they know but I think for us what's
Woman101_Woman102_0897,unique and individual about that is that
Woman101_Woman102_0898,we have also lived together in multiple
Woman101_Woman102_0899,countries throughout that 10-year
Woman101_Woman102_0900,process who I was when you met me and
Woman101_Woman102_0901,who you were when I met you we were at
Woman101_Woman102_0902,our word so who we are but we have grown
Woman101_Woman102_0903,and changed so much you know
Woman101_Woman102_0904,and I think that often when you start to
Woman101_Woman102_0905,change as a human being you you you
Woman101_Woman102_0906,many people will push away from people
Woman101_Woman102_0907,who have known hit them the whole time
Woman101_Woman102_0908,because they know that they've changed
Woman101_Woman102_0909,and they don't know who to be an owl in
Woman101_Woman102_0910,front of this other person you are my
Woman101_Woman102_0911,mirror I know right that you will always
Woman101_Woman102_0912,remember who I was ten years ago versus
Woman101_Woman102_0913,who I wasn't middle and who I am right
Woman101_Woman102_0914,now you know me
Woman101_Woman102_0915,yeah and you're not judging me which is
Woman101_Woman102_0916,an amazing thing so I believe that's
Woman101_Woman102_0917,what's special about a friendship Thanks
Woman101_Woman102_0918,okay how do you think my family has
Woman101_Woman102_0919,influenced me as a person definitely
Woman101_Woman102_0920,made you feel overly responsible for
Woman101_Woman102_0921,other people's well-being yeah I think
Woman101_Woman102_0922,you maybe grew up a little too fast and
Woman101_Woman102_0923,you maybe have a really high bar set for
Woman101_Woman102_0924,yourself about the kind of superhuman
Woman101_Woman102_0925,you need to be right now in life and and
Woman101_Woman102_0926,how awesome and how like successful you
Woman101_Woman102_0927,need to be and be perceived in order to
Woman101_Woman102_0928,be okay and yeah I I wish I could I wish
Woman101_Woman102_0929,I could take some of that away from you
Woman101_Woman102_0930,because I think it's okay to be young
Woman101_Woman102_0931,and stupid and not have it all figured
Woman101_Woman102_0932,out I mean I still don't know how than
Woman101_Woman102_0933,you so yeah I mean I feel like my
Woman101_Woman102_0934,twenties were all about not carrying you
Woman101_Woman102_0935,know it was like super laissez-faire
Woman101_Woman102_0936,it's pretty fun
Woman101_Woman102_0937,it was super fun it wouldn't change any
Woman101_Woman102_0938,of it you know but when I think about
Woman101_Woman102_0939,the brevity of life and like the
Woman101_Woman102_0940,heaviness of it it was a completely
Woman101_Woman102_0941,different things were just as crazy you
Woman101_Woman102_0942,know in terms of my family and stuff but
Woman101_Woman102_0943,I mean it's just a different level of
Woman101_Woman102_0944,responsibility and care
Woman101_Woman102_0945,I think then it's true then at that time
Woman101_Woman102_0946,and then also as an adult who has a
Woman101_Woman102_0947,career and and whatever like you know
Woman101_Woman102_0948,there's also a different relationship
Woman101_Woman102_0949,with what you can do versus what was
Woman101_Woman102_0950,completely out of your grasp you know
Woman101_Woman102_0951,what I mean I think my twenties we're
Woman101_Woman102_0952,not in a time when I couldn't do pain
Woman101_Woman102_0953,right really to help but maybe listen
Woman101_Woman102_0954,when were you the proudest of me I mean
Woman101_Woman102_0955,getting your newest job that was a
Woman101_Woman102_0956,pretty big deal not just getting the job
Woman101_Woman102_0957,but like not listening to anybody else's
Woman101_Woman102_0958,feedback or input about what you
Woman101_Woman102_0959,deserved what kind of salary or what
Woman101_Woman102_0960,kind of title or whatever and just
Woman101_Woman102_0961,putting a super target on it and just
Woman101_Woman102_0962,making it happen for yourself I mean I
Woman101_Woman102_0963,don't know that's kind of like
Woman101_Woman102_0964,conventional like of course I'm proud of
Woman101_Woman102_0965,you because you were proud but I think
Woman101_Woman102_0966,I'm proud of you every time you're hyper
Woman101_Woman102_0967,considerate of a friend that is going
Woman101_Woman102_0968,through a hard time and you do something
Woman101_Woman102_0969,really thoughtful for them I mean to be
Woman101_Woman102_0970,honest that's the time when I'm more
Woman101_Woman102_0971,proud of you and maybe you're not proud
Woman101_Woman102_0972,of yourself you just feel like it's an
Woman101_Woman102_0973,obligatory thing that you should be
Woman101_Woman102_0974,doing I think yeah it's kind of a it's
Woman101_Woman102_0975,kind of a obvious answer to say the job
Woman101_Woman102_0976,but I think in truth it's the little
Woman101_Woman102_0977,moments where you're you know a really
Woman101_Woman102_0978,good friend to somebody even if as you
Woman101_Woman102_0979,have said maybe they don't deserve it
Woman101_Woman102_0980,that's cool that's weak to say
Woman101_Woman102_0981,you're welcome oh yeah ask me any
Woman101_Woman102_0982,question ask you any question I feel
Woman101_Woman102_0983,like I have asked you every question I
Woman101_Woman102_0984,asked you not today all right
Woman101_Woman102_0985,one year from now we will no longer be

Woman101_Woman102_0987,it's a thing like it's ran its course
Woman101_Woman102_0988,we've done our thing we'd never plan to
Woman101_Woman102_0989,live together ever anyway it was never a
Woman101_Woman102_0990,plan it happened circumstantial yeah
Woman101_Woman102_0991,boom we're living in London together
Woman101_Woman102_0992,boom we're living in Berlin together
Woman101_Woman102_0993,boom really right you weren't together
Woman101_Woman102_0994,Wow how did that ever happen
Woman101_Woman102_0995,so ask you anything would be one year
Woman101_Woman102_0996,from now yeah where do you see yourself
Woman101_Woman102_0997,and where do you see me like our
Woman101_Woman102_0998,relationship yeah well we both know how
Woman101_Woman102_0999,much I don't like to talk on the phone I
Woman101_Woman102_1000,mean I hope that we talk regularly I
Woman101_Woman102_1001,hope we talk every week at least I hope
Woman101_Woman102_1002,that you're you have a whole amazing
Woman101_Woman102_1003,group of friends out in LA that provides
Woman101_Woman102_1004,you with that sense of belonging that we
Woman101_Woman102_1005,haven't totally accomplished here or the
Woman101_Woman102_1006,way we had in London or even Berlin
Woman101_Woman102_1007,where you don't necessarily need me that
Woman101_Woman102_1008,much but obviously I'm still the most
Woman101_Woman102_1009,important opinion and and hopefully
Woman101_Woman102_1010,dating someone which I know you really
Woman101_Woman102_1011,want who is a real substantial
Woman101_Woman102_1012,possibility rather than a tinder
Woman101_Woman102_1013,situation I know I'm just saying it's
Woman101_Woman102_1014,just a term people use and
Woman101_Woman102_1015,I think that was my question
Woman101_Woman102_1016,oh yeah oh yeah you asked me what pain
Woman101_Woman102_1017,in me would you like to heal whoo it all
Woman101_Woman102_1018,deep feel like it's kind of like we're
Woman101_Woman102_1019,kind it's kind of all the same yeah I
Woman101_Woman102_1020,just wished that you know you were
Woman101_Woman102_1021,allowed to be more of a kid and allowed
Woman101_Woman102_1022,to you know allowed to just not carry
Woman101_Woman102_1023,the weight of your whole families
Woman101_Woman102_1024,everyone in the family's well-being on
Woman101_Woman102_1025,your shoulders because I do think that
Woman101_Woman102_1026,that kind of feeds into a bunch of other
Woman101_Woman102_1027,things definitely it's pretty basic yeah
Woman101_Woman102_1028,all right
Woman101_Woman102_1029,what do you think as well as this kind
Woman101_Woman102_1030,of doesn't ask me anything what do you
Woman101_Woman102_1031,think is the next step in our
Woman101_Woman102_1032,relationship so what do you think we
Woman101_Woman102_1033,have to separate our appliances you get
Woman101_Woman102_1034,everything in the kitchen you can have
Woman101_Woman102_1035,everything in the kitchen I think the
Woman101_Woman102_1036,next step is that we I want for us with
Woman101_Woman102_1037,just four or five four weeks left to
Woman101_Woman102_1038,live together mm-hmm
Woman101_Woman102_1039,to enjoy our time together you know it's
Woman101_Woman102_1040,really easy to get up and then get
Woman101_Woman102_1041,caught up in the conundrum of day to day
Woman101_Woman102_1042,like waking up being tired going to work
Woman101_Woman102_1043,coming home being tired like having our
Woman101_Woman102_1044,interaction whatever last night prints
Woman101_Woman102_1045,one of our heroes passed away you know
Woman101_Woman102_1046,and it's not what's really nice it just
Woman101_Woman102_1047,fit together
Woman101_Woman102_1048,it was great to records we wasn't
Woman101_Woman102_1049,printed in air DJ I could see about the
Woman101_Woman102_1050,streaming life human life right we would
Woman101_Woman102_1051,have had to buy the whole catalog thank
Woman101_Woman102_1052,God for vinyl yeah for one
Woman101_Woman102_1053,[Laughter]
Woman101_Woman102_1054,it's a second time though that one of
Woman101_Woman102_1055,our massive maths and music heroes has
Woman101_Woman102_1056,passed away and just in a few months and
Woman101_Woman102_1057,friends actually said that time isn't
Woman101_Woman102_1058,real it's a construct of the mind
Woman101_Woman102_1059,I'm sure than plenty of other people
Woman101_Woman102_1060,have said it but you know direct quote
Woman101_Woman102_1061,he said it and I think that for me we
Woman101_Woman102_1062,both know our friendships not going
Woman101_Woman102_1063,anywhere it's just about - it's about to
Woman101_Woman102_1064,evolve into a new phase in our lives you
Woman101_Woman102_1065,know you're never going to not be
Woman101_Woman102_1066,important to me you're never going to
Woman101_Woman102_1067,not be somebody that reach out to you
Woman101_Woman102_1068,and ask for an opinion or send a stupid
Woman101_Woman102_1069,gift - or like you know throw an
Woman101_Woman102_1070,underhanded emoji at it's just I I think
Woman101_Woman102_1071,that in the lot next to the next steps
Woman101_Woman102_1072,for us in our relationship to answer the
Woman101_Woman102_1073,question for me or just about
Woman101_Woman102_1074,recognizing how important we are to one
Woman101_Woman102_1075,another and enjoying the time that we
Woman101_Woman102_1076,have left we're gonna make time for each
Woman101_Woman102_1077,other we're gonna go play sit together
Woman101_Woman102_1078,we're gonna meet up in other countries
Woman101_Woman102_1079,and other cities and do fun things
Woman101_Woman102_1080,together it's always going to be a part
Woman101_Woman102_1081,of our life and I know that no matter
Woman101_Woman102_1082,whether relationships that come and go
Woman101_Woman102_1083,or kids come and go or whatever happens
Woman101_Woman102_1084,it's going to be a thing for us so I
Woman101_Woman102_1085,just don't want to let go of this like
Woman101_Woman102_1086,moment that we have left you know when
Woman101_Woman102_1087,we have these few weeks to actually
Woman101_Woman102_1088,habitate cohabitate together and you
Woman101_Woman102_1089,know spend real real real time together
Woman101_Woman102_1090,so
Woman101_Woman102_1091,yeah cool your turn no ask me the
Woman101_Woman102_1092,question you really want to ask what
Woman101_Woman102_1093,question do I really want to ask you
Woman101_Woman102_1094,what are we having for dinner later
Woman101_Woman102_1095,can we can we just sit on the couch oh
Woman101_Woman102_1096,no no I don't know I think we I think we
Woman101_Woman102_1097,communicate well and III don't I feel
Woman101_Woman102_1098,like we you know through this session
Woman101_Woman102_1099,there's a few things that I probably
Woman101_Woman102_1100,would have asked that I already got
Woman101_Woman102_1101,asked and there's not any secrets oh
Woman101_Woman102_1102,wait oh here I know when you just say
Woman101_Woman102_1103,goodbye to me in the morning when you
Woman101_Woman102_1104,walk out do you know I'm awake because
Woman101_Woman102_1105,you can't hear me snoring yep I knew it
Woman101_Woman102_1106,I knew you were awake because first of
Woman101_Woman102_1107,all you were I didn't I was like bitch
Woman101_Woman102_1108,always knows when I'm you have a gap in
Woman101_Woman102_1109,your between the door I know that begs
Woman101_Woman102_1110,and I know bullshit I wake up and if I
Woman101_Woman102_1111,hear you snoring I don't go there and I
Woman101_Woman102_1112,try really really hard to be quiet I
Woman101_Woman102_1113,knew it all right what do you think I
Woman101_Woman102_1114,want from life I don't know if I know
Woman101_Woman102_1115,the answer to that question I think that
Woman101_Woman102_1116,you tell me that you want to be a mom
Woman101_Woman102_1117,and you want to have you want to be a
Woman101_Woman102_1118,grandma you've been saying that lately
Woman101_Woman102_1119,you can't wait to be this like amazing
Woman101_Woman102_1120,grandma exactly exactly
Woman101_Woman102_1121,but I don't know if you do want that
Woman101_Woman102_1122,actually I I want you to to definitely
Woman101_Woman102_1123,have it if you want it but sometimes I
Woman101_Woman102_1124,wonder if that's really what you do want
Woman101_Woman102_1125,impracticality yeah I don't know it's a
Woman101_Woman102_1126,whole lot of baby action and stuff and
Woman101_Woman102_1127,responsibility I'm not sure either down
Woman101_Woman102_1128,to two questions your turn
Woman101_Woman102_1129,oh okay who do you think why do you
Woman101_Woman102_1130,think I am your best friend why so when
Woman101_Woman102_1131,you and I met we were so similar yeah
Woman101_Woman102_1132,not to say we're dissimilar now we are I
Woman101_Woman102_1133,think we have just gotten more familiar
Woman101_Woman102_1134,with our difference isn't when you meet
Woman101_Woman102_1135,somebody for sure in the first couple of
Woman101_Woman102_1136,years of friendship you take a lot of
Woman101_Woman102_1137,things that face out you don't go deeper
Woman101_Woman102_1138,because your party friends or because
Woman101_Woman102_1139,you're which I always think we were more
Woman101_Woman102_1140,than party front and straight out the
Woman101_Woman102_1141,gate but we didn't live in the same city
Woman101_Woman102_1142,or country even in a first night so it
Woman101_Woman102_1143,was easy to just be like we're so
Woman101_Woman102_1144,similar over the years you get to know
Woman101_Woman102_1145,one one another and you become more and
Woman101_Woman102_1146,more familiar with what is and isn't
Woman101_Woman102_1147,similar and what's different and what
Woman101_Woman102_1148,makes you connected so why do I think
Woman101_Woman102_1149,you're my best friend I mean you're like
Woman101_Woman102_1150,family to me yeah you know we say I love
Woman101_Woman102_1151,you in the morning or at night before we
Woman101_Woman102_1152,go to sleep you're the first person I
Woman101_Woman102_1153,text is the second person I texted
Woman101_Woman102_1154,usually text my mom when I land on a
Woman101_Woman102_1155,flight and vice versa you know you're
Woman101_Woman102_1156,totes my emergency contact I think you
Woman101_Woman102_1157,might even be on my passport but it's
Woman101_Woman102_1158,like I think that what makes our
Woman101_Woman102_1159,friendship so unique is that we've been
Woman101_Woman102_1160,through amazing things together we've
Woman101_Woman102_1161,been had so many highs but we've also
Woman101_Woman102_1162,had a lot of lows we and they're not
Woman101_Woman102_1163,lows that we've created that we've have
Woman101_Woman102_1164,had a few that we can literally count on
Woman101_Woman102_1165,one hand we've had some argument since
Woman101_Woman102_1166,now it should that's happened but it was
Woman101_Woman102_1167,always stupid shit we always knew we
Woman101_Woman102_1168,would get paralyzed you know you know
Woman101_Woman102_1169,it's not like one of us was cheating
Woman101_Woman102_1170,with somebody's boyfriend it's not like
Woman101_Woman102_1171,one of us is lying and messing up each
Woman101_Woman102_1172,other's lives
Woman101_Woman102_1173,it doesn't even enter into our our field
Woman101_Woman102_1174,of awareness it doesn't
Woman101_Woman102_1175,happen and it won't happen and that's a
Woman101_Woman102_1176,beautiful thing and I think that at some
Woman101_Woman102_1177,point during our friendship we realized
Woman101_Woman102_1178,that we were going to work hard at this
Woman101_Woman102_1179,and cultivate this friendship and build
Woman101_Woman102_1180,it and grow it and never let go of it
Woman101_Woman102_1181,and I think that that is what makes it
Woman101_Woman102_1182,so unique because I think in our lives
Woman101_Woman102_1183,because you and I have moved around so
Woman101_Woman102_1184,much
Woman101_Woman102_1185,we're nomadic we've seen a lot of
Woman101_Woman102_1186,friendships come and go and it's the
Woman101_Woman102_1187,ones that you really hold on to and
Woman101_Woman102_1188,cultivate more card at that are really
Woman101_Woman102_1189,special and that's what makes our
Woman101_Woman102_1190,friendship special yeah that's true okay
Woman101_Woman102_1191,I do so much like you said like a family
Woman101_Woman102_1192,member I do I I think and I think I
Woman101_Woman102_1193,think it's very clear that our families
Woman101_Woman102_1194,appreciate our friendship
Woman101_Woman102_1195,because they're from smaller towns and
Woman101_Woman102_1196,they don't always know exactly you know
Woman101_Woman102_1197,what we're doing with our lives and I
Woman101_Woman102_1198,think it stresses our moms out and I
Woman101_Woman102_1199,think to have been there for each other
Woman101_Woman102_1200,and to care for each other in a way
Woman101_Woman102_1201,that's a surrogate relationship to a
Woman101_Woman102_1202,family member has meant a lot - I mean
Woman101_Woman102_1203,it's meant a lot to me obviously
Woman101_Woman102_1204,personally but also you can see it
Woman101_Woman102_1205,reflected and the people who love us and
Woman101_Woman102_1206,care about us
Woman101_Woman102_1207,so yeah of course I love you I love you
Woman101_Woman102_1208,too Regan and yang it
