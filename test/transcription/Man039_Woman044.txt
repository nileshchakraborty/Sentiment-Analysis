Man039_Woman044_0001,when you when you think of the first
Man039_Woman044_0002,time we met what do you remember I
Man039_Woman044_0003,remember walking into the production
Man039_Woman044_0004,office and you spun around in your chair
Man039_Woman044_0005,and you were like who are you and I was
Man039_Woman044_0006,like who are you and then that's pretty
Man039_Woman044_0007,much I said who are you and what are you
Man039_Woman044_0008,about who are you and what do you do I
Man039_Woman044_0009,didn't answer the question do you what
Man039_Woman044_0010,do you love about our relationship
Man039_Woman044_0011,specifically the mornings are my
Man039_Woman044_0012,favorite waking up isn't my favorite
Man039_Woman044_0013,time of the day but the the union that
Man039_Woman044_0014,we like created the little pact that we
Man039_Woman044_0015,have with each other that we go away but
Man039_Woman044_0016,we come right home to each other and
Man039_Woman044_0017,it's our objective to like come together
Man039_Woman044_0018,what's it for you
Man039_Woman044_0019,I guess the favorite thing about my our
Man039_Woman044_0020,relationship my favorite thing about our
Man039_Woman044_0021,relationship is that kind of security
Man039_Woman044_0022,like feeling like I don't really want to
Man039_Woman044_0023,be anywhere else so I guess a sense of
Man039_Woman044_0024,calmness that I've gotten from being
Man039_Woman044_0025,with you to be how do you describe me to
Man039_Woman044_0026,others I always preface it by saying how
Man039_Woman044_0027,much I love you and how talented you are
Man039_Woman044_0028,and how much make me laugh and that you
Man039_Woman044_0029,are a clean freak and they help me
Man039_Woman044_0030,become a better person I mean there's
Man039_Woman044_0031,more to it but that's the the gist of my
Man039_Woman044_0032,intro but those clean freak is something
Man039_Woman044_0033,I think is is positive and and I think
Man039_Woman044_0034,it says a lot about the other areas in
Man039_Woman044_0035,your life and why you get so much
Man039_Woman044_0036,accomplished what are you hesitant to
Man039_Woman044_0037,tell me what are you hesitant to tell me
Man039_Woman044_0038,not much I'm pretty open with you maybe
Man039_Woman044_0039,even too open like a drapes it might
Man039_Woman044_0040,drive you crazy sometimes
Man039_Woman044_0041,but I think probably like stuff well
Man039_Woman044_0042,things that I do bring up which is just
Man039_Woman044_0043,like calling you out and stuff so I'm
Man039_Woman044_0044,always being careful how to approach
Man039_Woman044_0045,that but I'm pretty open with you why
Man039_Woman044_0046,are you hesitant to call me out because
Man039_Woman044_0047,of maybe how you might take it or your
Man039_Woman044_0048,your reaction to it but but I don't like
Man039_Woman044_0049,hold it back I still call it out and
Man039_Woman044_0050,then we deal with it it's probably like
Man039_Woman044_0051,one of my favorite things that we work
Man039_Woman044_0052,through things not we don't just like
Man039_Woman044_0053,keep it in our minds right what's the
Man039_Woman044_0054,sexual fantasy you're afraid to ask me
Man039_Woman044_0055,nothing I don't have one either like I'm
Man039_Woman044_0056,pretty it's straightforward and honest
Man039_Woman044_0057,right yeah complaints there that's great
Man039_Woman044_0058,who has more power in the relationship
Man039_Woman044_0059,you or me that's probably like it that's
Man039_Woman044_0060,probably something we're going through
Man039_Woman044_0061,right wait did I just ask the previous
Man039_Woman044_0062,question what I just asked the previous
Man039_Woman044_0063,question I did a double on tomorrow or
Man039_Woman044_0064,you went back in there yeah no way
Man039_Woman044_0065,no like go ahead it's cool
Man039_Woman044_0066,all right who has more power in the
Man039_Woman044_0067,relationship you or me I don't I think
Man039_Woman044_0068,we we haven't figured that out we both
Man039_Woman044_0069,are hard-headed we go through we go back
Man039_Woman044_0070,and forth on it where I'm like who's
Man039_Woman044_0071,gonna need this
Man039_Woman044_0072,Savannah was a good place that's where
Man039_Woman044_0073,we got to like realize like who's the
Man039_Woman044_0074,leader here and who's like not the
Man039_Woman044_0075,leader baby yeah right I think we just
Man039_Woman044_0076,realized we each had to give each other
Man039_Woman044_0077,our time to shine yeah and then me not
Man039_Woman044_0078,try to come in as like a work it boss
Man039_Woman044_0079,production manager who sacrifices more
Man039_Woman044_0080,in the relationship and how to how do
Man039_Woman044_0081,you feel about that I think we both
Man039_Woman044_0082,sacrificed equal amounts of yeah yeah I
Man039_Woman044_0083,guess we both sacrifice things for the
Man039_Woman044_0084,sake of the relationship what do we
Man039_Woman044_0085,sacrifice I don't even know I don't know
Man039_Woman044_0086,maybe
Man039_Woman044_0087,well I don't know cuz the things I feel
Man039_Woman044_0088,like I sacrificed
Man039_Woman044_0089,I don't really sacrificed and why like
Man039_Woman044_0090,for example like if I want to get
Man039_Woman044_0091,something that's organic food you're
Man039_Woman044_0092,like no let's not do that custom more
Man039_Woman044_0093,expensive and then I'm like you know and
Man039_Woman044_0094,then I realize like it's probably better
Man039_Woman044_0095,to be more conscious of money anyway so
Man039_Woman044_0096,like it's not really a sacrifice it's
Man039_Woman044_0097,just like a compromise an understood
Man039_Woman044_0098,compromise I guess but I don't feel like
Man039_Woman044_0099,there's anything I'm not doing I don't
Man039_Woman044_0100,feel that we have any big sacrifices
Man039_Woman044_0101,that we're making for each other yeah
Man039_Woman044_0102,not yet at least in our life well I
Man039_Woman044_0103,think we both agreed that if we were to
Man039_Woman044_0104,start making sacrifices that we would
Man039_Woman044_0105,start to resent each other so maybe
Man039_Woman044_0106,that's why we avoid looking at things
Man039_Woman044_0107,that way sure right but maybe maybe if
Man039_Woman044_0108,you start having kids sacrifice and
Man039_Woman044_0109,they'll just like start presenting
Man039_Woman044_0110,themselves to both it was enough oh shit
Man039_Woman044_0111,like now we got my turn here too I
Man039_Woman044_0112,already read that one oh yeah so it's my
Man039_Woman044_0113,turn here if your biggest secret was a
Man039_Woman044_0114,film what would the title be
Man039_Woman044_0115,damnit I think it's got to be a good
Man039_Woman044_0116,title
Man039_Woman044_0117,go to the Lost years
Man039_Woman044_0118,Julio Garcia where's yours mine for you

Man039_Woman044_0121,gonna make it you know forget it funnier
Man039_Woman044_0122,in my mind for my movie what do you
Man039_Woman044_0123,think it would be for me the strip bar
Man039_Woman044_0124,dear oh yeah I did work at a strip club
Man039_Woman044_0125,but I think everyone knows that I was no
Man039_Woman044_0126,secret yeah it was not a stripper
Man039_Woman044_0127,waitress who loves more in the
Man039_Woman044_0128,relationship who loves more yeah who
Man039_Woman044_0129,loves who more in the relationship I'm
Man039_Woman044_0130,like at max capacity love for you yeah
Man039_Woman044_0131,I think we're we know where we are I
Man039_Woman044_0132,think we love each other we work we're
Man039_Woman044_0133,walking this together we talk about it
Man039_Woman044_0134,on time you know we're doing this like
Man039_Woman044_0135,that's that I'm good yeah it's good baby
Man039_Woman044_0136,carry surprise what would you do if I
Man039_Woman044_0137,cheated on you what would you do if I
Man039_Woman044_0138,cheated on you
Man039_Woman044_0139,alright destroy me destroy me it would
Man039_Woman044_0140,break my heart but you know that they
Man039_Woman044_0141,still hurt what would you do I don't
Man039_Woman044_0142,know I'd fall apart I'd fall apart it
Man039_Woman044_0143,would kill me oh they are the strength
Man039_Woman044_0144,to die candle ad we like fuck this I'd
Man039_Woman044_0145,probably get over it but I would be
Man039_Woman044_0146,fucking damaged goods you you see where
Man039_Woman044_0147,I come from so I was damaged goods you
Man039_Woman044_0148,brought me back and I could imagine like
Man039_Woman044_0149,you just brought me back and write this
Man039_Woman044_0150,shit fucking falls apart I'd be like
Man039_Woman044_0151,fuck this fucking but you want to fuck
Man039_Woman044_0152,the world like problems II know worried
Man039_Woman044_0153,about you how do you feel
Man039_Woman044_0154,I would probably go to a really dark
Man039_Woman044_0155,place and like wanna cause harm to you
Man039_Woman044_0156,and whoever that person was until they
Man039_Woman044_0157,do it the Canary Islands or something I
Man039_Woman044_0158,wouldn't I wouldn't do it because I
Man039_Woman044_0159,don't want it to we've talked about this
Man039_Woman044_0160,I don't want that feeling for you to
Man039_Woman044_0161,have to experience that feeling and I
Man039_Woman044_0162,don't want it in my in my world either
Man039_Woman044_0163,so I think we're conscious of that
Man039_Woman044_0164,because it's just such an ugly thing
Man039_Woman044_0165,what's a compromise you've made that I
Man039_Woman044_0166,failed to recognize
Man039_Woman044_0167,I don't know I think I've like been
Man039_Woman044_0168,pretty communicative about whatever
Man039_Woman044_0169,frustrations I've had but all the
Man039_Woman044_0170,lifestyle changes I've made I don't look
Man039_Woman044_0171,at them I guess I don't really look at
Man039_Woman044_0172,them as compromises like I'm not doing
Man039_Woman044_0173,something I want to do I just look at
Man039_Woman044_0174,them as like an evolution of myself
Man039_Woman044_0175,neither maturing or getting better or
Man039_Woman044_0176,becoming more conscious of things but I
Man039_Woman044_0177,think if I got to the point where I was
Man039_Woman044_0178,like blaming you or the relationship for
Man039_Woman044_0179,these changes then I probably have to
Man039_Woman044_0180,reevaluate my priorities mm-hmm what's
Man039_Woman044_0181,the hardest thing about our relationship
Man039_Woman044_0182,be honest um I started with anything
Man039_Woman044_0183,right I don't say like it's not the
Man039_Woman044_0184,communication like we we talk to each
Man039_Woman044_0185,other we communicate like it's not
Man039_Woman044_0186,communication but something I guess it
Man039_Woman044_0187,always comes up for us and it might have
Man039_Woman044_0188,been in a couple of cautions I may be
Man039_Woman044_0189,like who's in control of the
Man039_Woman044_0190,relationship or or making making choices
Man039_Woman044_0191,or assumptions of like oh I figured this
Man039_Woman044_0192,would be good for us you know I think
Man039_Woman044_0193,that comes I think I think that comes
Man039_Woman044_0194,out a lot right yeah like you're talking
Man039_Woman044_0195,about the incident with the landlord
Man039_Woman044_0196,sure that's a good example there where
Man039_Woman044_0197,like one of us is thinking we're being
Man039_Woman044_0198,helpful but then the other person thinks
Man039_Woman044_0199,that we're yeah like dominating
Man039_Woman044_0200,your executive decisions yeah but isn't
Man039_Woman044_0201,carrier because I feel like it existed
Man039_Woman044_0202,existed and then we talked about it I
Man039_Woman044_0203,was like hey like we got to do this shit
Man039_Woman044_0204,together like we can't you I can't just
Man039_Woman044_0205,be making decisions on my own and like
Man039_Woman044_0206,expect you to like let it happen right
Man039_Woman044_0207,or like you well yeah and you said that
Man039_Woman044_0208,you came from a other relationship where
Man039_Woman044_0209,you did everything and that person
Man039_Woman044_0210,didn't so maybe you were used to it and
Man039_Woman044_0211,I come from a relationship previous
Man039_Woman044_0212,relationship where I was doing
Man039_Woman044_0213,everything and the other person was like
Man039_Woman044_0214,yeah cruising so so you think that's the
Man039_Woman044_0215,hardest thing about our relationship no
Man039_Woman044_0216,no I think that's a challenge I don't
Man039_Woman044_0217,know if it's the hardest thing about a
Man039_Woman044_0218,relationship I feel I don't know about
Man039_Woman044_0219,I have something hard in this
Man039_Woman044_0220,relationship because I feel really
Man039_Woman044_0221,comfortable in it what do you feel is
Man039_Woman044_0222,the harness
Man039_Woman044_0223,I'm turning like not associated with
Man039_Woman044_0224,like what's the hardest thing about for
Man039_Woman044_0225,it to deal with the with you in the
Man039_Woman044_0226,reddish you know it's just like what's
Man039_Woman044_0227,it you know and in the relationship
Man039_Woman044_0228,itself not necessarily like hard to deal
Man039_Woman044_0229,with about you or you deal with me Oh
Man039_Woman044_0230,like what's the hardest thing to deal
Man039_Woman044_0231,with yeah I think that's kind of already
Man039_Woman044_0232,[Music]
Man039_Woman044_0233,okay I may be the hardest thing in our
Man039_Woman044_0234,actual relationship that's like about
Man039_Woman044_0235,both of us is that we take on a lot of
Man039_Woman044_0236,projects and we hit a lot of ideas and
Man039_Woman044_0237,then we both like stress about it and
Man039_Woman044_0238,become overwhelmed and like can't live
Man039_Woman044_0239,in the present moment and that gets yeah
Man039_Woman044_0240,that's pretty annoying yeah that drives
Man039_Woman044_0241,both of us crazy yeah but we've got a
Man039_Woman044_0242,little bit of a hold on it I think yeah
Man039_Woman044_0243,but I I think that that's hard is like
Man039_Woman044_0244,we are just impatient and we do a lot of
Man039_Woman044_0245,things and
Man039_Woman044_0246,get overwhelmed you can change one thing
Man039_Woman044_0247,about me what would it be for you to put
Man039_Woman044_0248,the toilet seat down
Man039_Woman044_0249,whatever I don't know I guess like the
Man039_Woman044_0250,only thing could I ever feel like we
Man039_Woman044_0251,absolutely like have already agreed to
Man039_Woman044_0252,disagree on but I feel like we could
Man039_Woman044_0253,still get to a better place what that is
Man039_Woman044_0254,probably about like you know it's not
Man039_Woman044_0255,like important but it doesn't change
Man039_Woman044_0256,anything really but I just feel like I
Man039_Woman044_0257,have these really strong values about
Man039_Woman044_0258,like like moral values about food and I
Man039_Woman044_0259,wish weak you know I wish that you could
Man039_Woman044_0260,like sit there and like bitch with me
Man039_Woman044_0261,about like genetically modified food and
Man039_Woman044_0262,like and just you know just like but
Man039_Woman044_0263,it's not but it's not necessarily
Man039_Woman044_0264,anything that affects our relationship
Man039_Woman044_0265,but I would like to be able to like open
Man039_Woman044_0266,up about that more with you because it's
Man039_Woman044_0267,like a topic that's important to me sure
Man039_Woman044_0268,and they're liking on my views on it
Man039_Woman044_0269,that's just that fair
Man039_Woman044_0270,everything's our marketing campaign to
Man039_Woman044_0271,like get me to spend more money so it's
Man039_Woman044_0272,just like I do not trust right but for
Man039_Woman044_0273,it for me it would be a little bit more
Man039_Woman044_0274,I think I tell you a lot where I think
Man039_Woman044_0275,you probably or I think you've shown
Man039_Woman044_0276,like a you a lot of times you struggle
Man039_Woman044_0277,with just like showing me like that
Man039_Woman044_0278,there's weakness and I'm like and I'm
Man039_Woman044_0279,always saying to him like it's okay it's
Man039_Woman044_0280,okay if like
Man039_Woman044_0281,we fall like I want to be able to like
Man039_Woman044_0282,that if you're uncomfortable I want to
Man039_Woman044_0283,be able to know that I could like bring
Man039_Woman044_0284,you up and like that you're okay you
Man039_Woman044_0285,know so maybe for me it's not like a
Man039_Woman044_0286,little bit of a struggle of I don't even
Man039_Woman044_0287,if I'm answering a question anymore but
Man039_Woman044_0288,[Music]
Man039_Woman044_0289,maybe that you of getting you to to
Man039_Woman044_0290,sometimes be okay with not having the
Man039_Woman044_0291,answer and allowing that somebody else
Man039_Woman044_0292,might be like oh they're gonna solve
Man039_Woman044_0293,this why do you love me because because
Man039_Woman044_0294,of the way that I feel when I'm with a
Man039_Woman044_0295,when I'm with you like in the mornings
Man039_Woman044_0296,when I wake up and I just look at you
Man039_Woman044_0297,and I'm like man and she just goes there
Man039_Woman044_0298,and like and I could feel that you want
Man039_Woman044_0299,to be there with me and like you are
Man039_Woman044_0300,gonna be there with me so you have to
Man039_Woman044_0301,seem like the worst in me and you're
Man039_Woman044_0302,like oh man I'm gonna stick around what
Man039_Woman044_0303,about you
Man039_Woman044_0304,I guess it's like that same feeling that
Man039_Woman044_0305,I'm talking about before where like I
Man039_Woman044_0306,don't feel like there's anywhere else
Man039_Woman044_0307,that I have to be besides with you and
Man039_Woman044_0308,that is a a new and unique feeling from
Man039_Woman044_0309,you so that's just how I know that
