Man062_Woman067_0045,your dad got mad at us because he didn't
Man062_Woman067_0046,understand why but that's one of my
Man062_Woman067_0047,that's something I always remember when

Man062_Woman067_0049,when we were going through the whole
Man062_Woman067_0050,labor experience and delivering
Man062_Woman067_0051,Charlotte and I thought I loved you
Man062_Woman067_0052,before and then when she was born

Man062_Woman067_0062,a worrywart and I think what makes me

Man062_Woman067_0065,I've done some stuff that you know I
Man062_Woman067_0066,might regret and stuff that's kind of
Man062_Woman067_0067,made you think that we were coming to an
Man062_Woman067_0068,end
Man062_Woman067_0069,as a couple and when it came to that
Man062_Woman067_0070,that always made me worry about you

Man062_Woman067_0122,you know what's bothering you and then
Man062_Woman067_0123,having been buried and then brought up
Man062_Woman067_0124,five years ten years from now and then

Man062_Woman067_0132,sometimes I'm a very thick skull
Man062_Woman067_0133,so do appreciate the fact that you
Man062_Woman067_0134,followed me down here even though we had
Man062_Woman067_0135,a year without each other that was
Man062_Woman067_0136,definitely hard for you and I thank God
Man062_Woman067_0137,for cell phones do you think that we're
Man062_Woman067_0138,still a good match why or why not like

Man062_Woman067_0140,through times where we've been we've had
Man062_Woman067_0141,our ups and downs and we've we've dated
Man062_Woman067_0142,different versions of us throughout the
Man062_Woman067_0143,10 years and there's been points where I
Man062_Woman067_0144,thought we weren't good matches for each
Man062_Woman067_0145,other yeah and I thought most of the
Man062_Woman067_0146,time we have been a great match but
Man062_Woman067_0147,there's been times where it was hard
Man062_Woman067_0148,because it's hard to say but sometimes
Man062_Woman067_0149,he ended up second-guessing us we both
Man062_Woman067_0150,had enough second guessing us because we
Man062_Woman067_0151,weren't I wasn't doing the right thing
Man062_Woman067_0152,where I wasn't where does two separate
Man062_Woman067_0153,people sometimes yeah we went through
Man062_Woman067_0154,like different phases of our lives at
Man062_Woman067_0155,different times no even though we were
Man062_Woman067_0156,still together like I did my partying

Man062_Woman067_0158,partying last year that's not funny but
Man062_Woman067_0159,yeah I did I think that's why it's
Man062_Woman067_0160,worked out because we balance each other
Man062_Woman067_0161,sometimes you're the stronger person
Man062_Woman067_0162,it's gonna be done the stronger person
Man062_Woman067_0163,sometimes I hold it together sometimes
Man062_Woman067_0164,you hold it together

Man062_Woman067_0170,core for our house knickknacks that we
Man062_Woman067_0171,don't need and you like to spend it on
Man062_Woman067_0172,going out to eat or going out and having
Man062_Woman067_0173,drinks or or I think it's silly I'd
Man062_Woman067_0174,rather stay home and just buy clothes I

Man062_Woman067_0187,didn't know about me before how much you
Man062_Woman067_0188,can love someone else but me I've seen

Man062_Woman067_0190,your grandparents very affectionate
Man062_Woman067_0191,towards your mom and dad but for
Man062_Woman067_0192,something you and I created I can see

Man062_Woman067_0199,this to come home and see you too
Man062_Woman067_0200,and it's hard being down here sometimes
Man062_Woman067_0201,because I thought it was going to be
Man062_Woman067_0202,picture-perfect and unfortunately it's
Man062_Woman067_0203,not I've gone through a lot of stuff
Man062_Woman067_0204,that have been ill choices bad choices
Man062_Woman067_0205,and just it's not worked out in my favor
Man062_Woman067_0206,and coming home and seeing that it
Man062_Woman067_0207,really it keeps me from not losing it
Man062_Woman067_0208,what's the greatest lesson I've taught
Man062_Woman067_0209,you I don't know if you were answering
Man062_Woman067_0210,that question for me you would say a lot
Man062_Woman067_0211,goodness there's so many I can't really
Man062_Woman067_0212,think of anything what to window where
Man062_Woman067_0213,the appropriate clothes sometimes I
Man062_Woman067_0214,don't you've definitely helped me out
Man062_Woman067_0215,with my fashion sense maybe it's a dumb
Man062_Woman067_0216,answer but it's the first thing that's
Man062_Woman067_0217,coming to my head because I can't I
Man062_Woman067_0218,guess you you help me out with that I
Man062_Woman067_0219,would be lost and what I wear thank you
Man062_Woman067_0220,thank you
Man062_Woman067_0221,what is the biggest compromise your
Man062_Woman067_0222,you've made and would change it was it
Man062_Woman067_0223,was it worth it
Man062_Woman067_0224,why or not yeah I was harder yeah what
Man062_Woman067_0225,was the biggest compromise you've made
Man062_Woman067_0226,would you change it was it worth it
Man062_Woman067_0227,why or why not the biggest compromise
Man062_Woman067_0228,I've made is moving down here would you
Man062_Woman067_0229,change no I wouldn't want I think it's
Man062_Woman067_0230,something that and I when I went to
Man062_Woman067_0231,college I went to college at home I
Man062_Woman067_0232,didn't go away to college so it's like I
Man062_Woman067_0233,never really got to experience living
Man062_Woman067_0234,somewhere else and like you said like
Man062_Woman067_0235,I'm very close with my family and we're
Man062_Woman067_0236,very close to our friends and
Man062_Woman067_0237,familiarity and stuff that were
Man062_Woman067_0238,comfortable with but it was nice to get
Man062_Woman067_0239,out of my comfort zone and I think we
Man062_Woman067_0240,learned a lot about each other then more
Man062_Woman067_0241,so than we did in the first eight years
Man062_Woman067_0242,we were together or that we knew each
Man062_Woman067_0243,other not together but I learned more
Man062_Woman067_0244,about you in the last four years we've
Man062_Woman067_0245,been down here because we were able we
Man062_Woman067_0246,had to rely on each other more rather
Man062_Woman067_0247,than then friends and family and people
Man062_Woman067_0248,that were in our lives that we cared
Man062_Woman067_0249,about it was it's just different but I
Man062_Woman067_0250,wouldn't change it I like that we were
Man062_Woman067_0251,able to move down here it's an
Man062_Woman067_0252,experience just not sure if I see myself
Man062_Woman067_0253,living here forever
Man062_Woman067_0254,do you believe in the one like a fool me
Man062_Woman067_0255,and what me what makes you believe I'm
Man062_Woman067_0256,the one so yes I do believe in soulmates
Man062_Woman067_0257,I think we talked about this when we
Man062_Woman067_0258,were 17 archers maybe 16 I don't know
Man062_Woman067_0259,the years kind of we've kind of blurred
Man062_Woman067_0260,in together but uh great years we were
Man062_Woman067_0261,talking about how when we held each
Man062_Woman067_0262,other's hands it fit perfectly when we
Man062_Woman067_0263,kissed each other our lips felt perfect
Man062_Woman067_0264,yeah we've had spats yeah we've had our
Man062_Woman067_0265,little disagreements and whatnot but I I
Man062_Woman067_0266,know you're my soul mate I know I can
Man062_Woman067_0267,see I see other people and I see other
Man062_Woman067_0268,women and like their relationships and
Man062_Woman067_0269,whatnot and men's relationships with
Man062_Woman067_0270,other their significant others and and I
Man062_Woman067_0271,I just I can't see myself with anyone
Man062_Woman067_0272,else any think that's something that we
Man062_Woman067_0273,talked about before to where it's like
Man062_Woman067_0274,throughout the course of our
Man062_Woman067_0275,relationship right when we were about to
Man062_Woman067_0276,break things off or when we did break
Man062_Woman067_0277,things off for a while
Man062_Woman067_0278,like it's weird how little things like
Man062_Woman067_0279,kind of brought us back together like we
Man062_Woman067_0280,broke up and then your grandma died you
Man062_Woman067_0281,know it was like just weird things that
Man062_Woman067_0282,and then we were going through a really
Man062_Woman067_0283,hard time and we had Charlotte you know
Man062_Woman067_0284,yeah and I feel like it brought us back
Man062_Woman067_0285,not not that like a baby solves all your
Man062_Woman067_0286,problems or a catastrophic event like a
Man062_Woman067_0287,death or something solves problems but I
Man062_Woman067_0288,think it brings brought us back to
Man062_Woman067_0289,reality and brought us back to
Man062_Woman067_0290,centralization of our relationship yeah
Man062_Woman067_0291,that's important I think you did too
Man062_Woman067_0292,because there definitely are
Man062_Woman067_0293,helped us out realize what's important
Man062_Woman067_0294,to you and I what's the greatest gift
Man062_Woman067_0295,you've received from battling drugs and
Man062_Woman067_0296,alcohol
Man062_Woman067_0297,the biggest gift I've received I would
Man062_Woman067_0298,say
Man062_Woman067_0299,just a realization knowing that you're
Man062_Woman067_0300,there I have sometimes throwing you down
Man062_Woman067_0301,to the wayside especially surrounding
Man062_Woman067_0302,myself with new friends down here versus

Man062_Woman067_0336,enough of that for the both of us so let
Man062_Woman067_0337,me choose a cartoon
Man062_Woman067_0338,how has battling your addiction affected
Man062_Woman067_0339,our relationship and I'm gonna change
Man062_Woman067_0340,that a little bit how is battling your
Man062_Woman067_0341,shopping addiction affected our
Man062_Woman067_0342,relationship it's hard sometimes it's I
Man062_Woman067_0343,know I spend money on stupid ridiculous
Man062_Woman067_0344,things aren't important and I think
Man062_Woman067_0345,about it and like these materialistic
Man062_Woman067_0346,things i buy and for some reason it
Man062_Woman067_0347,makes me feel better but then I think
Man062_Woman067_0348,like why because we're not gonna take
Man062_Woman067_0349,them with us when we're gone you know I
Man062_Woman067_0350,I think that having Charlotte has like
Man062_Woman067_0351,made me kind of transition from that I
Man062_Woman067_0352,haven't really no I'm buying her clothes
Man062_Woman067_0353,but no just because it's not important
Man062_Woman067_0354,anymore I realized what is important and
Man062_Woman067_0355,close and tangible things aren't as
Man062_Woman067_0356,important as they used to be serious
Man062_Woman067_0357,when I say this we can open up in
Man062_Woman067_0358,Nordstrom Rack from that closet that you
Man062_Woman067_0359,have it could be a whole cellar no yes
Man062_Woman067_0360,we could I know
Man062_Woman067_0361,oh no that's gonna be my turn again I
Man062_Woman067_0362,want to do two in a row
Man062_Woman067_0363,what would make you leave me if you
Man062_Woman067_0364,brought drugs around Charlotte and put
Man062_Woman067_0365,her in the environment that you used to
Man062_Woman067_0366,put yourself in or put her in any kind
Man062_Woman067_0367,of danger because I can I can handle
Man062_Woman067_0368,stuff but I would never want to put her
Man062_Woman067_0369,through anything no I'm not going to I
Man062_Woman067_0370,know
Man062_Woman067_0371,let it be known um how do you feel about
Man062_Woman067_0372,our second child second child I want to
Man062_Woman067_0373,you know I always make the joke it's the
Man062_Woman067_0374,Mexican in me and we need to start
Man062_Woman067_0375,popping them out as much as possible as
Man062_Woman067_0376,soon as possible we don't need a two
Man062_Woman067_0377,year break let's do it now I mean the
Man062_Woman067_0378,you know the business part of it it's
Man062_Woman067_0379,fine definitely fine no I'm excited I I
Man062_Woman067_0380,know you say we want a boy but I think
Man062_Woman067_0381,we're gonna have another girl again
Man062_Woman067_0382,sorry but no I'm excited
Man062_Woman067_0383,I really am it's next year or two years
Man062_Woman067_0384,from now or three
Man062_Woman067_0385,no two years can't wait that long you
Man062_Woman067_0386,want a big okay what do you think is the
Man062_Woman067_0387,most important lesson at this stage in
Man062_Woman067_0388,life right now my most important lesson
Man062_Woman067_0389,has been Charlotte I want to take care
Man062_Woman067_0390,of her I want to be the father figure
Man062_Woman067_0391,that I never had so it's interesting to
Man062_Woman067_0392,see how I've been reacting towards her
Man062_Woman067_0393,and how I treat her because I'm always
Man062_Woman067_0394,scared one day that scared one day that
Man062_Woman067_0395,I'm not going to be there
Man062_Woman067_0396,and I don't know know why I know I am
Man062_Woman067_0397,but I had this fear that like lingers
Man062_Woman067_0398,like in my my stomach I feel like I
Man062_Woman067_0399,won't be there and I'm scared to see
Man062_Woman067_0400,that because because I don't want to
Man062_Woman067_0401,miss anything I know how much it's
Man062_Woman067_0402,affected me not having my my dad around
Man062_Woman067_0403,or sometimes not even my mom around yeah
Man062_Woman067_0404,and I want to provide something that I
Man062_Woman067_0405,never had what is it that makes you
Man062_Woman067_0406,think you're not gonna be around I don't
Man062_Woman067_0407,know it's that it's that fear it's not
Man062_Woman067_0408,having that growing up so I
Man062_Woman067_0409,automatically think that that's what's
Man062_Woman067_0410,gonna be like for her it sounds stupid I
Man062_Woman067_0411,know it does but it just it's not stupid
Man062_Woman067_0412,I know but it's it terrifies me
Man062_Woman067_0413,what do you think is the hardest thing
Man062_Woman067_0414,for me right now I mean you've never
Man062_Woman067_0415,really struggled with up until like
Man062_Woman067_0416,recently is that you've you've always
Man062_Woman067_0417,felt you've always been really confident
Man062_Woman067_0418,from what I remember and then last like
Man062_Woman067_0419,a few years I feel like your
Man062_Woman067_0420,self-confidence has taken some pretty
Man062_Woman067_0421,big hits and it's not something that
Man062_Woman067_0422,should be taking hits but I think you're
Man062_Woman067_0423,battling with so many things from like
Man062_Woman067_0424,the diss distance from your family and
Man062_Woman067_0425,issues that you've never really wanted
Man062_Woman067_0426,to address with yourself because like
Man062_Woman067_0427,you said you try to like be strong so
Man062_Woman067_0428,because I'm the one that worries with me
Man062_Woman067_0429,being the one that worries you're the
Man062_Woman067_0430,one that tries to keep it together and
Man062_Woman067_0431,act like nothing's a big deal even
Man062_Woman067_0432,though I know it is and so I feel like
Man062_Woman067_0433,you're trying to bet you're trying to
Man062_Woman067_0434,take on so many battles within yourself
Man062_Woman067_0435,and not letting me help you and that's
Man062_Woman067_0436,why I feel like you did turn to drugs
Man062_Woman067_0437,because you didn't know how to deal with
Man062_Woman067_0438,all the things that you were dealing
Man062_Woman067_0439,with and you didn't know how to talk to
Man062_Woman067_0440,me about them I think your your
Man062_Woman067_0441,self-confidence is your biggest battle
Man062_Woman067_0442,right now yeah your self-worth has been
Man062_Woman067_0443,last couple of years it's definitely
Man062_Woman067_0444,change it's been not it's been hard so I
Man062_Woman067_0445,should know was Charlotte here yeah I
Man062_Woman067_0446,want to know I guess I don't one just
Man062_Woman067_0447,provide so
Man062_Woman067_0448,yeah are you worried our child may
Man062_Woman067_0449,battle with addictions like we did fuck
Man062_Woman067_0450,yeah oh let's say addiction is genetic
Man062_Woman067_0451,you know it's just I just passed out and
Man062_Woman067_0452,I deal with it every day yeah no I know
Man062_Woman067_0453,you've deal some stuff every day not as
Man062_Woman067_0454,much as me but I because yours is more
Man062_Woman067_0455,recent so it's just at the same time I
Man062_Woman067_0456,don't want to shelter her but at the
Man062_Woman067_0457,same time I want her to be aware of
Man062_Woman067_0458,what's going on in the world but I don't
Man062_Woman067_0459,want her to go through the same thing I
Man062_Woman067_0460,did what do you think would how can we
Man062_Woman067_0461,like prepare her to not face the same
Man062_Woman067_0462,struggles that we did just let her know
Man062_Woman067_0463,I don't know what I went through I don't
Man062_Woman067_0464,know what my mom my mom went through and
Man062_Woman067_0465,but our parents shared with us their
Man062_Woman067_0466,struggles she's a Fartman baby I think
Man062_Woman067_0467,with something like that I think just
Man062_Woman067_0468,everyday cuz I think the reason why I
Man062_Woman067_0469,turned to it myself was just I didn't of
Man062_Woman067_0470,course I had your love I had your
Man062_Woman067_0471,parents there but at the same time I
Man062_Woman067_0472,felt like I was lacking my real family
Man062_Woman067_0473,yeah and a lot of stuff and I buried
Man062_Woman067_0474,what doing drugs was that that feeling
Man062_Woman067_0475,there like I just kind of swallowed it
Man062_Woman067_0476,and kept it inside and so
Man062_Woman067_0477,I think just being there for knowing
Man062_Woman067_0478,that we love her let her know that we
Man062_Woman067_0479,love her and and also tell her tell her
Man062_Woman067_0480,what could happen
Man062_Woman067_0481,come on I can't read that right what can
Man062_Woman067_0482,I do what can I do to improve our
Man062_Woman067_0483,relationship I think sometimes you you
Man062_Woman067_0484,already think what I am going to say so
Man062_Woman067_0485,you you don't tell me things or you
Man062_Woman067_0486,withhold things for me because you're
Man062_Woman067_0487,like well I knew I knew what you were
Man062_Woman067_0488,going to say or I knew how you're going
Man062_Woman067_0489,to react and I think you're taking that
Man062_Woman067_0490,away from me you're taking I think that
Man062_Woman067_0491,you I'm a grown person you can tell me
Man062_Woman067_0492,things I think that part of it is just
Man062_Woman067_0493,like having a conversation rather than
Man062_Woman067_0494,we find out later or you know I think a
Man062_Woman067_0495,lot of it is just having a conversation
Man062_Woman067_0496,and being able to sit down and talk
Man062_Woman067_0497,openly and honestly with each other
Man062_Woman067_0498,rather than you thinking that you know
Man062_Woman067_0499,what I'm gonna say because you don't
Man062_Woman067_0500,always know what I'm gonna say or how
Man062_Woman067_0501,I'm gonna react you just think you do it
Man062_Woman067_0502,a lot of times it gets us in the
Man062_Woman067_0503,position that we're in when it's
Man062_Woman067_0504,difficult because we choose to not share
Man062_Woman067_0505,things with each other mm-hmm and so I
Man062_Woman067_0506,think that's the biggest thing right now
Man062_Woman067_0507,is that you you think you know how I'm
Man062_Woman067_0508,going to react let's say when you hang
Man062_Woman067_0509,out with the guys and if you were to do
Man062_Woman067_0510,drugs again it's not something that
Man062_Woman067_0511,would make me leave you or something
Man062_Woman067_0512,that I would hate you for you know that
Man062_Woman067_0513,we have Charlotte but it's just
Man062_Woman067_0514,something that I want you to be honest
Man062_Woman067_0515,with me I want you to be I want to be
Man062_Woman067_0516,able to tell me I want you to be able to
Man062_Woman067_0517,tell me and we so we can have a
Man062_Woman067_0518,conversation and move on from it it's
Man062_Woman067_0519,not something that should be dwelled on
Man062_Woman067_0520,but when you find things out other ways
Man062_Woman067_0521,rather than directly from you it makes
Man062_Woman067_0522,it like a harder blow
Man062_Woman067_0523,because I'd rather hear it from you if
Man062_Woman067_0524,like sometimes I am scared sighs I want
Man062_Woman067_0525,you to think that I'm I messed up again
Man062_Woman067_0526,or I did something wrong again and it
Man062_Woman067_0527,just terrifies me to make you think that
Man062_Woman067_0528,it's not that but you're gonna continue
Man062_Woman067_0529,to face whether it be drug addiction or
Man062_Woman067_0530,lying or whatever you're gonna face all
Man062_Woman067_0531,those battles until you deal with the
Man062_Woman067_0532,real issue which is the distance from
Man062_Woman067_0533,your family no you're right
Man062_Woman067_0534,and you always say no I don't care no I
Man062_Woman067_0535,don't care when they treat you the way
Man062_Woman067_0536,that they do but I know it bothers you
Man062_Woman067_0537,and I know you're just trying to have
Man062_Woman067_0538,like a hard exterior because again
Man062_Woman067_0539,you're trying to be strong for me
Man062_Woman067_0540,because I'm the one who's usually
Man062_Woman067_0541,worried about it but it's okay to not be
Man062_Woman067_0542,strong sometimes and it's okay to just
Man062_Woman067_0543,admit that you're vulnerable you know
Man062_Woman067_0544,it's hard for me to do that you know
Man062_Woman067_0545,sometimes I end up being a little
Man062_Woman067_0546,detached from starting people and I want
Man062_Woman067_0547,to be better at that I definitely do
Man062_Woman067_0548,something I am trying to work on but
Man062_Woman067_0549,it's just it's hard it's really hard for
Man062_Woman067_0550,me I know it is but that's one thing
Man062_Woman067_0551,I've always loved about you from the
Man062_Woman067_0552,time we first met and your family was
Man062_Woman067_0553,the way that they were is that no matter
Man062_Woman067_0554,how they treated you you had the biggest
Man062_Woman067_0555,heart
Man062_Woman067_0556,you constantly wanted to do nice things
Man062_Woman067_0557,for these people who rejected you who
Man062_Woman067_0558,are doing awful things to you but you
Man062_Woman067_0559,had such a big heart and we're so
Man062_Woman067_0560,generous and none of that mattered to
Man062_Woman067_0561,you that they were doing that to you you
Man062_Woman067_0562,still wanted to be there for them and
Man062_Woman067_0563,you still wanted to - you have you have
Man062_Woman067_0564,like a very kind heart your end
Man062_Woman067_0565,sometimes sometimes that's a
Man062_Woman067_0566,double-edged sword because sometimes
Man062_Woman067_0567,you're a little too generous with the
Man062_Woman067_0568,wrong people you're generous with people
Man062_Woman067_0569,who wouldn't do the same for you you
Man062_Woman067_0570,like too
Man062_Woman067_0571,not just give tangible things but you
Man062_Woman067_0572,also are you would do anything for the
Man062_Woman067_0573,people that you consider friends but a
Man062_Woman067_0574,question that we've always talked about
Man062_Woman067_0575,would they do it for you
Man062_Woman067_0576,the people that you're doing these
Man062_Woman067_0577,generous nice things for and then you're
Man062_Woman067_0578,opening your heart to whether it be
Man062_Woman067_0579,family or friends would they do it for
Man062_Woman067_0580,you
Man062_Woman067_0581,you're you're you need to like value
Man062_Woman067_0582,your own self-worth because you're
Man062_Woman067_0583,you're important and I feel like you
Man062_Woman067_0584,don't see that and you try to give to
Man062_Woman067_0585,others but no one is going to give it
Man062_Woman067_0586,back to you no one is giving it back to
Man062_Woman067_0587,you yeah I've kind of not been as kind
Man062_Woman067_0588,in the last couple of years I think
Man062_Woman067_0589,lways made you hard I guess so that's
Man062_Woman067_0590,why I've kind of closed myself off to
Man062_Woman067_0591,everyone else saying no I don't care
Man062_Woman067_0592,fuck them
Man062_Woman067_0593,that's why I've closed myself off to my
Man062_Woman067_0594,family I guess I had something I need to
Man062_Woman067_0595,work on I need to get back to where it
Man062_Woman067_0596,was it's hard Sark you're still there
Man062_Woman067_0597,you're still generous kind person and
Man062_Woman067_0598,you always have been you always will be
Man062_Woman067_0599,yeah but it's just like I said bean
Man062_Woman067_0600,dinners to the carrying to the right
Man062_Woman067_0601,people
Man062_Woman067_0602,mmm
Man062_Woman067_0603,do you ever wonder what it would be like
Man062_Woman067_0604,to be with someone else
Man062_Woman067_0605,oh we had never gotten together that's a
Man062_Woman067_0606,pretty deep question yeah well I would
Man062_Woman067_0607,be a liar if I didn't say that
Man062_Woman067_0608,that wasn't true yeah because it's
Man062_Woman067_0609,definitely coming here to LA it's it's
Man062_Woman067_0610,not the norm for someone being we were
Man062_Woman067_0611,23 years old when we got married and we
Man062_Woman067_0612,were together since her 15 we tell
Man062_Woman067_0613,people that and people are like why I
Man062_Woman067_0614,don't get it why why why have you guys
Man062_Woman067_0615,been together for such a long time I
Man062_Woman067_0616,don't I don't understand it and you're
Man062_Woman067_0617,married and do you guys have kids no not
Man062_Woman067_0618,yet well now we do
Man062_Woman067_0619,well now we do but this is like you know
Man062_Woman067_0620,yeah like two years ago and people
Man062_Woman067_0621,didn't understand it
Man062_Woman067_0622,but I have yeah
Man062_Woman067_0623,and it's but it's something that I know
Man062_Woman067_0624,it's not right for me something I don't
Man062_Woman067_0625,want I know that much yeah cuz you are
Man062_Woman067_0626,as important to me as Charlotte is yeah
Man062_Woman067_0627,I need you what about you like you said
Man062_Woman067_0628,like I would I would be lying if I said
Man062_Woman067_0629,no it's it's no it's a natural human
Man062_Woman067_0630,instinct I think to kind of but the
Man062_Woman067_0631,grass is always greener on the other
Man062_Woman067_0632,side you know I know that greener side
Man062_Woman067_0633,who is that name but I'm just saying
Man062_Woman067_0634,like like when for example when we were
Man062_Woman067_0635,in Portland and we've said oh be so
Man062_Woman067_0636,different in LA like at least me so
Man062_Woman067_0637,great and then we're in LA it's like oh
Man062_Woman067_0638,Portland's so great something in a
Man062_Woman067_0639,relationship you look at other people's
Man062_Woman067_0640,relationships whether it be like on
Man062_Woman067_0641,social media or just walking down the
Man062_Woman067_0642,street and there's always new things
Man062_Woman067_0643,that you idolize about other people's
Man062_Woman067_0644,relationships and then there's things
Man062_Woman067_0645,where I think about like what if we
Man062_Woman067_0646,would have never gotten together and how
Man062_Woman067_0647,different like
Man062_Woman067_0648,Highschool would have been how different
Man062_Woman067_0649,college would have been would I be
Man062_Woman067_0650,living in LA no you know what I mean
Man062_Woman067_0651,mm-hmm I think I would have always just
Man062_Woman067_0652,stayed there and that's not good yeah
Man062_Woman067_0653,yeah I think it's normal to attempt to
Man062_Woman067_0654,see yourself in other people and what
Man062_Woman067_0655,it'll be like I still want to know named
Man062_Woman067_0656,who what is the secret you have been
Man062_Woman067_0657,afraid to tell me
Man062_Woman067_0658,okay I never wanted to tell you this but
Man062_Woman067_0659,the reason why Josue doesn't talk to us
Man062_Woman067_0660,anymore is because that night that we
Man062_Woman067_0661,were all out in Santa Monica he told me
Man062_Woman067_0662,that he loved me and I think that it was
Man062_Woman067_0663,something he was he was drunk but I
Man062_Woman067_0664,think that he was embarrassed afterward
Man062_Woman067_0665,and I had told him like hey like we all
Man062_Woman067_0666,say stupid stuff when we're drunk don't
Man062_Woman067_0667,worry about it and he never wrote me
Man062_Woman067_0668,back and I tried to play it off because
Man062_Woman067_0669,I've said some stupid stuff when I'm
Man062_Woman067_0670,drunk to remember that one time when I
Man062_Woman067_0671,was like so I don't know and so I think
Man062_Woman067_0672,that he feels really awkward now and now
Man062_Woman067_0673,too much time has gone by but I've
Man062_Woman067_0674,always been scared to tell you that
Man062_Woman067_0675,because I didn't want you to react that
Man062_Woman067_0676,he really did that's news to me yeah
Man062_Woman067_0677,yeah I was I don't for the next one if
Man062_Woman067_0678,you could wish one thing for me and it
Man062_Woman067_0679,would be what would it be sorry
Man062_Woman067_0680,and why
Man062_Woman067_0681,I could wish I would wish that you could
Man062_Woman067_0682,feel established in your own career and
Man062_Woman067_0683,that you would feel confident in that I
Man062_Woman067_0684,wish that you could find your own
Man062_Woman067_0685,happiness within yourself and within the
Man062_Woman067_0686,people that love and care about you
Man062_Woman067_0687,nothing and something that you've
Man062_Woman067_0688,struggled with but hopefully you can
Man062_Woman067_0689,realize that and overcome it definitely
Man062_Woman067_0690,one wish for you and I think that the
Man062_Woman067_0691,way that you would reach your happiness
Man062_Woman067_0692,is by being successful are you feeling
Man062_Woman067_0693,successful not being so that's what
Man062_Woman067_0694,feeling it yeah
Man062_Woman067_0695,have you ever cheated on me no actually
Man062_Woman067_0696,no that's lie I'm sorry
Man062_Woman067_0697,you've known actually I actually had a a
Man062_Woman067_0698,scene with someone and we ended up
Man062_Woman067_0699,kissing we did talk about it so yes I
Man062_Woman067_0700,have I had something I'm always gonna
Man062_Woman067_0701,regret I'm always gonna that's something
Man062_Woman067_0702,I can take back that's something I would
Man062_Woman067_0703,never would have gone over to her house
Man062_Woman067_0704,never would have read the scene with her
Man062_Woman067_0705,and every would have done anything like
Man062_Woman067_0706,that wasn't it and I know how much it
Man062_Woman067_0707,hurts you don't honestly I'm actually
Man062_Woman067_0708,over it now but at the time it was hard
Man062_Woman067_0709,no I know it's still something that's
Man062_Woman067_0710,not right yeah so I was just kind of
Man062_Woman067_0711,it's hard do you feel that emotional
Man062_Woman067_0712,cheating or physical cheating is worse I
Man062_Woman067_0713,feel like both is worse you can't really
Man062_Woman067_0714,I think once it's hard to mend something
Man062_Woman067_0715,like that once you've done that and it
Man062_Woman067_0716,was so hard to be honest with you about
Man062_Woman067_0717,it because it's something I couldn't
Man062_Woman067_0718,believe I did myself yeah just I think
Man062_Woman067_0719,that was like I'm one of us one of our
Man062_Woman067_0720,hardest times in our relationship yes
Man062_Woman067_0721,during the long distance it was during
Man062_Woman067_0722,the long distance yes about you no no no
Man062_Woman067_0723,I'm like and you know about this - I
Man062_Woman067_0724,like emotionally cheated where I was
Man062_Woman067_0725,like feeling really detached from you
Man062_Woman067_0726,and they started texting very
Man062_Woman067_0727,yeah
Man062_Woman067_0728,how has the baby changed our
Man062_Woman067_0729,relationship in a way you wish it had
Man062_Woman067_0730,not that's something that you don't like
Man062_Woman067_0731,um just the time alone together I think
Man062_Woman067_0732,I mean it's still fairly new and we're
Man062_Woman067_0733,still adjusting and finding a balance
Man062_Woman067_0734,but I think it's the hardest part no
Man062_Woman067_0735,sexy time
Man062_Woman067_0736,not as much sexy time yeah I like having
Man062_Woman067_0737,to like schedule it or get an
Man062_Woman067_0738,appointment that's been the hardest part
Man062_Woman067_0739,for me and not feeling like physically
Man062_Woman067_0740,close to you as often as we used to and
Man062_Woman067_0741,not being physically you know as I was
Man062_Woman067_0742,healing and stuff like that not
Man062_Woman067_0743,physically being able to I think that
Man062_Woman067_0744,was really hard mm-hmm yeah I think
Man062_Woman067_0745,that's the hardest part so far but I
Man062_Woman067_0746,know there's me way bigger challenges to
Man062_Woman067_0747,come still fairly new yeah we can pencil
Man062_Woman067_0748,more things in map times why do you love
Man062_Woman067_0749,me why do I love you
Man062_Woman067_0750,well first of all the reason why I do
Man062_Woman067_0751,love you is because of Charlotte but
Man062_Woman067_0752,before that I could never find anyone or
Man062_Woman067_0753,not that I was looking for them so let
Man062_Woman067_0754,me rephrase that but I never I didn't
Man062_Woman067_0755,know anyone that looked at me in the
Man062_Woman067_0756,same ways you looked at me you looked at
Man062_Woman067_0757,me in a certain way which I I wanted I
Man062_Woman067_0758,really really wanted and it made it I
Man062_Woman067_0759,made it so much more easy to love you
Man062_Woman067_0760,because the way that you used to look at
Man062_Woman067_0761,me it was just something that was a
Man062_Woman067_0762,completed my day it made me feel
Man062_Woman067_0763,maybe feel I could do anything and admit
Man062_Woman067_0764,I made me feel okay I had never had
Man062_Woman067_0765,anyone else look at me like that
Man062_Woman067_0766,never say I love you and mean it
Man062_Woman067_0767,what do you love about me that I don't
Man062_Woman067_0768,see with myself your big heart your
Man062_Woman067_0769,potential um the fact that you're so
Man062_Woman067_0770,generous you have a big heart but
Man062_Woman067_0771,sometimes it gets misconstrued into
Man062_Woman067_0772,being like I said too generous the wrong
Man062_Woman067_0773,people you constantly do nice things for
Man062_Woman067_0774,people that yet sometimes I think you
Man062_Woman067_0775,forget to do nice things for yourself
Man062_Woman067_0776,and do nice things for us and do nice
Man062_Woman067_0777,things for people who love and care
Man062_Woman067_0778,about you it's like and and I think it
Man062_Woman067_0779,all stems back to you constantly seeking
Man062_Woman067_0780,acceptance from like your mom and
Man062_Woman067_0781,they're pushing you away but you
Man062_Woman067_0782,constantly wanted her to love you and I
Man062_Woman067_0783,think that you transition that in being
Man062_Woman067_0784,generous to the wrong people you're
Man062_Woman067_0785,you're constantly wanting to seek
Man062_Woman067_0786,acceptance from these people who aren't
Man062_Woman067_0787,really looking out for the best interest
Man062_Woman067_0788,of you so I think that the biggest thing
Man062_Woman067_0789,that you don't see in yourself is that
Man062_Woman067_0790,you have such a big heart and you're so
Man062_Woman067_0791,generous but you forget that sometimes
Man062_Woman067_0792,and it gets wrapped up in the wrong
Man062_Woman067_0793,things I think that's so fun it was it
Man062_Woman067_0794,was more like deep than I thought
Man062_Woman067_0795,yeah like light-hearted and like fun
Man062_Woman067_0796,question
Man062_Woman067_0797,no not really no I I think everything is
Man062_Woman067_0798,kind of that that was actually one thing
Man062_Woman067_0799,I actually was kind of afraid to be
Man062_Woman067_0800,asked was the my addiction so I never
Man062_Woman067_0801,really thought I was gonna be talking
Man062_Woman067_0802,about that but it's something I'm glad
Man062_Woman067_0803,that we had Sara asked me because I get
Man062_Woman067_0804,to put it out there because there's not
Man062_Woman067_0805,too many time that we have together that
Man062_Woman067_0806,I can be really honest with her and
Man062_Woman067_0807,having that kind of brings us back
Man062_Woman067_0808,together
