Man069_Man070_0001,what do you remember about the first
Man069_Man070_0002,time we met that was fun
Man069_Man070_0003,yeah well from what I do remember of
Man069_Man070_0004,that night it was at the Eagle it was
Man069_Man070_0005,during the Halloween weekend and it was
Man069_Man070_0006,the beginning of it because not that
Man069_Man070_0007,many people are dressed up and of course
Man069_Man070_0008,little me was completely dressed out a
Man069_Man070_0009,nasty pig and I think I was wearing a
Man069_Man070_0010,harness and some little shorts that's
Man069_Man070_0011,all I remember
Man069_Man070_0012,yeah but you've got like some weird like
Man069_Man070_0013,pigs now around my neck okay that was it
Man069_Man070_0014,that's what made it the pig and you were
Man069_Man070_0015,I think you had flannel on or something
Man069_Man070_0016,and I went with my friend Eric cuz we
Man069_Man070_0017,were work neighbors and it was our first
Man069_Man070_0018,time out I was trying to pay attention
Man069_Man070_0019,to him but then I saw you and I was like
Man069_Man070_0020,who is that man and he's like oh I know
Man069_Man070_0021,him I was like then introduce us so uh
Man069_Man070_0022,he somehow introduced us and we just hit
Man069_Man070_0023,it off they were just drink all night
Man069_Man070_0024,mm-hmm
Man069_Man070_0025,okay I just want to see how you
Man069_Man070_0026,remembered it that's all yeah I remember
Man069_Man070_0027,that
Man069_Man070_0028,and I just remember immediately being
Man069_Man070_0029,attracted to you like I feel like you
Man069_Man070_0030,yeah so I saw you with Eric and I I
Man069_Man070_0031,think I remember coming out of the
Man069_Man070_0032,bathroom or something is when I firm
Man069_Man070_0033,ember seeing you but I just remember you
Man069_Man070_0034,being in a harness dressed like super
Man069_Man070_0035,eagle like everything out yeah like yeah
Man069_Man070_0036,that was funny
Man069_Man070_0037,I am I don't remember if I was dressed
Man069_Man070_0038,up or not though cuz a part of me feels
Man069_Man070_0039,like I was dressed up but then I can't
Man069_Man070_0040,remember no you were just like was I no
Man069_Man070_0041,human being
Man069_Man070_0042,oh that's like the horror I wasn't
Man069_Man070_0043,dressed up in like a Halloween costume
Man069_Man070_0044,though no no I remember anything about
Man069_Man070_0045,that no you were just in like a flannel
Man069_Man070_0046,shirt oh okay well you don't get it what
Man069_Man070_0047,it wasn't a costume okay I can't
Man069_Man070_0048,remember that was unless you are a
Man069_Man070_0049,lumberjack
Man069_Man070_0050,maybe a lumberjack here's my costume
Man069_Man070_0051,right okay yeah that's probably how I
Man069_Man070_0052,remember it too
Man069_Man070_0053,yeah yeah and it's funny knowing you now
Man069_Man070_0054,and then thinking about that when you
Man069_Man070_0055,just said like who's that introduce me
Man069_Man070_0056,to him it's so funny now to think about
Man069_Man070_0057,it on the other side of the fence almost
Man069_Man070_0058,yeah cuz not knowing you then like I
Man069_Man070_0059,don't know like how you are with your
Man069_Man070_0060,friends and now you're like that with me
Man069_Man070_0061,yeah so it's funny now because I can
Man069_Man070_0062,totally see like the other side of that
Man069_Man070_0063,fence like that's true the way that you
Man069_Man070_0064,have your banter and stuff that's really
Man069_Man070_0065,funny
Man069_Man070_0066,I never thought of that before probably
Man069_Man070_0067,went up to you like how's your night
Man069_Man070_0068,going you having fun
Man069_Man070_0069,I remember you being like pretty
Man069_Man070_0070,aggressive yeah not like an abrasive way
Man069_Man070_0071,just aggressive yeah so it's not
Man069_Man070_0072,something I wanted what do you love
Man069_Man070_0073,about me one your sense of humor
Man069_Man070_0074,cuz I think it's pretty funny that we
Man069_Man070_0075,can keep going off on little tangents
Man069_Man070_0076,and those are always my favorite people
Man069_Man070_0077,and - you're like really unaffected by
Man069_Man070_0078,living in the city and being hmm I don't
Man069_Man070_0079,know you're really genuine and really
Man069_Man070_0080,warm yeah it's not like you're affected
Man069_Man070_0081,by I guess what I'm in to say is like
Man069_Man070_0082,you're not affected in the way like you
Man069_Man070_0083,haven't been sort of I hate to say jaded
Man069_Man070_0084,cuz I hate to use that word but you're
Man069_Man070_0085,not like warped over by things like that
Man069_Man070_0086,yeah as much as I wish you were like
Man069_Man070_0087,more tough with boys sometimes I wish I
Man069_Man070_0088,also loved that you're not because it
Man069_Man070_0089,makes you so easy to relate to and stuff
Man069_Man070_0090,that make sense yeah
Man069_Man070_0091,how would you define our relationship I
Man069_Man070_0092,would say at this current spot I can
Man069_Man070_0093,tell you one of my best friends I could
Man069_Man070_0094,go to you with any kind of question or
Man069_Man070_0095,any story write anything in know you're
Man069_Man070_0096,there to help me out
Man069_Man070_0097,veer me in one direction or another yeah
Man069_Man070_0098,and for the most part you're always
Man069_Man070_0099,unbiased so that I feel like whatever
Man069_Man070_0100,maybe I'll go to you okay
Man069_Man070_0101,and I feel like there's never shame in
Man069_Man070_0102,it either there's no judgment on either
Man069_Man070_0103,part and it was the answer I don't want
Man069_Man070_0104,to hear I still go to you and knowing
Man069_Man070_0105,like it's something I need to hear so
Man069_Man070_0106,yeah and I would say one of my best
Man069_Man070_0107,friends right yeah
Man069_Man070_0108,same teach again cool what is it about
Man069_Man070_0109,me that makes you think I understand you
Man069_Man070_0110,um I think there's a lot of things about
Man069_Man070_0111,you even though there's not a lot of
Man069_Man070_0112,like age difference I know we joke about
Man069_Man070_0113,that a lot
Man069_Man070_0114,[Laughter]
Man069_Man070_0115,I feel like you understand me because a
Man069_Man070_0116,lot of times I think there's a lot of
Man069_Man070_0117,things that I see in myself and not to
Man069_Man070_0118,say like oh like I saw that when I was
Man069_Man070_0119,your age because I don't feel like that
Man069_Man070_0120,consciously there's just a lot of things
Man069_Man070_0121,and like your energy level and like the
Man069_Man070_0122,things that you go for and you talk
Man069_Man070_0123,about and like you've bounced around
Man069_Man070_0124,about like there's a lot of those
Man069_Man070_0125,instances where maybe I'm not as
Man069_Man070_0126,enthusiastic about it now like let me go
Man069_Man070_0127,out or we do things like I'm I'm more
Man069_Man070_0128,boring now probably I want to stay home
Man069_Man070_0129,and cook and drink wine I think be
Man069_Man070_0130,really super old but I see a lot of the
Man069_Man070_0131,things that you do in the way that I
Man069_Man070_0132,used to be and more so and I love that I
Man069_Man070_0133,think it's super like super fun I think
Man069_Man070_0134,you understand me for a lot of those
Man069_Man070_0135,reasons and it's kind of like in
Man069_Man070_0136,specific instances where it's like you
Man069_Man070_0137,and I may be not like the same times in
Man069_Man070_0138,our life like I feel like there's a lot
Man069_Man070_0139,of times when we talk that I feel like
Man069_Man070_0140,I'm in a different place in my life than
Man069_Man070_0141,you are but I always feel like there's
Man069_Man070_0142,like a it's weird like at 25 or 26 like
Man069_Man070_0143,I was doing what you're doing and to me
Man069_Man070_0144,that feels very familiar familiar and
Man069_Man070_0145,very like it makes like a bond for me I
Man069_Man070_0146,guess is kind of how I always feel like
Man069_Man070_0147,you understand me I think our
Man069_Man070_0148,personalities are very like romantic and
Man069_Man070_0149,kind and like you know not to just like
Man069_Man070_0150,say all the great things about us okay
Man069_Man070_0151,like you have a you have like a big soft
Man069_Man070_0152,side and I think I mean I know I do too
Man069_Man070_0153,and I think that makes me always feel
Man069_Man070_0154,like you understand me as much as we
Man069_Man070_0155,have this exterior that we both
Man069_Man070_0156,similarly like like to portray and like
Man069_Man070_0157,want to sort of seem out really like
Man069_Man070_0158,you're really warm and you have like
Man069_Man070_0159,this big family gushy side and you know
Man069_Man070_0160,all that sort of thing and I have all
Man069_Man070_0161,those types of aspects and I think that
Man069_Man070_0162,just from the beginning even when we
Man069_Man070_0163,were dating like makes me always feel
Man069_Man070_0164,like you understand me or you understand
Man069_Man070_0165,where I'm coming from because you're
Man069_Man070_0166,close with your family and I don't know
Man069_Man070_0167,there's like a million reasons I guess
Man069_Man070_0168,when I really start to think about it of
Man069_Man070_0169,the things that we were late on and
Man069_Man070_0170,which I always think that you understand
Man069_Man070_0171,where I'm coming from when we talk about
Man069_Man070_0172,things and just any instance of like you
Man069_Man070_0173,know whether it's like a problem or that
Man069_Man070_0174,something we're excited for like a new
Man069_Man070_0175,boy a new job like all these different
Man069_Man070_0176,types of things so yeah I would say
Man069_Man070_0177,that's why yeah okay it's my turn right
Man069_Man070_0178,yeah okay what are you hesitant to tell
Man069_Man070_0179,me
Man069_Man070_0180,now is not the time to be hesitant I
Man069_Man070_0181,[Laughter]
Man069_Man070_0182,feel like we've been pretty honest all
Man069_Man070_0183,the time yeah mm I feel like when we
Man069_Man070_0184,first broke up I was hesitant I'm
Man069_Man070_0185,telling you how much I care for you
Man069_Man070_0186,still and it took me a while to like get
Man069_Man070_0187,over that like even when we were saying
Man069_Man070_0188,we were just friends I still like how to
Man069_Man070_0189,hope that's something one change okay
Man069_Man070_0190,and I think that's why I'm always on you
Man069_Man070_0191,with Jaime and how I felt like you need
Man069_Man070_0192,to let him go because I feel like I was
Man069_Man070_0193,in that spot and it took me so long and
Man069_Man070_0194,I was so emotionally attached where I
Man069_Man070_0195,you were in that spot with me yeah so
Man069_Man070_0196,like I see how Jaime is with you how I
Man069_Man070_0197,used to be with you and it's like that
Man069_Man070_0198,little that you give he he's gonna think
Man069_Man070_0199,it's so much more and that's why I'm
Man069_Man070_0200,like he just needed what that be for a
Man069_Man070_0201,bit mmm because it took me a while and
Man069_Man070_0202,now like I just he has an amazing friend
Man069_Man070_0203,yeah it took me that time yeah I mean I
Man069_Man070_0204,remember I distinctly remember you
Man069_Man070_0205,telling me that there was definitely
Man069_Man070_0206,like aspects of that where I was like an
Man069_Man070_0207,asshole and yeah like it almost took
Man069_Man070_0208,that to make you step away and like
Man069_Man070_0209,where we didn't talk for a while yeah
Man069_Man070_0210,and that moment where I could step away
Man069_Man070_0211,it's what I need it yeah because I was
Man069_Man070_0212,like oh no this guy's a dick Oh like I
Man069_Man070_0213,don't deal with him yeah
Man069_Man070_0214,because I felt like you weren't
Man069_Man070_0215,respecting me because which is probably
Man069_Man070_0216,true yeah I mean and it was I mean true
Man069_Man070_0217,haribol probably no it was but it
Man069_Man070_0218,happens like it's about timing and I
Man069_Man070_0219,feel like we say that all the time but
Man069_Man070_0220,it is like we weren't in the right time
Man069_Man070_0221,frame and then we just were on similar
Man069_Man070_0222,different paths at that moment that's
Man069_Man070_0223,true so I feel like that's why I'm
Man069_Man070_0224,always on you with
Man069_Man070_0225,or it's like just let it be for a little
Man069_Man070_0226,while you know because you're not a dick
Man069_Man070_0227,room you just don't know sometimes want
Man069_Man070_0228,that cake and eat it too much we all do
Man069_Man070_0229,so I'm no perfect angel yeah but yeah I
Man069_Man070_0230,feel like I was a little more hesitant
Man069_Man070_0231,than to let you know how I truly felt
Man069_Man070_0232,okay that makes sense I guess I mean I
Man069_Man070_0233,think like think I mean at the time it
Man069_Man070_0234,definitely felt there's like a lot of
Man069_Man070_0235,things but it was one of those like walk
Man069_Man070_0236,away from it like there was several
Man069_Man070_0237,times where I felt like we kept trying
Man069_Man070_0238,and like it just never fit or like
Man069_Man070_0239,things kept fucking up and it didn't I
Man069_Man070_0240,mean we had like an around Valentine's
Man069_Man070_0241,Day
Man069_Man070_0242,that was like one situation that I
Man069_Man070_0243,always remembered really where did we go
Man069_Man070_0244,we went to that Italian place right next
Man069_Man070_0245,to your place oh yeah yeah and then the
Man069_Man070_0246,Japanese yeah at the end of the street
Man069_Man070_0247,yeah no I didn't go out on Valentine's
Man069_Man070_0248,and we're like we go that to the
Man069_Man070_0249,restaurant and we're sitting down and
Man069_Man070_0250,you're like why this is so busy and I'm
Man069_Man070_0251,like uh it's Valentine's and you're like
Man069_Man070_0252,oh that's right I'm in the back of my
Man069_Man070_0253,head I'm like oh you know what they hang
Man069_Man070_0254,out on this day but this was now it's
Man069_Man070_0255,I'm starting to remember that I don't
Man069_Man070_0256,know was a year after we met okay so we
Man069_Man070_0257,met huh data jobs you just met hi May
Man069_Man070_0258,you guys were like on a break that week
Man069_Man070_0259,okay so we decided to grab genomic gun
Man069_Man070_0260,off again yeah okay yeah is that when we
Man069_Man070_0261,started being friends though we were
Man069_Man070_0262,trying to be okay and what did I heard
Man069_Man070_0263,that I was like oh maybe there's hope oh
Man069_Man070_0264,we're having a Valentine's dinner
Man069_Man070_0265,together and then you were a dick kind
Man069_Man070_0266,of like gotta go because then I realized
Man069_Man070_0267,and I was still seeing it yeah okay
Man069_Man070_0268,that's right yeah I can't believe how
Man069_Man070_0269,long that's been some hangout and I
Man069_Man070_0270,think about it feels like agency also
Man069_Man070_0271,that I've we have been seeing him off
Man069_Man070_0272,and on and then also how are they called
Man069_Man070_0273,the series of events have gotten yeah I
Man069_Man070_0274,know what time it's just
Man069_Man070_0275,say all right is it your turn I keep
Man069_Man070_0276,losing track yeah tell me about the time
Man069_Man070_0277,I disappointed you and how do you feel
Man069_Man070_0278,about it now you disappointed me are you
Man069_Man070_0279,cold
Man069_Man070_0280,no that's okay no I'm okay I promise
Man069_Man070_0281,they get the time that you disappointed
Man069_Man070_0282,me I can't really remember a time where
Man069_Man070_0283,I feel like let down by you at all I
Man069_Man070_0284,think like through through everything I
Man069_Man070_0285,don't ever feel like I was like let down
Man069_Man070_0286,by you I remember being in my car the
Man069_Man070_0287,day that you called me to ask me some
Man069_Man070_0288,advice about a project that you were
Man069_Man070_0289,thinking about doing and I remember that
Man069_Man070_0290,made my wheels turn but I never felt let
Man069_Man070_0291,down and disappointed him not like ever
Man069_Man070_0292,it definitely like I told you in the car
Man069_Man070_0293,over here like it made me really like
Man069_Man070_0294,think about things a lot more and like I
Man069_Man070_0295,didn't want to judge or like have any
Man069_Man070_0296,type of feeling and that sort of sense
Man069_Man070_0297,but it made me sorry I'm not looking at
Man069_Man070_0298,you I'm like I never felt like
Man069_Man070_0299,disappointed or anything it was just one
Man069_Man070_0300,of those things where I was really
Man069_Man070_0301,really concerned because I really didn't
Man069_Man070_0302,want to see you go down a road that like
Man069_Man070_0303,was an immediate gratification of you
Man069_Man070_0304,know making money or having fun or like
Man069_Man070_0305,attention or any of those types of
Man069_Man070_0306,reasons because I know those things were
Man069_Man070_0307,like you know at certain times in our
Man069_Man070_0308,lives those are really really appealing
Man069_Man070_0309,and I didn't want that to be something
Man069_Man070_0310,that like fueled the fire for you to
Man069_Man070_0311,keep doing those types of things so I
Man069_Man070_0312,was like really really concerned but I'd
Man069_Man070_0313,never at the point where I felt let down
Man069_Man070_0314,or like disappointed or anything so
Man069_Man070_0315,that's good yeah
Man069_Man070_0316,what made you want to come back into my
Man069_Man070_0317,life well initially it was clear that I
Man069_Man070_0318,was hoping for more okay but after the I
Man069_Man070_0319,guess second breakup I don't know how
Man069_Man070_0320,our paths crossed again either one tests
Man069_Man070_0321,each other or we saw each other at the
Man069_Man070_0322,bar whatever me when you were just
Man069_Man070_0323,talking about the Valentine's Day that's
Man069_Man070_0324,exactly what I was trying to think - it
Man069_Man070_0325,was like how do how did this act yeah
Man069_Man070_0326,how did it come back together yeah I
Man069_Man070_0327,don't know do you I don't remember yeah
Man069_Man070_0328,I don't remember but whatever it may be
Man069_Man070_0329,yeah I think cuz when we came when we
Man069_Man070_0330,came back it was like definitely as a
Man069_Man070_0331,friendship yeah there was like no
Man069_Man070_0332,question about it right and I didn't
Man069_Man070_0333,even feel slightly uncomfortable about
Man069_Man070_0334,that this was a good feeling
Man069_Man070_0335,mm-hmm but whatever it may be I feel
Man069_Man070_0336,like the universe for some reason made
Man069_Man070_0337,our paths cross again and I knew in the
Man069_Man070_0338,back of my mind that you were an amazing
Man069_Man070_0339,person
Man069_Man070_0340,and regardless if I was gonna be
Man069_Man070_0341,romantic or a friendship photonic I want
Man069_Man070_0342,to you to be around for whatever it may
Man069_Man070_0343,be
Man069_Man070_0344,yeah so I want to at least be around me
Man069_Man070_0345,a little more to see what kind of
Man069_Man070_0346,dynamic we would share and I'm glad I
Man069_Man070_0347,did because now we have this great bond
Man069_Man070_0348,and I can imagine having you in my life
Man069_Man070_0349,no we're done the Stars knew what they
Man069_Man070_0350,were doing why are you why are you
Man069_Man070_0351,maintaining this friendship I get a lot
Man069_Man070_0352,out of it and it's a lot of fun it's
Man069_Man070_0353,probably one of the most like rewarding
Man069_Man070_0354,friendships in terms of like seeing it
Man069_Man070_0355,grow from meeting you like romantically
Man069_Man070_0356,and then things sort of dating falling
Man069_Man070_0357,apart like looking back feeling like I
Man069_Man070_0358,was an asshole and feeling like I could
Man069_Man070_0359,have easily like never seen you again
Man069_Man070_0360,and being the one to look back and think
Man069_Man070_0361,like wow like most people would have
Man069_Man070_0362,just moved on and
Man069_Man070_0363,you would have never seen them again
Man069_Man070_0364,because there's a lot of relationships
Man069_Man070_0365,that I've I mean I've had a lot of
Man069_Man070_0366,relationships where you have like in my
Man069_Man070_0367,mind I call it like the fucked up
Man069_Man070_0368,friendship we're like you were either
Man069_Man070_0369,sleeping together or your boyfriends and
Man069_Man070_0370,like you're always kind of like
Man069_Man070_0371,flirtatious like fuck friends yeah so
Man069_Man070_0372,that your dynamic is always like rooted
Man069_Man070_0373,and flirtation or it's rooted in hooking
Man069_Man070_0374,up or like whatever those things are
Man069_Man070_0375,because of I mean I'm sure you know you
Man069_Man070_0376,do too like I've had lots of those
Man069_Man070_0377,friends and they're like all based in
Man069_Man070_0378,like what was initially something
Man069_Man070_0379,romantic but our friendship was really
Man069_Man070_0380,different in like it's moved past like
Man069_Man070_0381,any of those stages and we never even
Man069_Man070_0382,really had like a weird friendship like
Man069_Man070_0383,what are we are we hooking up are we not
Man069_Man070_0384,like we never really had that phase like
Man069_Man070_0385,maybe like one night that I can remember
Man069_Man070_0386,but it moved past all that and then it
Man069_Man070_0387,moved into a friendship that's like
Man069_Man070_0388,progressing even more we're like we're
Man069_Man070_0389,doing life cycle together this year and
Man069_Man070_0390,like all these things that I don't know
Man069_Man070_0391,there's really important to me and
Man069_Man070_0392,they're really like it's just amazing
Man069_Man070_0393,because I don't know I know that I have
Man069_Man070_0394,other friends that I've progressed and
Man069_Man070_0395,that sort of sense but it's just really
Man069_Man070_0396,interesting because our dynamic has
Man069_Man070_0397,changed like several times I feel like
Man069_Man070_0398,and it's continued to grow and I feel
Man069_Man070_0399,like with that it's like stronger and
Man069_Man070_0400,stronger every time and it's just like I
Man069_Man070_0401,can be more not that I've like never
Man069_Man070_0402,been real with you but it's like there's
Man069_Man070_0403,nothing that I can say or be or any of
Man069_Man070_0404,those types of things like even if it's
Man069_Man070_0405,you know like if we're aggregating or
Man069_Man070_0406,whatever like it's never one of those
Man069_Man070_0407,things where I feel like it's gonna
Man069_Man070_0408,change something or I have to like watch
Man069_Man070_0409,myself with yeah so I don't know and I
Man069_Man070_0410,just feel like more than anything like
Man069_Man070_0411,we laugh a lot
Man069_Man070_0412,um so yeah not to sound selfish but like
Man069_Man070_0413,I get a lot out of it and it's fun yeah
Man069_Man070_0414,there you go
Man069_Man070_0415,all about the progression with that yeah
Man069_Man070_0416,long span I guess it's the way I think
Man069_Man070_0417,of it even though it hasn't been that
Man069_Man070_0418,many years that we've come so far and
Man069_Man070_0419,like through at times where I would
Man069_Man070_0420,think like just forget it I mean and now
Man069_Man070_0421,it's funny because there's like I'm much
Man069_Man070_0422,choosier about who I put work into with
Man069_Man070_0423,like relationships and meeting people
Man069_Man070_0424,and all that type of stuff and I used to
Man069_Man070_0425,be like putting work into everything I
Man069_Man070_0426,feel like and now I'm much more like
Man069_Man070_0427,reserved and friendships relationships
Man069_Man070_0428,like people I meet like any of those
Man069_Man070_0429,types of things and it's like I guess
Man069_Man070_0430,I'm just becoming choosier in that sense
Man069_Man070_0431,and it's nice that I feel like I put in
Man069_Man070_0432,work and then the same thing as like
Man069_Man070_0433,brought on from your side so I never
Man069_Man070_0434,feel like I'm like you know god I wish
Man069_Man070_0435,she would like plans up there I wish
Man069_Man070_0436,this or that like I never think that
Man069_Man070_0437,stuff with you so it's really nice your
Man069_Man070_0438,turn what do you think I'm searching for
Man069_Man070_0439,in a partner
Man069_Man070_0440,I think you're searching for the one but
Man069_Man070_0441,I think you want someone that you're
Man069_Man070_0442,gonna build I think this is something
Man069_Man070_0443,that I'm probably answering myself as
Man069_Man070_0444,well because I think that you and I have
Man069_Man070_0445,it very similar in this aspect where
Man069_Man070_0446,you're looking for somebody that's gonna
Man069_Man070_0447,be your best friend for like the rest of
Man069_Man070_0448,your life to have adventures with and be
Man069_Man070_0449,your buddy and like do all these things
Man069_Man070_0450,and see all these things and like I
Man069_Man070_0451,think you want that type of relationship
Man069_Man070_0452,and you're super romantic and super
Man069_Man070_0453,sweet and warm and you want a family and
Man069_Man070_0454,all those types of things
Man069_Man070_0455,physically I don't know ranges so I
Man069_Man070_0456,can't describe any type of physicality
Man069_Man070_0457,because it's pretty very heat sure but
Man069_Man070_0458,yeah yeah I think more in terms of like
Man069_Man070_0459,what you're looking for in somebody
Man069_Man070_0460,that's what I would see yeah
Man069_Man070_0461,so yeah does that answer your question I
Man069_Man070_0462,think so
Man069_Man070_0463,okay I mean the best I probably could
Man069_Man070_0464,even answer it okay yeah I don't know
Man069_Man070_0465,what he's gonna look like but yeah you
Man069_Man070_0466,have a wide reality that's not attic
Man069_Man070_0467,will probably be just like that yeah
Man069_Man070_0468,yeah I think it's gonna happen which I
Man069_Man070_0469,think this is maybe just my own opinion
Man069_Man070_0470,but I think it's gonna happen later than
Man069_Man070_0471,we would all love but I think it's there
Man069_Man070_0472,yeah yeah what is preventing me from
Man069_Man070_0473,happiness / becoming the man I want to
Man069_Man070_0474,be
Man069_Man070_0475,I think in your career you're doing an
Man069_Man070_0476,amazing job and you're very determined
Man069_Man070_0477,and set and you know what you want so
Man069_Man070_0478,it's happening in your relationship I
Man069_Man070_0479,feel that you're still very hesitant on
Man069_Man070_0480,yourself in a sense that you don't see
Man069_Man070_0481,your true beauty where like I see you as
Man069_Man070_0482,a some amazing man that's one physically
Man069_Man070_0483,attractive emotionally interactive and
Man069_Man070_0484,like courage event and anyone would be
Man069_Man070_0485,lucky to have you and I don't think you
Man069_Man070_0486,see that in yourself okay I think you
Man069_Man070_0487,don't think I think kind of emotional I
Man069_Man070_0488,think you still doubt yourself and you
Man069_Man070_0489,put yourself down a lot and you and I
Man069_Man070_0490,know I do it yeah I'm not saying like
Man069_Man070_0491,it's not a norm you know humans do it
Man069_Man070_0492,yeah but I just wish you did it and I
Man069_Man070_0493,wish you saw yourself in my sight
Man069_Man070_0494,because if he did you would just
Man069_Man070_0495,flourish oh well and that man would
Man069_Man070_0496,notice it and come to you and you don't
Man069_Man070_0497,need a chase anyone let them chase you
Man069_Man070_0498,because you deserve to be chased so ya
Man069_Man070_0499,realize your beauty okay that's really
Man069_Man070_0500,sweet
Man069_Man070_0501,all right what do you wish you could
Man069_Man070_0502,have changed about me during our
Man069_Man070_0503,relationship in order to make it work my
Man069_Man070_0504,turn
Man069_Man070_0505,it was yeah oh but we'll both answer do
Man069_Man070_0506,you want to answer it you would ask me
Man069_Man070_0507,[Music]
Man069_Man070_0508,now that I look at it nothing because I
Man069_Man070_0509,feel that at the end of the day we
Man069_Man070_0510,wouldn't have worked okay I was just I
Man069_Man070_0511,was like yeah I feel like I want to add
Man069_Man070_0512,to this question because then I want to
Man069_Man070_0513,know that as well okay I don't know why
Man069_Man070_0514,we want it because I love you so much
Man069_Man070_0515,but something in me is saying that it
Man069_Man070_0516,just wouldn't have happened
Man069_Man070_0517,yeah I think we've worked better as an
Man069_Man070_0518,amazing friendship I don't know why cuz
Man069_Man070_0519,I feel like it's actually we were well
Man069_Man070_0520,mm-hmm and clearly that's important to
Man069_Man070_0521,me that works but do you think you I
Man069_Man070_0522,mean yeah they're like that's what I
Man069_Man070_0523,would have changed okay if it would have
Man069_Man070_0524,continued for two years five years X
Man069_Man070_0525,amount of years whatever maybe it would
Man069_Man070_0526,have been the timing yeah and that would
Man069_Man070_0527,have been nice to both have been in
Man069_Man070_0528,similar paths at the same time to have
Man069_Man070_0529,dated younger and getting that
Man069_Man070_0530,relationship to see you in more of that
Man069_Man070_0531,light mm-hmm
Man069_Man070_0532,that wouldn't have fun but now I'm glad
Man069_Man070_0533,I worked out the way it did yeah but
Man069_Man070_0534,yeah if I would have changed something
Man069_Man070_0535,at that time it would have been that
Man069_Man070_0536,having you in the mindset where you
Man069_Man070_0537,still want I feel like you were affected
Man069_Man070_0538,by previous relationships I was just
Man069_Man070_0539,gonna say the same thing
Man069_Man070_0540,and especially with Craig I felt like
Man069_Man070_0541,you were really affected by Craig still
Man069_Man070_0542,I was really a fan and I at the time I
Man069_Man070_0543,thought I was okay and every time it
Man069_Man070_0544,happened I think that's why it was like
Man069_Man070_0545,years I mean literally like thinking
Man069_Man070_0546,back it was like a couple years that it
Man069_Man070_0547,came to get over it and maybe it's
Man069_Man070_0548,because I kept jumping in and out of
Man069_Man070_0549,things but I definitely I definitely saw
Man069_Man070_0550,that as like what I did with you right
Man069_Man070_0551,like jumped in it realized that you were
Man069_Man070_0552,in it at a different place than I was
Man069_Man070_0553,and then like I jumped back out of it
Man069_Man070_0554,and I did that to several guys which is
Man069_Man070_0555,the shitty thing to do and it's
Man069_Man070_0556,something that I don't want to repeat
Man069_Man070_0557,again but and it like that's exactly
Man069_Man070_0558,what I was gonna say would be like I
Man069_Man070_0559,remember that about myself more than
Man069_Man070_0560,anything it's like two different places
Man069_Man070_0561,and my mindset was not there which what
Man069_Man070_0562,did everything that had happened and
Man069_Man070_0563,like where I was at and like I wanted it
Man069_Man070_0564,but then you you can't like want things
Man069_Man070_0565,to happen that aren't ready to happen or
Man069_Man070_0566,that you're not ready at work but yeah I
Man069_Man070_0567,feel like I'm still we're like just you
Man069_Man070_0568,weren't ready yeah like you didn't
Man069_Man070_0569,realize it until it was blatantly out
Man069_Man070_0570,there that I was ready yeah and it was
Man069_Man070_0571,like oh kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah and
Man069_Man070_0572,I feel like now you're I have hailed
Man069_Man070_0573,from it from what has happened since
Man069_Man070_0574,with him and you know that you've been
Man069_Man070_0575,able to just let it go
Man069_Man070_0576,yeah I'm most part oh yeah we haven't
Man069_Man070_0577,talked too much about it but no I would
Man069_Man070_0578,I mean like there's been so many phases
Man069_Man070_0579,and stuff and like I'd let it go and
Man069_Man070_0580,then there was like the resurfacing of a
Man069_Man070_0581,friendship and then like when that's
Man069_Man070_0582,what I went to shit I I like I remember
Man069_Man070_0583,getting the text message from him and it
Man069_Man070_0584,was just like I felt so indifferent
Man069_Man070_0585,about it and I just felt so why do I
Man069_Man070_0586,even bother like yeah I'm tired of
Man069_Man070_0587,thinking about you and
Man069_Man070_0588,it's been it's been good yeah enough
Man069_Man070_0589,like and it was I felt good going back
Man069_Man070_0590,and having a friendship with him and I
Man069_Man070_0591,thought that was like the answer but
Man069_Man070_0592,it's so weird how it all came back to
Man069_Man070_0593,yet again like okay okay okay and then
Man069_Man070_0594,he again from my part like feeling like
Man069_Man070_0595,he just like bailed again and I feel
Man069_Man070_0596,like he always will he maybe he will I
Man069_Man070_0597,don't know I mean I don't like to think
Man069_Man070_0598,about that but for me he did and it was
Man069_Man070_0599,one of those things where it's like I
Man069_Man070_0600,still see that affecting because I worry
Man069_Man070_0601,I think with doubting myself you were
Man069_Man070_0602,saying earlier like I always worry that
Man069_Man070_0603,now I'm like the walkaway Joe in
Man069_Man070_0604,relationships and stuff we're like I go
Man069_Man070_0605,into it and then I get like I sometimes
Man069_Man070_0606,still question whether I have that
Man069_Man070_0607,behavior and if it's like a learned
Man069_Man070_0608,behavior from like the time that you and
Man069_Man070_0609,I dated where I was I was doing that
Man069_Man070_0610,really hard but then I mean I've been
Man069_Man070_0611,like bouncing in and out of dating Jaime
Man069_Man070_0612,ever since then and yeah you know those
Man069_Man070_0613,types of things so it's funny the other
Man069_Man070_0614,day when you text me that's exactly like
Man069_Man070_0615,what I started like reflecting on like
Man069_Man070_0616,the past three days it's like what the
Man069_Man070_0617,fuck do you want yeah and go with it
Man069_Man070_0618,because it's totally the thing that I
Man069_Man070_0619,always like make a decision and I wonder
Man069_Man070_0620,whether the grass is greener again and I
Man069_Man070_0621,was talking to my sister about this and
Man069_Man070_0622,she's like I've never been that way like
Man069_Man070_0623,made a decision and I go with it I never
Man069_Man070_0624,looked back I never questioned my
Man069_Man070_0625,decisions and I was like I don't with
Man069_Man070_0626,work but I do with my personal life like
Man069_Man070_0627,2,000 percent with all of the things
Man069_Man070_0628,that I do I'm just it's so weird I don't
Man069_Man070_0629,know what it is is it because you feel
Man069_Man070_0630,like there's gonna be a better option
Man069_Man070_0631,you know I hate people like that do that
Man069_Man070_0632,kind of thing because I feel like that's
Man069_Man070_0633,such an I mean I hate to say like oh
Man069_Man070_0634,that's such an LA thing but moving here
Man069_Man070_0635,and living here for ten years like
Man069_Man070_0636,that's a very very big dynamic with
Man069_Man070_0637,people here and
Man069_Man070_0638,there's a lot of options it's a lot of
Man069_Man070_0639,options and I think there's also that
Man069_Man070_0640,mentality of like you know there's
Man069_Man070_0641,always gonna be like something better to
Man069_Man070_0642,do something better that's gonna come
Man069_Man070_0643,along and like I I don't have that
Man069_Man070_0644,problem like with plans and friends and
Man069_Man070_0645,any of those types of things and I
Man069_Man070_0646,honestly don't feel like I do that with
Man069_Man070_0647,people I just think that sometimes I
Man069_Man070_0648,think sometimes I have unrealistic
Man069_Man070_0649,standards with certain things because I
Man069_Man070_0650,know that I'm like kind of high
Man069_Man070_0651,maintenance and like there's those
Man069_Man070_0652,living standards and then there's like
Man069_Man070_0653,standards and I feel like maybe don't
Man069_Man070_0654,have unrealistic standards on people
Man069_Man070_0655,okay sometimes I worry that I do just
Man069_Man070_0656,because I know that I have really high
Man069_Man070_0657,like expectations and people but I think
Man069_Man070_0658,that if you're gonna deliver to someone
Man069_Man070_0659,you shouldn't get it back in return and
Man069_Man070_0660,that's why I think clearly if a one
Man069_Man070_0661,person understands you they're gonna be
Man069_Man070_0662,more okay wait I don't know but I guess
Man069_Man070_0663,that's why I always fear that I like you
Man069_Man070_0664,know bounce back and forth and those
Man069_Man070_0665,types of things we've gotten like a long
Man069_Man070_0666,way off this question okay is it my turn
Man069_Man070_0667,or eternity so it was supposed to be
Man069_Man070_0668,mine so why don't you take this one okay
Man069_Man070_0669,okay and that will be back on path all
Man069_Man070_0670,right what's
Man069_Man070_0671,[Music]
Man069_Man070_0672,oh sorry I was really configure out what
Man069_Man070_0673,I thought this was like an abbreviated
Man069_Man070_0674,letter what's the pain in me you'd like
Man069_Man070_0675,to heal
Man069_Man070_0676,I think we've somewhat covered it but
Man069_Man070_0677,it's you just not realizing your own
Man069_Man070_0678,beauty you you realize in just what how
Man069_Man070_0679,much you're gonna offer in a man mm-hmm
Man069_Man070_0680,and how you need to realize that you
Man069_Man070_0681,deserve the same in return I thought
Man069_Man070_0682,that you still in the back your mind
Man069_Man070_0683,fear that the skies you're not enough
Man069_Man070_0684,with everybody mm-hmm everyone I just
Man069_Man070_0685,think I don't always I mean I know I
Man069_Man070_0686,don't like consciously think that I know
Man069_Man070_0687,I consciously thought that when I was
Man069_Man070_0688,seeing Matt over the summer
Man069_Man070_0689,I know I thought that a lot yeah and I
Man069_Man070_0690,don't typically think that like
Man069_Man070_0691,consciously and I think that was the
Man069_Man070_0692,most recent one and that's why I I still
Man069_Man070_0693,think that mmm is because what Matt you
Man069_Man070_0694,were perfect for him and he didn't
Man069_Man070_0695,realize that and it's all about timing
Man069_Man070_0696,yeah and I feel like you see that
Man069_Man070_0697,relationship as a down part on you when
Man069_Man070_0698,it was all in his court of why it didn't
Man069_Man070_0699,work out so you put a lot of energy into
Man069_Man070_0700,that one yeah even if it was somewhat
Man069_Man070_0701,short term but I knew I affected you a
Man069_Man070_0702,good amount and that sucks no it does
Man069_Man070_0703,yeah a relationship affects you and then
Man069_Man070_0704,negative like yeah I think it sucks I
Man069_Man070_0705,mean where it's right now I guess it
Man069_Man070_0706,just sucks cuz I was really hoping that
Man069_Man070_0707,it would be like a return to a
Man069_Man070_0708,friendship or some sort of like a
Man069_Man070_0709,snowball into a back to friends even you
Man069_Man070_0710,know we were
Man069_Man070_0711,was always a little yeah flirtatious but
Man069_Man070_0712,yeah yeah because he looked he was a
Man069_Man070_0713,good guy but he just wasn't in the
Man069_Man070_0714,correct mindset yeah and I mean I told
Man069_Man070_0715,me like still hoping that it was gonna
Man069_Man070_0716,change but I just was too soon
Man069_Man070_0717,definitely I guess that's where my hope
Man069_Man070_0718,comes from now we're like I wish we
Man069_Man070_0719,could have just have a good friendship
Man069_Man070_0720,but it doesn't feel like we do and it
Man069_Man070_0721,probably won't be that way cuz I don't
Man069_Man070_0722,think he's the type of man that can do
Man069_Man070_0723,that or at least no right now I don't
Man069_Man070_0724,know but you need to stop thinking it's
Man069_Man070_0725,something you've done or it's something
Man069_Man070_0726,about you it's the reason why it it's
Man069_Man070_0727,not happening fair enough okay what do
Man069_Man070_0728,you love about me that I don't see with
Man069_Man070_0729,myself I feel like there's a couple of
Man069_Man070_0730,things you don't see I mean one I
Man069_Man070_0731,definitely don't think that you realize
Man069_Man070_0732,that you look really good cuz you always
Man069_Man070_0733,say that you want to be like this or
Man069_Man070_0734,that or the other things and like I
Man069_Man070_0735,think you look really good
Man069_Man070_0736,I mean we spend all summer at the beach
Man069_Man070_0737,together running around in speedos so I
Man069_Man070_0738,think you look pretty damn good Michael
Man069_Man070_0739,um I wish you realized that thank you I
Man069_Man070_0740,think that I think that you probably
Man069_Man070_0741,don't give yourself enough credit for
Man069_Man070_0742,how far you've come in a really short I
Man069_Man070_0743,would say like a year year and a half I
Man069_Man070_0744,think that you've progressed and made a
Man069_Man070_0745,lot of changes and like done a lot of
Man069_Man070_0746,things to change your life you know like
Man069_Man070_0747,moving into the city officially getting
Man069_Man070_0748,a job doing all the things that you're
Man069_Man070_0749,doing right now sometimes I feel like
Man069_Man070_0750,you cut that short and you don't
Man069_Man070_0751,necessarily give yourself enough credit
Man069_Man070_0752,for that and I'm guilty of it too so I
Man069_Man070_0753,can relate I mean I I feel like I relate
Man069_Man070_0754,to a lot of those things but
Man069_Man070_0755,I think that your motivation and your
Man069_Man070_0756,constant need to look forward is
Man069_Man070_0757,something that's really attractive
Man069_Man070_0758,because you're really really
Man069_Man070_0759,goal-oriented and you're always
Man069_Man070_0760,concerned about like well this is great
Man069_Man070_0761,but this is only gonna be great for six
Man069_Man070_0762,weeks or six months or three months or
Man069_Man070_0763,whatever it is that you you know set for
Man069_Man070_0764,yourself and I think that's really
Man069_Man070_0765,attractive but at the same time I don't
Man069_Man070_0766,think that you give yourself enough
Man069_Man070_0767,credit for like being on your own living
Man069_Man070_0768,you know moving down here and just sort
Man069_Man070_0769,of like setting up a new life for
Man069_Man070_0770,yourself even though it's you know an
Man069_Man070_0771,hour and a half to your parents house or
Man069_Man070_0772,whatever it is but living here and
Man069_Man070_0773,living there is like two different
Man069_Man070_0774,worlds and the way of life is so
Man069_Man070_0775,different and you know I think that
Man069_Man070_0776,that's like a big step and I mean it
Man069_Man070_0777,that's been a really long time for me
Man069_Man070_0778,since I've done that and I thinking back
Man069_Man070_0779,about how I did it I think it's it's
Man069_Man070_0780,brave when people do that I think it's
Man069_Man070_0781,really exciting and stuff and I think
Man069_Man070_0782,that's definitely one of the things that
Man069_Man070_0783,I loved when you just sort of like
Man069_Man070_0784,kick-started your motivation and like
Man069_Man070_0785,you quit Apple and you changed
Man069_Man070_0786,everything and you were ready to make a
Man069_Man070_0787,difference and I don't know I loved that
Man069_Man070_0788,as much as I didn't love going around to
Man069_Man070_0789,bars getting applications and I was like
Man069_Man070_0790,on a cleanse or like not drinking that
Man069_Man070_0791,weekend we have to go to Sunday beer bus
Man069_Man070_0792,I have to look for the manager okay
Man069_Man070_0793,fucking cleanse this weekender why am I
Man069_Man070_0794,not drinking right now
Man069_Man070_0795,could have changed sure I'll go with you
Man069_Man070_0796,but I'm glad you hustled and that's nice
Man069_Man070_0797,but I do think that you should give
Man069_Man070_0798,yourself a little bit more credit for
Man069_Man070_0799,that stuff
Man069_Man070_0800,who loves whom more I don't I don't
Man069_Man070_0801,think there's like a I mean for me I
Man069_Man070_0802,really don't think so yeah because I
Man069_Man070_0803,hear from you just as much as I like you
Man069_Man070_0804,know yeah I like send you things or talk
Man069_Man070_0805,to you and plan things and do stuff like
Man069_Man070_0806,I get just as much stuff back from you
Man069_Man070_0807,as I feel like I put out so if it were
Man069_Man070_0808,like you know I was constantly texting
Man069_Man070_0809,you or seeing if you wanted to do stuff
Man069_Man070_0810,then I would clearly say I do but I
Man069_Man070_0811,don't I get lots of stuff from you so I
Man069_Man070_0812,don't know I feel loved yeah me too in
Man069_Man070_0813,this time definitely it's even good
Man069_Man070_0814,point good yeah house again well what
Man069_Man070_0815,was it about a relationship that didn't
Man069_Man070_0816,work what didn't work was me and at the
Man069_Man070_0817,time like you know I'm not gonna lie it
Man069_Man070_0818,was hard to think about dating someone
Man069_Man070_0819,who lived farther away like you know you
Man069_Man070_0820,lived quite a bit away our lives were
Man069_Man070_0821,really different is when I got to know
Man069_Man070_0822,you as well and for me that was
Man069_Man070_0823,different because I was used to having a
Man069_Man070_0824,boyfriend who had his own place who I
Man069_Man070_0825,could go and I mean my relationship with
Man069_Man070_0826,him was three years and it was
Man069_Man070_0827,constantly like spending the night at
Man069_Man070_0828,each others house like all the time we
Man069_Man070_0829,had that relationship where it was like
Man069_Man070_0830,five nights six nights a week and we
Man069_Man070_0831,didn't really sleep apart unless we were
Man069_Man070_0832,mad at each other or something so I was
Man069_Man070_0833,used to that and that was really hard to
Man069_Man070_0834,think about like getting into a
Man069_Man070_0835,relationship with somebody who lives at
Man069_Man070_0836,home you know works like I hate to say
Man069_Man070_0837,like you had like a suburban type type
Man069_Man070_0838,of life but like you kind of did in the
Man069_Man070_0839,way where you you lived farther out and
Man069_Man070_0840,then you worked in Pasadena so it was
Man069_Man070_0841,you know that type of lifestyle we have
Man069_Man070_0842,to take advantage of like when you're
Man069_Man070_0843,here and I just
Man069_Man070_0844,I wasn't used to that and I wasn't ready
Man069_Man070_0845,for that and not to say that that was
Man069_Man070_0846,the kicker cuz that wasn't the kicker
Man069_Man070_0847,that was just something that I had to
Man069_Man070_0848,think about in process and I had to ask
Man069_Man070_0849,myself if I was okay with those types of
Man069_Man070_0850,things
Man069_Man070_0851,but ultimately it was me I mean I was
Man069_Man070_0852,still pretty fucked up and just in a
Man069_Man070_0853,weird place and in a place where I was
Man069_Man070_0854,like wanting to try and you know
Man069_Man070_0855,obviously really attracted to you and
Man069_Man070_0856,all those types of things but I just I
Man069_Man070_0857,wasn't ready for it yeah so I mean that
Man069_Man070_0858,more than anything
Man069_Man070_0859,dynamic wise yes it was different but as
Man069_Man070_0860,far as all the things that you're like
Man069_Man070_0861,willing to put into it and I'll like
Man069_Man070_0862,what was there it was it was good you
Man069_Man070_0863,know oh it is really taking turns oh
Man069_Man070_0864,[Laughter]
Man069_Man070_0865,this is funny do you think we'll ever
Man069_Man070_0866,get back together why or why not
Man069_Man070_0867,I don't think we'll ever get back
Man069_Man070_0868,together really no I'm just kidding okay
Man069_Man070_0869,yeah I think why not
Man069_Man070_0870,we're just at such a strong platonic
Man069_Man070_0871,friendship now that I couldn't see that
Man069_Man070_0872,changing even though I'm like drunk
Man069_Man070_0873,nights I don't see us ever like
Man069_Man070_0874,stumbling in bed with each other and
Man069_Man070_0875,yeah wait you know they'd be like huh
Man069_Man070_0876,well that happens yeah not that I'm not
Man069_Man070_0877,physically attracted to you I think
Man069_Man070_0878,you're very attractive
Man069_Man070_0879,yes just now that the bond that we hold
Man069_Man070_0880,within one another just doesn't allow
Man069_Man070_0881,that yeah in a sense that's good I mean
Man069_Man070_0882,I guess he is doing like group stuff
Man069_Man070_0883,[Laughter]
Man069_Man070_0884,definitely not what it makes the
Man069_Man070_0885,relation
Man069_Man070_0886,[Laughter]
Man069_Man070_0887,that now I can't see it anything
Man069_Man070_0888,physically going down and I feel like
Man069_Man070_0889,okay that part needs to be there yeah
Man069_Man070_0890,for a relationship to build yeah cuz I
Man069_Man070_0891,think if we started going down that road
Man069_Man070_0892,or if we went down that road then it
Man069_Man070_0893,would I mean for me like yeah I sort of
Man069_Man070_0894,I feel the same way I think that if we I
Man069_Man070_0895,think if it happened once it might not
Man069_Man070_0896,make things weird but I think if it
Man069_Man070_0897,happened or it kept happening it would
Man069_Man070_0898,definitely cause a lot of problems and
Man069_Man070_0899,for me I'm so happy with everything's
Man069_Man070_0900,that it's worth it to stay out of that
Man069_Man070_0901,yeah yeah I think I wouldn't want to
Man069_Man070_0902,mess anything up yeah okay oh my gosh
Man069_Man070_0903,even remember do you believe that I was
Man069_Man070_0904,emotionally present in our relationship
Man069_Man070_0905,and am I now I definitely think that you
Man069_Man070_0906,were I think that you're more so now but
Man069_Man070_0907,I think we're also older and wiser and I
Man069_Man070_0908,think that we've learned a lot like both
Man069_Man070_0909,from each other and from our life
Man069_Man070_0910,experiences that we've had I think
Man069_Man070_0911,there's a lot that's changed in both our
Man069_Man070_0912,lives in the past like three years yeah
Man069_Man070_0913,the has made a big difference so I feel
Man069_Man070_0914,like I want to say that you're more
Man069_Man070_0915,present now but I think you were really
Man069_Man070_0916,attentive and really present then you
Man069_Man070_0917,made a big effort and you were always
Man069_Man070_0918,there I never felt like I was like
Man069_Man070_0919,waiting around on you or wishing or any
Man069_Man070_0920,of those types of things from you at the
Man069_Man070_0921,time I think it's just the progression
Man069_Man070_0922,that makes me want to say that more so
Man069_Man070_0923,now yeah but it's also grown into a lot
Man069_Man070_0924,more sure so yeah it's kind of different
Man069_Man070_0925,now I guess
Man069_Man070_0926,what did I give you that none of your
Man069_Man070_0927,other partners did one of the best
Man069_Man070_0928,friendships I could have asked for I
Man069_Man070_0929,haven't I want to consider many being an
Man069_Man070_0930,ex-boyfriend mm-hmm and I feel like even
Man069_Man070_0931,our relationship was so small I don't
Man069_Man070_0932,know if that would have been considered
Man069_Man070_0933,but our relationship wise I feel like
Man069_Man070_0934,you've given me that and it's probably
Man069_Man070_0935,one of the best gifts I feel like anyone
Man069_Man070_0936,could give anyone else yeah and that is
Man069_Man070_0937,like a true friendship that I feel like
Man069_Man070_0938,we'll grow old together and enjoy that
Man069_Man070_0939,and so for me I totally see that
Man069_Man070_0940,getting brunch all the time my partner
Man069_Man070_0941,is there like all hanging out yes like
Man069_Man070_0942,enjoying life and being outdoors all the
Man069_Man070_0943,time and I feel like with others that
Man069_Man070_0944,wouldn't it's not even a thought in my
Man069_Man070_0945,head yeah but with you yeah good yeah
Man069_Man070_0946,it's probably the best thing mm-hmm do
Man069_Man070_0947,you regret the way things ended I don't
Man069_Man070_0948,ever like to say that I regrets any I
Man069_Man070_0949,don't like to say that I regret anything
Man069_Man070_0950,I think things happen and I think now
Man069_Man070_0951,how things have turned out it maybe was
Man069_Man070_0952,good hearing from what you've said not
Man069_Man070_0953,just today but like before when you said
Man069_Man070_0954,the way that things happened made me do
Man069_Man070_0955,this this and this and I sometimes think
Man069_Man070_0956,like our friendship might not be the
Man069_Man070_0957,same if things happen differently yeah
Man069_Man070_0958,so I don't personally I just have that
Man069_Man070_0959,like sort of life belief that I don't
Man069_Man070_0960,like to mess with things like I don't
Man069_Man070_0961,like to wish that I would change certain
Man069_Man070_0962,things like that even though I do
Man069_Man070_0963,question a lot of decisions like I said
Man069_Man070_0964,or like wonder if the grass is greener
Man069_Man070_0965,on the other side I don't look back at
Man069_Man070_0966,that type of decision and wish that I
Man069_Man070_0967,could change it yeah I mean I'm sure I
Man069_Man070_0968,could have been a lot nicer I could have
Man069_Man070_0969,been more vocal and more upfront and
Man069_Man070_0970,handled things differently and obviously
Man069_Man070_0971,I think that's always something that can
Man069_Man070_0972,be better but I learned from it and I've
Man069_Man070_0973,definitely learned from you telling me
Man069_Man070_0974,that and taking that into consideration
Man069_Man070_0975,when I've dated
Man069_Man070_0976,people or just even like talk to their
Man069_Man070_0977,guys and just try to be as I've gotten
Man069_Man070_0978,older and do those things like take all
Man069_Man070_0979,that into consideration and know like
Man069_Man070_0980,when I should be blunt and honest and
Man069_Man070_0981,also know when to just be polite and
Man069_Man070_0982,upfront I think it's helped me in quite
Man069_Man070_0983,a bit like just being able to talk to
Man069_Man070_0984,you about it because I've never had that
Man069_Man070_0985,I mean I've had that but not in the same
Man069_Man070_0986,sense where I can take someone's advice
Man069_Man070_0987,and really like soak it up because it's
Man069_Man070_0988,coming from like a place of friendship
Man069_Man070_0989,and a place where it's like really
Man069_Man070_0990,secure in our friendship and
Man069_Man070_0991,relationship now what did you learn from
Man069_Man070_0992,our relationship that's preparing you
Man069_Man070_0993,for the next one
Man069_Man070_0994,about your mumbling I feel like it
Man069_Man070_0995,taught me to be honest my company
Man069_Man070_0996,thereon that's about like on both sides
Man069_Man070_0997,good hope for them to be honest with me
Man069_Man070_0998,about how they're feeling and me to be
Man069_Man070_0999,honest with them and it's funny like
Man069_Man070_1000,when we talk about our relationship we
Man069_Man070_1001,always say how you just weren't ready
Man069_Man070_1002,and I feel like I've met guys when I
Man069_Man070_1003,wasn't ready afterwards yeah and even to
Man069_Man070_1004,like today when I feel like I am
Man069_Man070_1005,mentally ready for a relationship mm-hmm
Man069_Man070_1006,sometimes I'm not
Man069_Man070_1007,yawns even if I'm dating a great guy I
Man069_Man070_1008,still am a little hesitant on letting
Man069_Man070_1009,them know mm-hmm knowing how much it
Man069_Man070_1010,hurts at the end of the day to then find
Man069_Man070_1011,out weeks later yeah so do you realize
Man069_Man070_1012,that you're not ready after you were
Man069_Man070_1013,dating them or realize that when you are
Man069_Man070_1014,dating them both okay yeah and if it's
Man069_Man070_1015,Darien I tried my best to be upfront
Man069_Man070_1016,good but it's hard it's hard to tell
Man069_Man070_1017,someone like hey it's not gonna happen
Man069_Man070_1018,or hey this is not working because of a
Man069_Man070_1019,B and C well you always come across
Man069_Man070_1020,looking a little bit like a jerk when
Man069_Man070_1021,you just especially via text because
Man069_Man070_1022,everything is text but you're like hey
Man069_Man070_1023,why were you honest but
Man069_Man070_1024,at the end of the day it's like why do
Man069_Man070_1025,they have to tell me that yeah uh it's
Man069_Man070_1026,catch-22 I guess yeah what do you most
Man069_Man070_1027,admire about me um I most admire like
Man069_Man070_1028,your warm romantic outlook it's really
Man069_Man070_1029,really nice it's really unusual too
Man069_Man070_1030,because I it's something that I wish
Man069_Man070_1031,that I could find in a guy like that I
Man069_Man070_1032,want to eventually you spend my life
Man069_Man070_1033,with and it's nice to have friends like
Man069_Man070_1034,that just because I think again like you
Man069_Man070_1035,understand me I understand where I'm
Man069_Man070_1036,coming from a lot of times and it's nice
Man069_Man070_1037,that you know when we talk about like oh
Man069_Man070_1038,like where you gonna take this guy or
Man069_Man070_1039,like what are you gonna do on this date
Man069_Man070_1040,and stuff like a lot of the things we
Man069_Man070_1041,talk about are so similar and like the
Man069_Man070_1042,things that we would like to do yeah so
Man069_Man070_1043,it's nice to bounce ideas and talk about
Man069_Man070_1044,that with somebody who gets it versus a
Man069_Man070_1045,friend who's not really romantic or not
Man069_Man070_1046,have that outlook that they don't really
Man069_Man070_1047,appreciate those things because I think
Man069_Man070_1048,even as a friendship like cooking dinner
Man069_Man070_1049,and hanging out at home and just like
Man069_Man070_1050,drinking wine and catching up you
Man069_Man070_1051,appreciate a lot of those things and I
Man069_Man070_1052,think that comes from your mentality and
Man069_Man070_1053,the way that you are and sort of that
Man069_Man070_1054,warm romantic type of guy and not other
Man069_Man070_1055,friends not all of my other friends are
Man069_Man070_1056,like that in that mentality or that
Man069_Man070_1057,sense and I mean everybody's different
Man069_Man070_1058,you appreciate everybody differently but
Man069_Man070_1059,that's just something that I love I love
Man069_Man070_1060,a lot about you
Man069_Man070_1061,that's something that we just want to
Man069_Man070_1062,ask do you have any I don't know I don't
Man069_Man070_1063,think of anything you have no because we
Man069_Man070_1064,talk so horribly blunt and really open
Man069_Man070_1065,about stuff cuz I don't look back at
Man069_Man070_1066,like anything and like have a lot of
Man069_Man070_1067,questions per se
