Man036_Woman041_0157,about it mm-hmm you know like be
Man036_Woman041_0158,something we're not
Man036_Woman041_0159,and I think I think we're flexible and
Man036_Woman041_0160,we have fun we try new things I love
Man036_Woman041_0161,that yeah all right next
Man036_Woman041_0162,what are you bit too specific that's a
Man036_Woman041_0163,good answer yeah am I the best sex you
Man036_Woman041_0164,have ever had yes yeah how you think so
Man036_Woman041_0165,I agree I say yes to that one getting
Man036_Woman041_0166,worse and you always have this like
Man036_Woman041_0167,weird feeling about that you always
Man036_Woman041_0168,think that I used to teasing you or that
Man036_Woman041_0169,I'm not I'm lying to you it's just
Man036_Woman041_0170,security you know you are because I love
Man036_Woman041_0171,you what's the biggest challenge of our
Man036_Woman041_0172,relationship
Man036_Woman041_0173,hmm that's uh that's one that I'd have
Man036_Woman041_0174,to think about but we've had several and
Man036_Woman041_0175,I think we've worked at them I think
Man036_Woman041_0176,I've been the one that has kind of given
Man036_Woman041_0177,up first and like you've been the one
Man036_Woman041_0178,that has always pushed me to knock you
Man036_Woman041_0179,up pretty much so the challenges that
Man036_Woman041_0180,we've had like the biggest challenge
Man036_Woman041_0181,that we've had I think has been for us
Man036_Woman041_0182,what do you think I think it would have
Man036_Woman041_0183,to be I think for me would have to be
Man036_Woman041_0184,like at the beginning it was patience
Man036_Woman041_0185,yeah learning how to just be patient
Man036_Woman041_0186,with the person that you are still
Man036_Woman041_0187,feeling each other I wasn't that great
Man036_Woman041_0188,in the beginning either yeah I think
Man036_Woman041_0189,that's always my biggest challenge as
Man036_Woman041_0190,patients I think I think I took a lot
Man036_Woman041_0191,for granted the beginning because you
Man036_Woman041_0192,were always coming like the distance
Man036_Woman041_0193,thing is not that big of a deal but it
Man036_Woman041_0194,somehow was like our our timing like
Man036_Woman041_0195,there was up well uh mm-hm you know you
Man036_Woman041_0196,have your home situation I'm making a
Man036_Woman041_0197,giant manchild I'm still trying to grow
Man036_Woman041_0198,up like it or am i into things
Man036_Woman041_0199,yeah and we didn't have like our little
Man036_Woman041_0200,neutral space I felt like we're always
Man036_Woman041_0201,on each other's turf and you were doing
Man036_Woman041_0202,the majority like majority of the
Man036_Woman041_0203,traveling in the beginning so that was
Man036_Woman041_0204,hard at first and in coordinating like I
Man036_Woman041_0205,think socially yeah like used to get I
Man036_Woman041_0206,mean you did you used to get annoyed
Man036_Woman041_0207,with me about that right like teeny bit
Man036_Woman041_0208,yeah I mean like what like about what's
Man036_Woman041_0209,going on yeah well you know if you take
Man036_Woman041_0210,it if you like took it too far I would
Man036_Woman041_0211,be like yeah yeah well you and I
Man036_Woman041_0212,wouldn't get upset about it if it were
Man036_Woman041_0213,it was a couple times I used to get
Man036_Woman041_0214,upset when I would be out and you would
Man036_Woman041_0215,be especially when you're studying
Man036_Woman041_0216,oh yeah cuz you're like oh you want to
Man036_Woman041_0217,go out no tip I'm studying but are you
Man036_Woman041_0218,sure hey what's up everybody the
Man036_Woman041_0219,background like yes I really wanted to
Man036_Woman041_0220,go out but I don't want to talk about
Man036_Woman041_0221,that right now cuz I'm studying
Man036_Woman041_0222,so the only reason why I would get
Man036_Woman041_0223,irritated because I was trying to keep
Man036_Woman041_0224,like you know I was trying to finish
Man036_Woman041_0225,something I had a goal and I needed to
Man036_Woman041_0226,concentrate on it and I felt like you
Man036_Woman041_0227,weren't there with me and it bothered me
Man036_Woman041_0228,it bothered me that you were like doing
Man036_Woman041_0229,your own thing when I would ask you like
Man036_Woman041_0230,you know once every week every other
Man036_Woman041_0231,weekend staying with me because I was I

Man036_Woman041_0242,like that he likes leave me with you so
Man036_Woman041_0243,okay is it me I think it's me if you
Man036_Woman041_0244,could change one thing about me what
Man036_Woman041_0245,would it be I don't know if I would
Man036_Woman041_0246,change it but it's your ability to like
Man036_Woman041_0247,switch off mm-hmm but maybe that's a
Man036_Woman041_0248,good thing it's called flat affect I've
Man036_Woman041_0249,learned about it because it's so it's a
Man036_Woman041_0250,college party like to be and he did
Man036_Woman041_0251,debate with you or like it for our
Man036_Woman041_0252,passions are high and then you have this
Man036_Woman041_0253,ability to just turn off yeah and walk
Man036_Woman041_0254,away and it's like and I'm left with
Man036_Woman041_0255,this like ball of emotion I don't know
Man036_Woman041_0256,where to put it I'm like where you going
Man036_Woman041_0257,and you know yeah I gotta go right now

Man036_Woman041_0260,with that with you I don't know if I
Man036_Woman041_0261,would change that though might be a
Man036_Woman041_0262,healthy thing like I just I do it as a
Man036_Woman041_0263,self-defense mechanism you know yeah
Man036_Woman041_0264,just super good at it hey learn how to
Man036_Woman041_0265,do it start doing that at seven you get
Man036_Woman041_0266,pretty good at it yeah so anyways next
Man036_Woman041_0267,Oh what about you what would I change
Man036_Woman041_0268,about you I would change like your your
Man036_Woman041_0269,way of just sometimes being so I had
Man036_Woman041_0270,the word just like not instinct sure

Man036_Woman041_0278,sometimes like what I wish I could like
Man036_Woman041_0279,change like your ability to like handle
Man036_Woman041_0280,that your ability to like say no like
Man036_Woman041_0281,you know mm-hmm and not like be so
Man036_Woman041_0282,impulsive sometimes about things because
Man036_Woman041_0283,I think it'll be it's like there's like
Man036_Woman041_0284,a healthy limit you know yeah it's it's
Man036_Woman041_0285,driven a few people crazy in my mind
Man036_Woman041_0286,yeah I can see that I'm working on that
Man036_Woman041_0287,that's pretty much it
Man036_Woman041_0288,what is the sexual fantasy you were
Man036_Woman041_0289,afraid to ask me nothing yeah there was
Man036_Woman041_0290,no I don't have anything that I haven't
Man036_Woman041_0291,told you about myself what I want is
Man036_Woman041_0292,this one thing I know there's really dot
Man036_Woman041_0293,I think we're pretty pretty honest in
Man036_Woman041_0294,that department okay cool we would have
Man036_Woman041_0295,an exit yeah
Man036_Woman041_0296,what's a compromise you've made that
Man036_Woman041_0297,I've failed to recognize
Man036_Woman041_0298,[Music]
Man036_Woman041_0299,be honest I'm thinking I don't I mean
Man036_Woman041_0300,that the sometimes in the beginning I
Man036_Woman041_0301,think you didn't recognize what I was
Man036_Woman041_0302,trying to compromise but I think that
Man036_Woman041_0303,was like because it's like too late
Man036_Woman041_0304,because like you we were already upset
Man036_Woman041_0305,yeah yes so it's like irrelevant I've
Man036_Woman041_0306,done that last week yeah so I don't know
Man036_Woman041_0307,I think we acknowledge each other's
Man036_Woman041_0308,compromises pretty well lately too
Man036_Woman041_0309,I think I've just been trying a little
Man036_Woman041_0310,harder to be attentive to that stuff and
Man036_Woman041_0311,you've acknowledged it once Thanks
Man036_Woman041_0312,mm-hmm what about you so you'd ask me
Man036_Woman041_0313,the question anything I haven't
Man036_Woman041_0314,acknowledged the your compromises no no
Man036_Woman041_0315,I don't think so I think in the past
Man036_Woman041_0316,yeah but I got pissed and you're like
Man036_Woman041_0317,okay we figured it out you know yeah
Man036_Woman041_0318,when was the last time you questioned
Man036_Woman041_0319,ending a relationship and why didn't you
Man036_Woman041_0320,like a couple months ago yeah yeah yeah
Man036_Woman041_0321,why didn't I because I love you and you
Man036_Woman041_0322,always convinced me that this is worth
Man036_Woman041_0323,it I don't we can make whatever it is a
Man036_Woman041_0324,situation that we're going to work out
Man036_Woman041_0325,like and then you also convinced me that
Man036_Woman041_0326,you're gonna change whatever it is that
Man036_Woman041_0327,bothers pacifically that maybe were were
Man036_Woman041_0328,we what brought us to that point you
Man036_Woman041_0329,were angry you were hungry angry it was
Man036_Woman041_0330,no but you weren't thinking about ending
Man036_Woman041_0331,no no that wasn't an ender it was just a
Man036_Woman041_0332,fight yeah we didn't really even fight
Man036_Woman041_0333,no it wasn't a fight it was just me
Man036_Woman041_0334,being hungry
Man036_Woman041_0335,grumpy wanting to go and find food
Man036_Woman041_0336,that's not doing so I don't know I can't
Man036_Woman041_0337,remember what you were so angry about I
Man036_Woman041_0338,think we owe wrong I think kind of
Man036_Woman041_0339,everything hit it once like you leaving
Man036_Woman041_0340,and mother day was bad that day and I
Man036_Woman041_0341,think we had miscommunicated on
Man036_Woman041_0342,something yeah I think the reason why I
Man036_Woman041_0343,thought of it and I remember was because
Man036_Woman041_0344,I was leaving and then I was like you
Man036_Woman041_0345,know like why continue like a
Man036_Woman041_0346,relationships out in three months won't
Man036_Woman041_0347,be here and like I was thinking for a
Man036_Woman041_0348,while like it would be easier to just
Man036_Woman041_0349,like and things before like leaving
Man036_Woman041_0350,because it could like give me like a
Man036_Woman041_0351,like closure with you like an ability in
Man036_Woman041_0352,it just like yeah like you know not to
Man036_Woman041_0353,go with you not like be with you all the
Man036_Woman041_0354,time before I left to kind of like get
Man036_Woman041_0355,used to it you know yeah but then you
Man036_Woman041_0356,were like you know like it doesn't make
Man036_Woman041_0357,sense we might as well enjoy like the
Man036_Woman041_0358,rest of what we have together and not
Man036_Woman041_0359,make sense and that's why that was the
Man036_Woman041_0360,last time I thought of breaking up with
Man036_Woman041_0361,you was when I realized I wasn't gonna
Man036_Woman041_0362,be here yeah I'm glad we stuck it out
Man036_Woman041_0363,yeah me too good years what do you love
Man036_Woman041_0364,about my family and what do you wish you

Man036_Woman041_0367,well I love how your mom's kind of like
Man036_Woman041_0368,old-school but super on top of her game
Man036_Woman041_0369,like she I really respect the fact that
Man036_Woman041_0370,she has done everything she's done like
Man036_Woman041_0371,medical school teaching while your dad
Man036_Woman041_0372,is like not been there like I mean I
Man036_Woman041_0373,wish you guys were like more of a family

Man036_Woman041_0379,mother had more distractions in her life
Man036_Woman041_0380,didn't have to focus so much on on you
Man036_Woman041_0381,in by distraction I mean a boyfriend
Man036_Woman041_0382,me too yeah but no I I think she's been
Man036_Woman041_0383,very welcoming at first like I thought I
Man036_Woman041_0384,was being really judged by your mother
Man036_Woman041_0385,is usually how she comes off yeah it's
Man036_Woman041_0386,like a self it's like a defense
Man036_Woman041_0387,mechanism
Man036_Woman041_0388,my brother compared it to like the New
Man036_Woman041_0389,York way like The New Yorker because
Man036_Woman041_0390,it's like she has this front you know
Man036_Woman041_0391,but she really is so inside she's just

Man036_Woman041_0394,she has this front and she wants to make
Man036_Woman041_0395,sure that she has this friend cuz she's

Man036_Woman041_0414,you guys don't talk to each other for
Man036_Woman041_0415,whatever time every time I get together
Man036_Woman041_0416,with the family with your family I feel
Man036_Woman041_0417,so loved you guys love so much and
Man036_Woman041_0418,that's what I love about your family and
Man036_Woman041_0419,what do I wish I could change about them
Man036_Woman041_0420,just like your father and like
Man036_Woman041_0421,everything he's made your mom go through
Man036_Woman041_0422,like I wish he would would have would
Man036_Woman041_0423,would have like stepped up you know at
Man036_Woman041_0424,an earlier time for your mom because I
Man036_Woman041_0425,see that your mom suffers a lot because
Man036_Woman041_0426,of what he's done and that's all I would
Man036_Woman041_0427,change so your turn that's funny I never
Man036_Woman041_0428,noticed the difference between the Cuban
Man036_Woman041_0429,and the Greenville families like we
Man036_Woman041_0430,don't all stay together forever we leave
Man036_Woman041_0431,early
Man036_Woman041_0432,yeah maybe that I don't know maybe that
Man036_Woman041_0433,space is a different that's a different
Man036_Woman041_0434,conversation that works what is a
Man036_Woman041_0435,mistake you see me make repetitively
Man036_Woman041_0436,repeatedly why do you think I keep
Man036_Woman041_0437,making it so what is a mistake you see
Man036_Woman041_0438,what is a mistake you see me make
Man036_Woman041_0439,repeatedly yeah why do you think I keep
Man036_Woman041_0440,making it well I think like now you
Man036_Woman041_0441,you're doing much better because you've
Man036_Woman041_0442,realized that you do have to change
Man036_Woman041_0443,certain things and certain habits in
Man036_Woman041_0444,your life to become a grown up man to
Man036_Woman041_0445,become responsible and to just get your
Man036_Woman041_0446,stuff together but I am a mistake that I
Man036_Woman041_0447,see you like commit all the time is um I
Man036_Woman041_0448,think it would be like I don't know I
Man036_Woman041_0449,would probably be like your maybe your
Man036_Woman041_0450,procrastination for things sometimes and
Man036_Woman041_0451,your ability like like your I don't know
Man036_Woman041_0452,I guess because you've changed so much
Man036_Woman041_0453,in these last three months like you're
Man036_Woman041_0454,not the person that you were before and
Man036_Woman041_0455,like you're not making the same mistakes
Man036_Woman041_0456,that you do that you used to make before
Man036_Woman041_0457,so this question wouldn't really be
Man036_Woman041_0458,relevant to you right now because I
Man036_Woman041_0459,think that it was you kind of stopped
Man036_Woman041_0460,making all these mistakes oh yeah the
Man036_Woman041_0461,car that's it
Man036_Woman041_0462,the car just waiting till the last
Man036_Woman041_0463,minute to do things like procrastinating
Man036_Woman041_0464,on things
Man036_Woman041_0465,I forgot I thought you were getting your
Man036_Woman041_0466,shit together well the car drove done
Man036_Woman041_0467,but you know
Man036_Woman041_0468,yeah just like waiting till the last
Man036_Woman041_0469,minute to do things and like
Man036_Woman041_0470,procrastinating on like your
Man036_Woman041_0471,responsibilities you know yeah it's a
Man036_Woman041_0472,big one and just you know having like
Man036_Woman041_0473,the ability to say okay you know just
Man036_Woman041_0474,prioritize prioritize I think you need
Man036_Woman041_0475,to just sometimes I think you make that
Man036_Woman041_0476,mistake of not realizing what it is that
Man036_Woman041_0477,you need to do over what it is that you
Man036_Woman041_0478,want to do
Man036_Woman041_0479,and then what's the other part and why
Man036_Woman041_0480,do you anyway why do you think I keep
Man036_Woman041_0481,making it why do I think you keep making
Man036_Woman041_0482,it just because I think sometimes you
Man036_Woman041_0483,just get you just got cluttered and
Man036_Woman041_0484,you're just like oh I'm just gonna do
Man036_Woman041_0485,you know it goes back to like what we
Man036_Woman041_0486,were talking about like you being what's
Man036_Woman041_0487,that word again I always forget it
Man036_Woman041_0488,pulses impulsive yeah yeah working on
Man036_Woman041_0489,that mm-hmm we all are working on that
Man036_Woman041_0490,so let's take that I keep committing
Man036_Woman041_0491,what kind of mistakes do you keep making
Man036_Woman041_0492,I'd say in the beginning you like spoke
Man036_Woman041_0493,without thinking quite a bit like we'd
Man036_Woman041_0494,be in social situations and you just say
Man036_Woman041_0495,something and they would be like oh
Man036_Woman041_0496,you're like what but I'm like I love you
Man036_Woman041_0497,you know but I never noticed that I know
Man036_Woman041_0498,but you I haven't it's that's part of
Man036_Woman041_0499,the reason I looked at me like that no I
Man036_Woman041_0500,just want to know it's not that I love
Man036_Woman041_0501,that part of you but that you've been a
Man036_Woman041_0502,little more I guess aware sometimes
Man036_Woman041_0503,before saying something right off the
Man036_Woman041_0504,top of your head yeah you know and like
Man036_Woman041_0505,people have told me that before and I've
Man036_Woman041_0506,like it's almost like an instinct for me
Man036_Woman041_0507,it was for for a very long time but they
Man036_Woman041_0508,go time in between what goes here and
Man036_Woman041_0509,what comes out of here like I mean I do
Man036_Woman041_0510,think about it
Man036_Woman041_0511,I actually do think about it and I just
Man036_Woman041_0512,say it anyways even though it's what I
Man036_Woman041_0513,just felt in my gut I think about it and
Man036_Woman041_0514,then I'm like who gives a fuck and then
Man036_Woman041_0515,I say it anyway so that's what I want to
Man036_Woman041_0516,say and sometimes I'm that way because
Man036_Woman041_0517,of the environment that I grew up in
Man036_Woman041_0518,we're at guys art opening and you were
Man036_Woman041_0519,like yeah and I'm like right in front of
Man036_Woman041_0520,the artists like I guess like the part
Man036_Woman041_0521,of me that I grew up with like a mother
Man036_Woman041_0522,that was always very not critical but
Man036_Woman041_0523,very realistic and very like say which
Man036_Woman041_0524,like she just says what she feels and
Man036_Woman041_0525,she's a
Man036_Woman041_0526,very blunt yeah and so I kind of felt
Man036_Woman041_0527,like for a lot for a for a long time
Man036_Woman041_0528,that I was that way because that's just
Man036_Woman041_0529,like pretty much what they like so I
Man036_Woman041_0530,would I grew up in and wait but that's
Man036_Woman041_0531,good that's a good part of you to
Man036_Woman041_0532,healthy balance like you said yeah of
Man036_Woman041_0533,course
Man036_Woman041_0534,why do you think I keep why why do I
Man036_Woman041_0535,think you keep making it I mean that's
Man036_Woman041_0536,just just who you are you're it's part
Man036_Woman041_0537,of your personality it's not even that
Man036_Woman041_0538,big of a mistake
Man036_Woman041_0539,it's kind of nice mine mm-hmm do you
Man036_Woman041_0540,think we'll stay together after I move
Man036_Woman041_0541,oh yeah I think it's yours
Man036_Woman041_0542,oh do you think we'll stay together
Man036_Woman041_0543,after I moved to New Orleans
Man036_Woman041_0544,um I think you know that I think you
Man036_Woman041_0545,we've talked about this before and like
Man036_Woman041_0546,you know that I'm not gonna do
Man036_Woman041_0547,long-distance visits never been
Man036_Woman041_0548,something that has worked for me before
Man036_Woman041_0549,and I just find it difficult to be with
Man036_Woman041_0550,somebody that I love when I'm like 900
Man036_Woman041_0551,miles away from them right because I
Man036_Woman041_0552,want you there so no you know that yeah
Man036_Woman041_0553,I've known that and I think like I
Man036_Woman041_0554,wanted to prolong reality long enough to
Man036_Woman041_0555,like always try to play with the notion
Man036_Woman041_0556,yeah I would some you know I've looked
Man036_Woman041_0557,at some jobs in New Orleans and I've
Man036_Woman041_0558,checked into it
Man036_Woman041_0559,yeah and obviously just wouldn't be like
Man036_Woman041_0560,the be a super romantic thing to do yeah
Man036_Woman041_0561,right now but I don't need to be super
Man036_Woman041_0562,romantic right now I am exactly they
Man036_Woman041_0563,need to grow up a little bit right now
Man036_Woman041_0564,exactly and like this is always my home
Man036_Woman041_0565,so if you're here like I'll see you when
Man036_Woman041_0566,I come and we'll always be friends and
Man036_Woman041_0567,we're all like you'll always be in my
Man036_Woman041_0568,life you know that yeah I know but it's
Man036_Woman041_0569,just that you're coming in terms of like
Man036_Woman041_0570,how the dynamic between us might change
Man036_Woman041_0571,or yeah that always makes me pretty
Man036_Woman041_0572,afraid but I guess that's life but I
Man036_Woman041_0573,know you're never gonna be gone from my
Man036_Woman041_0574,life you know I just don't know how it's
Man036_Woman041_0575,gonna pick it back up or what it'll be
Man036_Woman041_0576,like when we do or you know
Man036_Woman041_0577,that's how you just have to kind of not
Man036_Woman041_0578,over thank you leave those things up to
Man036_Woman041_0579,fate it was fate that we met so yeah I
Man036_Woman041_0580,always forget you did but I did because
Man036_Woman041_0581,it's my question oh when did I hurt you
Man036_Woman041_0582,most what was that moment I think you
Man036_Woman041_0583,know yeah I think I know too and I don't
Man036_Woman041_0584,want to say it okay so that's why we
Man036_Woman041_0585,know it's you oh wait didn't when did
Man036_Woman041_0586,you hurt me the most
Man036_Woman041_0587,I don't think you know you've been a
Man036_Woman041_0588,sweetheart you really have it not in
Man036_Woman041_0589,that way not in like a scarring way or a
Man036_Woman041_0590,jarring waver made me change the way I
Man036_Woman041_0591,think about you so no let's go on the
Man036_Woman041_0592,next question do you believe there is
Man036_Woman041_0593,the one for you
Man036_Woman041_0594,the one in general yeah like what uh I
Man036_Woman041_0595,mean like in a metaphorical or or
Man036_Woman041_0596,metaphysical or in a higher sense like
Man036_Woman041_0597,not necessarily like one I think I think
Man036_Woman041_0598,you can find love in a lot of places but
Man036_Woman041_0599,I think you can only find certain types
Man036_Woman041_0600,of love with certain types of people and
Man036_Woman041_0601,a certain one specific person
Man036_Woman041_0602,so maybe yeah I mean I think there is I
Man036_Woman041_0603,don't know no not in like the
Man036_Woman041_0604,[Music]
Man036_Woman041_0605,I don't know the stereotypical sense of
Man036_Woman041_0606,that I think is the one but I think when
Man036_Woman041_0607,you find something that you love and you
Man036_Woman041_0608,want you should like anything in life
Man036_Woman041_0609,you should go get it or you should
Man036_Woman041_0610,maintain it or you should make it grow
Man036_Woman041_0611,so yeah I could believe I believe you
Man036_Woman041_0612,can make it work with one and really
Man036_Woman041_0613,maintain and foster that relationship
Man036_Woman041_0614,and mi-8 you're right yeah right now
Man036_Woman041_0615,you're right I have my focus on you
Man036_Woman041_0616,again the dynamics gonna be hard when we
Man036_Woman041_0617,leave but I know that I've found
Man036_Woman041_0618,something that I want when I've tried
Man036_Woman041_0619,that you know and I'd be willing to
Man036_Woman041_0620,continue it and I'd be willing to to
Man036_Woman041_0621,keep it growing and keep this Jane
Man036_Woman041_0622,Foster said fostering alright well now
Man036_Woman041_0623,do I have to ask this I think we do I
Man036_Woman041_0624,believe there's the one for me well I
Man036_Woman041_0625,don't I think that can come in many many
Man036_Woman041_0626,it has like a lot of different ways of
Man036_Woman041_0627,like being perceived you know like what
Man036_Woman041_0628,is the one right and if you don't
Man036_Woman041_0629,believe it exactly so it's like I don't
Man036_Woman041_0630,know if I believe that there's like v1 I
Man036_Woman041_0631,get along with so many people and I and
Man036_Woman041_0632,I feel like I have this ability and so
Man036_Woman041_0633,do you to like love so many people and
Man036_Woman041_0634,be able to like understand love and the
Man036_Woman041_0635,way that I think I have an ability to
Man036_Woman041_0636,I guess I don't really understand that
Man036_Woman041_0637,that idea of the one because I think
Man036_Woman041_0638,when a person I don't know I don't
Man036_Woman041_0639,really know if I can find if I can
Man036_Woman041_0640,believe in that like this one person
Man036_Woman041_0641,like this one person is this person that
Man036_Woman041_0642,what does that mean the one that's
Man036_Woman041_0643,everything that you could ever want in a
Man036_Woman041_0644,person predestinate this perfect person
Man036_Woman041_0645,yeah maybe I don't know because I don't
Man036_Woman041_0646,know if I could just forever understand
Man036_Woman041_0647,I don't know being with I don't know if
Man036_Woman041_0648,I understand that the one I don't know
Man036_Woman041_0649,if I get that so you don't believe from
Man036_Woman041_0650,that I don't know if I do believe in it
Man036_Woman041_0651,or not because I up to this point I
Man036_Woman041_0652,haven't understood what that is or like
Man036_Woman041_0653,what does that mean I don't know like
Man036_Woman041_0654,what is the one I love no I don't think
Man036_Woman041_0655,so I don't believe in that or maybe the
Man036_Woman041_0656,one for you and and are you it I think
Man036_Woman041_0657,we need to like I think there's a lot
Man036_Woman041_0658,that we need to work on and there's like
Man036_Woman041_0659,the whole dynamic that I'm leaving and
Man036_Woman041_0660,the whole dynamic that you know we're
Man036_Woman041_0661,separating that makes that not a reality
Man036_Woman041_0662,right now so I don't think that I would
Man036_Woman041_0663,believe in this whole statement right
Man036_Woman041_0664,now but not because I love you any less
Man036_Woman041_0665,I love you and I see sometimes I picture
Man036_Woman041_0666,a future together but is it a reality
Man036_Woman041_0667,for us right now you know so since but
Man036_Woman041_0668,that do one thing it's kind of funny
Man036_Woman041_0669,it's like the Cinderella thing I guess
Man036_Woman041_0670,this is you why do you love me why do I
Man036_Woman041_0671,love you why do I love you I think
Man036_Woman041_0672,because of how like genuine you are and
Man036_Woman041_0673,everything you do like from the way you
Man036_Woman041_0674,walk to the way you eat or the way you
Man036_Woman041_0675,sing like all just you you're just very
Man036_Woman041_0676,and you are a lovely person and you're
Man036_Woman041_0677,so honest and you're so forgiving and
Man036_Woman041_0678,you're funny and you're silly and you're
Man036_Woman041_0679,a huge dork but then you're also very
Man036_Woman041_0680,elegant so you don't really really
Man036_Woman041_0681,belong in one category so it's like I
Man036_Woman041_0682,get my a TD gets a little piece of

Man036_Woman041_0731,like perspective on it because I didn't
Man036_Woman041_0732,know that other people went that way
Man036_Woman041_0733,until today when I realized that you
Man036_Woman041_0734,know they the producers and the

Man036_Woman041_0745,I really love that into like not just
Man036_Woman041_0746,say immediately because I maybe I've
Man036_Woman041_0747,learned to like protect my word a little
