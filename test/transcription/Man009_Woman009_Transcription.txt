Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0011,mind first that's not the first thing I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0012,remember it I would not have probably
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0013,thought of that I don't know what my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0014,answer would have I don't know I would
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0015,have been awkward it was all awkward it

Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0025,the I don't know so far it's just been
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0026,the ease of it more than anything
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0027,because it seems like other people I've
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0028,been with and other people you date over
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0029,the course of your life it's just kind
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0030,of like so much goddamn work yeah like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0031,you know and you don't feel like you can
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0032,be yourself and you don't feel like you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0033,know you kind of feel like you have to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0034,play a game a little bit and I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0035,feel like I'm necessarily playing games
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0036,unless I'm playing games but then it's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0037,kind of been put out there like we're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0038,just fucking around right now yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0039,oh when do you feel closest to me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0040,they're closest to me when do we feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0041,close when do you feel closest this is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0042,really weird too but I feel like when I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0043,do something like work out and tell you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0044,about it or have a hard day and tell you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0045,about it cuz there's no one else in my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0046,life like I talked about my mom and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0047,mm-hmm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0048,I talk about my family I talk about okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0049,trips and all that with my friends but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0050,you're the only one I talk about like my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0051,name I had a hard workout so stupid no
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0052,but do you feel close to me when you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0053,tell me about it do you feel close to me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0054,when we're going through it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0055,no and I'm telling you about it like I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0056,find myself wanting to call you and tell
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0057,you about it and then I afterward I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0058,think okay that was I think that's when
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0059,I started knowing that it was like oh
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0060,this might be when you could complain to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0061,me about your day okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0062,no I agreed agreed no it's good I mean
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0063,no they've been right now I feel really
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0064,close to you right yeah we have the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0065,table looks fine it's like a jailhouse I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0066,feel like I've done something well we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0067,should have like a should be on the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0068,phone yeah oh I'm sorry I think right
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0069,yeah hmm ooh you ready for this
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0070,I guess what are you hesitant to tell me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0071,what am i hesitant to tell you right now
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0072,or ever ever I'm gonna go ahead and make
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0073,that call hmm I don't know it's always
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0074,difficult to tell you difficult if not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0075,impossible to tell you if something that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0076,you've done has bothered me like what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0077,that might be me it might not be you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0078,everything might be my perception of you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0079,I can't think of one right off the top
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0080,of my dresser a little bit a little bit
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0081,let's be honest this is all about
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0082,honesty I think that sometimes you'll do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0083,something and I'll be like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0084,oh I don't agree with that but it's not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0085,worth it for me to have that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0086,conversation because it's usually not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0087,anything big it's usually not anything
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0088,that I need to have a conversation about
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0089,it's like usually slept like shouldn't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0090,just let that go kid is it my only child
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0091,maybe maybe I don't want to analyze you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0092,but yeah but and then it could just be
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0093,me it could be my perception of whatever
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0094,it is and maybe I'm the wrong one and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0095,then I don't want to have that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0096,conversation either you know because
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0097,maybe I'm overreacting okay that's it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0098,make sense huh okay good we're not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0099,giving him surprises out here this is a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0100,oh and leading into that tell me about
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0101,the time I disappointed you and how do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0102,you feel about it now as if there were
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0103,just one time I don't actually I have to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0104,be really on it mm-hmm this is a little
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0105,deep preaching like we're the only ones
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0106,here okay I think I've been disappointed
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0107,by so many people in my life but the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0108,fact that you have so rarely like is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0109,huge it makes me feel even more trusting
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0110,of you so I know that's not the answer
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0111,to the question but I'm gonna lead with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0112,that having said that I think the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0113,disappointment that I've ever felt with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0114,you I've ever I think I've expressed
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0115,like and it's always really stupid stuff
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0116,right well I can't agree to that right
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0117,sure at the moment it's the most simple
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0118,well no like I've had a really long day
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0119,of making decisions which we obviously
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0120,talked about and I just want you to pick
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0121,where you go to dinner and the answer is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0122,no I know that's so stupid but that's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0123,the biggest disappointment you've caused
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0124,okay don't feel very disappointed with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0125,you in general I'll take it we're not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0126,very far I mean nine months then I guess
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0127,you have a little you have time but time
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0128,I can make so many more mistakes thank
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0129,you thank you yeah okay I'll pick where
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0130,we're gonna
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0131,I know it is but it is it was ooh
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0132,do we have enough sex enough sex is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0133,there ever an upset um I don't feel like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0134,I'm missing out I don't know but I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0135,feel like I'm missing out on anything
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0136,there there aren't necessarily times
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0137,where I'm like damn it if only we had
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0138,had sex I think that you know and taking
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0139,the long view there's gonna be plenty of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0140,opportunity for me to screw up and for
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0141,us to have sex for me to screw up - Wow
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0142,and for you to have sex and for me to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0143,say no to sex I've never done you're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0144,allowed to though you're allowed to do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0145,that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0146,it sounds some patriarchal thing where
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0147,it's like it could be better romance now
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0148,what could be sometimes I know that's a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0149,bit let's see that's a mixed message I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0150,know I don't know sometimes you you know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0151,I'm expected to take the lead ie picking
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0152,where we eat for dinner but sometimes
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0153,you might not want to have chicken and I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0154,thanks their dinner both there were two
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0155,tandem questions but yeah I think I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0156,fine with the amount of sex that I have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0157,I mean there could be more there could
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0158,be less I I'm not dissatisfied in any
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0159,regard okay yeah okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0160,it's all very good on that note that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0161,abundantly clear all is well enough Oh
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0162,am I the best sex you've ever had I have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0163,to be honest and say yes well we talked
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0164,about it before yeah no agree yes yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0165,thanks listen I don't even feel like I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0166,have to speak further about it because
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0167,there's like no comparison I do think
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0168,it's the connection which this is gonna
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0169,look away two years ago
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0170,I know forever somewhere joy two years
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0171,ago would have been like all the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0172,connection has nothing to do with this
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0173,but I think you've proven that wrong
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0174,yeah yeah well it's not just me you are
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0175,a part of it I know yeah a large part
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0176,some would say more than 13% well some
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0177,nights it no
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0178,just kidding sure we thought you could
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0179,we keep going I was just you know 6040
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0180,you have to be honest for this okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0181,where do you think I may fail you I know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0182,it's a hard one to deal with because
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0183,I've never thought about that I've only
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0184,thought of where I would screw up my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0185,anxiety is more from like where I would
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0186,screw up rather than where you would
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0187,screw up I don't know a guy okay I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0188,gonna have an add to it so I don't know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0189,are we allowed to add cheese yeah well
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0190,take you go ahead like without comparing
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0191,me like specifically like in the past
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0192,what didn't work that maybe you're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0193,worried might not work again it just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0194,goes back to me I bet I think at some
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0195,point you're gonna you know maybe you're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0196,gonna get sick having me around all the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0197,time I don't know so I cannot fail um
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0198,you know you could be mean to people you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0199,know you could be not welcoming to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0200,friends and whatever but so far you've
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0201,been good okay I don't I can't think of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0202,I mean
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0203,fail is such a deep like you have failed
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0204,me is so I mean disappointed but I can't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0205,even think of a time where you've
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0206,disappointed me necessarily but fail you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0207,you know I feel like if I had some
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0208,illness you would stick around I feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0209,like if there was some catastrophe or
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0210,some you know economic upheaval that you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0211,would be okay or at least we'd find a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0212,way I feel like we just find a way to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0213,work things out okay yeah where things
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0214,would just work out because I feel like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0215,so far in the nine months or however
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0216,long it's been it's like things have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0217,pretty much fallen into place I feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0218,like I haven't really again it goes back
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0219,to not having to work all that hard yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0220,I feel like powerful forces have come to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0221,my aid you know so yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0222,as weird as that sounds how do I take
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0223,you for granted I actually don't think
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0224,you do you do a really good job of not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0225,taking me for granted
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0226,okay I think I don't know dumb but again
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0227,it could be that it hasn't I don't know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0228,I don't feel taken for granted ever well
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0229,what if like you know like what about
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0230,not responding to your friends emails is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0231,that me take you for granted is that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0232,taking in a relationship for granted I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0233,think that believe me I'm not fishing
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0234,for things I think that's taking their
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0235,comfort and like like their comfort with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0236,you and they're your likability to them
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0237,for grant I don't think it has to do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0238,with me I think that's part of I think
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0239,that's been my problem if you if they
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0240,took the time to reach out to you and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0241,invite you to third party I've always
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0242,been under the assumption that they just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0243,assumed that if you were going that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0244,was going to go to right and but they
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0245,didn't say joy plus wine which they have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0246,right but now they know I get it I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0247,saying that it might be an example yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0248,me for maybe taking them for you know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0249,maybe I did taking me for granted or
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0250,taking us for granted there's such a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0251,thing as taking yeah you take it for
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0252,granted that I'm whither thou goest
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0253,cause die you have to remember they knew
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0254,me first thing go way longer right and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0255,you were miserable horribly miserably
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0256,that's the story I've saved your life
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0257,I'm apparently sliced bread I know are
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0258,you okay with me sleeping with other
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0259,people no I mean other you've slept with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0260,other people before me but and I'm you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0261,know God knows we've both been around
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0262,the bend but not now well we had this
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0263,conversation that it wasn't what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0264,I don't necessarily believe that we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0265,agreed with the monogamy thing yeah I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0266,have to say I mean that I think that's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0267,the way you have to do it I mean I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0268,want to sound judgmental but you know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0269,like I feel like if you're more that you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0270,do it with me someone's having a problem
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0271,I think if there's a three thing going
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0272,on it's there's always one person who's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0273,getting these three in the bed
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0274,whatever yeah not three together but I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0275,saying anytime you bring somebody else
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0276,in to like a couple I think it's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0277,somebody out of those three people is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0278,getting not what they're not being
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0279,served it I just feel like if I'm one of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0280,the three it's not gonna work I can't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0281,say that for other people I feel like I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0282,can I feel like I can say that if there
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0283,are three people that are in a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0284,relationship and even though they've
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0285,discussed it yeah and said this is what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0286,we're gonna do and we can make this work
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0287,I think some of the one that one person
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0288,of that three isn't being honest with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0289,the other two or somebody's disappointed
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0290,so this is a conversation I'm gonna add
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0291,to this chair so what if something like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0292,happens like like we were talking about
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0293,last night if you've been to the Amazon
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0294,it's a true thing I just read a book but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0295,it was a David Beckham had to get like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0296,extra insurance cuz he was going to the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0297,Amazon and there's microscopic fish that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0298,will fly up yours yeah and oh you either
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0299,die or they came to me right being alike
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0300,to me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0301,whatever it's called I don't ever want
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0302,to hear those words okay that's not a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0303,choice I don't want that to be a choice
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0304,I all I said was I'm afraid to go to the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0305,Amazon for that reason but you're saying
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0306,if that were to happen and you were to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0307,find some solace sexually elsewhere I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0308,don't know that's a weird situation and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0309,I can't imagine that I would but cuz
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0310,it's not like you know I could do it I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0311,mean you know it's just a weird creepy
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0312,thing yeah okay well I don't want to so
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0313,I think we're good but all right well we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0314,could talk about it just know that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0315,don't think that you know I also wonder
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0316,like if somebody gets into a situation
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0317,with like so
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0318,he was married that's like have you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0319,never seen a television show or read a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0320,book or seen a movie it never it never
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0321,works out the Shonda Rhimes Oh what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0322,would you do if I cheated on you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0323,assuming it's already been done what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0324,would I do I think that's all for me for
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0325,me okay go ahead for me I think it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0326,depends on is it an emotional thing is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0327,it just a physical
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0328,I know I know roll your eyes I I really
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0329,do like if you're absolutely madly in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0330,love with somebody that you have to have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0331,sex with them and but you don't want to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0332,lose me I think that's unfair and I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0333,would end it I think if you went on a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0334,business trip and had too much to drink
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0335,and screwed up I'd be pissed right I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0336,wouldn't want you going on a business
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0337,trip with said woman or man again but I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0338,don't know I don't I I guess I don't put
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0339,that much stock in the physical cheating
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0340,so if that's what it means then okay but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0341,don't do it let's not try it I wouldn't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0342,know I don't believe okay I'm okay with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0343,not doing it I you know point taken what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0344,is missing from our relationship missing
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0345,I feel like we've only just gotten
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0346,gotten started I think we're still in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0347,there like not the honeymoon phase
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0348,because it's silly but like I think I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0349,know it's easy to say I don't feel like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0350,I'm missing anything but I guess the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0351,only thing we're missing as a couple or
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0352,in a relationship is further experiences
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0353,that makes sense like you know you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0354,haven't live
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0355,together that would be something you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0356,know we haven't gone through like a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0357,death there's something together thank
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0358,God you know I just feel like there's if
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0359,anything's nothing's missing right now
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0360,day to day I don't feel like I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0361,feel like we don't have any trust or any
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0362,of that stuff I feel like I can't I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0363,don't know because we haven't had the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0364,whole breadth of experience yet okay I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0365,think I agree now that I need any of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0366,those experiences what do you think is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0367,the next step in our relationship
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0368,going to Mexico next week well I know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0369,you're obsessed with knowing it's gonna
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0370,happen Wow yeah I what's the next step
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0371,in our relationship I think the next
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0372,step is not tomorrow but I think the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0373,next step is do we want to move in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0374,together and we've already talked about
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0375,it and mm-hmm when is the right time and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0376,where is the right place and logistics
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0377,work I think that's the next time okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0378,it probably is yeah I don't really have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0379,a list right that's okay you always have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0380,a list but I think that might be the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0381,next thing on the list you asked that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0382,one right yeah yeah what are you scared
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0383,to tell me not hesitant that was earlier
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0384,are you scared to tell me I don't feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0385,like I have any deep dark secrets I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0386,can't think of anything that I would
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0387,would be afraid to tell you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0388,I mean well there I'm sure that you know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0389,there would be hard conversations like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0390,I'd hate to have to come home and say
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0391,you know I lost my job or you know I'm I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0392,don't know I hope that wouldn't be
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0393,because of me I'm not saying because of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0394,you but I'd still be afraid to tell you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0395,because it's just you know I don't need
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0396,that in my life like any kind of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0397,catastrophe I would feel bad I'm telling
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0398,you in terms of fears I think my it's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0399,gonna be horrible just gonna tell you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0400,a fear that I have had which is gonna be
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0401,horrible for you but probably silly for
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0402,people watching this is that at some
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0403,point you're not going to be there and I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0404,will be there and your gun will die my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0405,job yes and I will have to tell you that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0406,she died because you will think that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0407,did do you think I'm gonna be at work I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0408,feel like sometimes I'm gonna be there
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0409,when it happens
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0410,and I'm gonna have to be the one to tell
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0411,you that's interesting oh because I have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0412,such clear visions of what's gonna
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0413,happen when she died - we sound really
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0414,morbid
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0415,but really do you know it's supposed to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0416,be yeah it is she's an old dog I'm just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0417,saying it could happen I know and I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0418,desperately don't want it to happen when
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0419,I'm there and you're not I wouldn't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0420,think you did it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0421,I would feel a good thing somehow you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0422,wouldn't say it but somehow you would
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0423,say did you feed her today did she need
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0424,something somehow I'm we're talking
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0425,about beers we're talking about beers
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0426,and this is the only one that I actively
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0427,had okay you know not every time but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0428,like sometimes you go to get like a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0429,pedicure or something and I'm there and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0430,I check in with her make sure she's okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0431,sometimes in the morning before I leave
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0432,through work I like to make sure that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0433,her chest is rising and falling okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0434,partly because I've I gotta get to work
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0435,I don't have time to do that I'm just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0436,being honest was that yours or mine that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0437,was I asked you okay but wishing that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0438,again you will be irrational about it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0439,you don't think you are now cuz you've
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0440,got this no I have a plan I know how
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0441,it's gonna or not everything is gonna
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0442,work out according to plan I think is my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0443,fear in the back of your mind
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0444,are you scared that I'll walk away
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0445,always why the why I know it's why do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0446,you think I would do that um everybody
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0447,does
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0448,Wow
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0449,how much time do you have right um no I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0450,mean I think there are three people in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0451,my life that I know or not I can ever
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0452,walk away and it took them years to get
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0453,there it took them years to earn that or
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0454,it took you years to realize it I think
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0455,it goes hand in hand
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0456,Noby and so I think as short as we are
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0457,into it I you haven't quite like died
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0458,out you haven't proven yet nothing
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0459,there's nothing to prove nothing you're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0460,tested but well if these other three
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0461,people have been tested and won or have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0462,been not found to be lacking mm-hmm I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0463,wondering if they knew that they were in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0464,the process of being tested or if it was
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0465,just all internally with you and when do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0466,you know and was it something that they
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0467,did that they were aware that they did
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0468,to get there did you say okay well they
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0469,did it I'm just wondering how long I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0470,have to work welp Jane okay yeah she did
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0471,stuff when I was a teenager that made me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0472,go oh she's not going anywhere
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0473,okay Celebes been there through
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0474,everything right and I understand I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0475,don't know I think I need 25 years and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0476,then Katie who we're just like one we're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0477,like okay so with her we went through
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0478,major life changes at the same time and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0479,it just sort of happened that I was like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0480,oh she she's never gonna go away
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0481,okay okay I'm glad for but but as I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0482,saying is no length of association yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0483,I guess it's like having been through
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0484,life experiences that they didn't run
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0485,and we just haven't had this yet but at
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0486,this point right now I mean you think
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0487,that if something should come up I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0488,gonna kind of bait and go
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0489,I feel more comfortable than I have with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0490,anybody else okay but do you think it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0491,would need something like that there
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0492,have to be an impetus for me to go it's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0493,not like I'm just gonna say well I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0494,going
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0495,for a pack of smokes that's not good
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0496,because it's a 1960s TV no for a Becca
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0497,good for you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0498,no I think it's I think it's just I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0499,think it's just time I think I asked you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0500,that yeah yeah who would struggle more
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0501,if we broke up I feel I would hate I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0502,just feel like I would I feel like you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0503,have like such a support group around
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0504,you that would be like it's alright he
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0505,was a jerk blah blah whatever happened
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0506,they would understand whatever I feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0507,like you would have people around you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0508,okay to help you through it you would I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0509,would have people telling me how dumb I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0510,was oh yeah you screwed up I may be I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0511,think I have my friends would say what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0512,did you do okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0513,yeah and then I feel I would just you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0514,know fall into myself you know yes just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0515,grow the giant beard and you know just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0516,be sad all the time yeah mm-hmm I mean
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0517,it could be you I think it seemed to me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0518,it would be me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0519,hmm which one of my friends have you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0520,slept with I mean would you sleep with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0521,have I slept with I don't think anybody

Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0524,I've been with the world but we do have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0525,some mutual friends like I don't think
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0526,it would be one of your best friends but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0527,there are a couple of times that I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0528,like I wonder if he knows that person
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0529,from all right who would you sleep with
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0530,that was the second part never metal is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0531,mad enough of them in now but the one
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0532,guys that are the straight guys that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0533,don't really know you just don't want to

Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0538,consider wrong with my friends like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0539,maybe like no I can't even okay I guess
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0540,nobody I can't picture it myself so
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0541,don't feel bad I wouldn't want to sleep
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0542,with any of them there are stories I've
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0543,heard from fraternity days that I can
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0544,see if I were in college and we were in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0545,college together
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0546,then I would have gone for that frat guy
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0547,but I don't know him I've never met him
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0548,I probably never will okay like I can
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0549,think about the kind of guy I would have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0550,gone for definitely well now and not go

Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0562,know just back and forth with other
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0563,folks but I don't know that there's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0564,anything untoward that I would see if

Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0568,stories that that's what people do now
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0569,but I don't know I don't know I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0570,know that I'd find a lot of that I think

Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0584,that's the point
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0585,hmm everything you've ever done I've
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0586,told you instantly like smacking
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0587,chocolate ice cream there's no need to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0588,smack it's pretty well I think you're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0589,also too attuned to that and others okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0590,I don't pay attention to what other
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0591,people are eating on the subway or how
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0592,they sound eating it I wasn't anything
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0593,ice cream on the subway I haven't seen
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0594,yet and the comfort of our home and I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0595,didn't realize that I was making that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0596,kind of noise I think it bothers you but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0597,you're the only person I've ever met who
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0598,it bothers um I know something it's hard
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0599,to say can't stand but something that is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0600,of concern
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0601,could I I don't know I don't know what
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0602,they were although I feel like you don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0603,take out for yourself enough like it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0604,work take up for myself and I think like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0605,right now that doesn't affect me but I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0606,think in the future it could like if you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0607,don't insist on promotions and raises or
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0608,going out and getting another job I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0609,think in the future because I'm gonna do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0610,that every year every other year every
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0611,five years whatever well so see only
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0612,you're in a different level
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0613,professionally well in a different
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0614,purpose but why because nice because I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0615,never cuz I do that every couple of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0616,years I would say I want you to be like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0617,me cuz I'm sometimes a little too much
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0618,go-getter ish then I think people should
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0619,it's it might also be what you do yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0620,cuz you know that you can go somewhere
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0621,else and do that somewhere else yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0622,fairly easily yeah where's I feel like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0623,where I just stand on my principles and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0624,say well then I'm out of here
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0625,you're you to have to be okay with me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0626,being employed for a long time you're
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0627,right yeah which is I guess I guess I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0628,would rather be employed and maybe have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0629,to each and every now and then and not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0630,get paid exactly what I think I should
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0631,be paid okay but it's also my fault for
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0632,working too hard or doing too good of a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0633,job and then feeling bad that I'm not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0634,recognized for it but that you think you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0635,come home and feel bad about it and then
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0636,what I feel bad about it but I also feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0637,stupid for like you know yeah working
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0638,too hard at the place that doesn't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0639,appreciate it but you know so can't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0640,stand as strong but I worry I just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0641,really want to worry about thank you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0642,like that are you worried about me are
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0643,you worried about us in terms of our
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0644,weight about you you'll be good either
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0645,way there's more power in the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0646,relationship you were me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0647,power power what kind of power you tell
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0648,me I don't know I feel like you I know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0649,what you're I think I am
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0650,I don't know that you think you have
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0651,more power I think that you think that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0652,delegate a lot of power to you okay I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0653,think that you think that I sit back and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0654,let you do most of the planning and or
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0655,you know and you think that equals power
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0656,I don't know about power I mean I think
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0657,that you know I don't know like you you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0658,have definite ideas about things and I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0659,don't necessarily one way or the other
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0660,so you win that one we do a lot of stuff
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0661,that you want to do and it's not that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0662,don't want to do it yeah it's just that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0663,I don't have a lot of other stuff
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0664,demanding my time okay I'm free and easy
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0665,I'm breezy I'm good with it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0666,I'm breezy I'm good I'm good with it all
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0667,of it so I think in terms of power I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0668,think you know I think you feel that you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0669,make a lot of decisions and then I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0670,should make more power though you mean
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0671,well then what's your idea of it cuz I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0672,guess I actually think we're pretty
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0673,equal cuz I think you know that the day
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0674,you decided you didn't want to go see X
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0675,movie whatever but you know I'd be like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0676,oh absolutely which would be like you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0677,making the final call you don't think I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0678,do that now no but I think you know if
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0679,he did I would go oh absolutely
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0680,okay that's probably true yeah but I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0681,also don't feel that I need to exert
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0682,that kind of power he's never there has
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0683,not been a there's not been in a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0684,presidential veto that I feel I had to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0685,extend on anything right you know I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0686,think it's also pretty clear what I will
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0687,and will not do and vice versa you know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0688,it's not like you know let's bring
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0689,so-and-so into it now
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0690,that I think we're good we're equal in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0691,terms of that but I feel like in terms
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0692,of a lot of they're like a couple stuff
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0693,you feel like you do a lot of the heavy
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0694,lifting okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0695,but I guess that's a different
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0696,interpretation of power yeah is that me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0697,if you could change one thing in our
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0698,relationship what would it be and why
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0699,that's not fun
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0700,if I wanted to change it I would cuz you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0701,have the power
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0702,no cuz I've been in enough bad
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0703,relationships that I either just ran
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0704,when things got bad or flat things get
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0705,stay bad for too long that I promised
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0706,myself I wouldn't do that again
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0707,so there's any like changes to be made I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0708,think I would tell you and make them
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0709,together okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0710,I think we have done that yeah we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0711,haven't had any like major changes I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0712,mean I guess the only thing I would
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0713,change is that we would both make a lot
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0714,more money and I mean work a lot less
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0715,like that's not a good thing in our
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0716,relationship it's yeah yeah it's math in
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0717,our power to do babe who'd be nice I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0718,mean I can't think of anything clay yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0719,I would want to change either but you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0720,know we're still just start now yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0721,okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0722,oh oh no I don't want to ask this if I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0723,going to okay do you want to marry me
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0724,this is all been a trick it's all of it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0725,your mom's gonna be jumping
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0726,where's they're eating they're gonna
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0727,play that Bruno Mars song do I want do I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0728,want um it's a thought I know you know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0729,we've had a discussion is that some it's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0730,not something I need like there's no
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0731,religious reason to do it there's it's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0732,not for the children it's not her you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0733,know my mother doesn't give a shit no
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0734,one's gonna pressure me into marrying
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0735,you I don't have significant debt that
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0736,would tie you up so I don't feel like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0737,there's a reason not to it might be good
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0738,for our taxes or it might be bad for our
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0739,taxes but that seems like a really cold
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0740,estimation of why someone would use
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0741,illegal agree with that you know we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0742,can't protect you understood understood
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0743,and there's not that you know we can't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0744,even really do the Brad Pitt and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0745,Angelina Jolie until all can be married
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0746,we will stay you know that kind of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0747,bullshit because everyone's pretty much
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0748,doing it now but for the most part in my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0749,home state Wow
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0750,backwards ex that they are do I want to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0751,I'm pretty sure that was question do you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0752,want to marry me um yeah I wouldn't I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0753,mean it's gonna sound it's such a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0754,pretentious question and people get so
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0755,tied up in it and it's like a magic
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0756,moment but I wouldn't sure I mean I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0757,don't have any pressure either way like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0758,I'm not afraid of it I can totally see
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0759,it happening but I don't know what my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0760,reasoning for it would be it is
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0761,interesting because we talked about but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0762,I would also need to know going into it
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0763,that you would want to before you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0764,propose yeah you spent the money on
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0765,their ring yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0766,well all that aside not even the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0767,proposal in the Rings I just wouldn't I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0768,would need to know that it was you know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0769,something that you and one as well we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0770,would need to have a discussion well we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0771,talked about this very early on like way
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0772,earlier than we probably should have but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0773,it was like I want to make sure that you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0774,know this is made for me and if it is a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0775,need for you then we might not it's not
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0776,a date it's ever been Anita I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0777,perfectly fine happy being
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0778,the unmarried couple you know the cool
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0779,kids yeah like I said it's never been on
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0780,my list it's never been there's no
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0781,there's no reason to do it other than to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0782,do it and I wouldn't mind doing it if
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0783,it's something that we decided we wanted
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0784,to do or if some reasoning came up like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0785,I think if we were gonna have kids you
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0786,know 1950s dad and me would want to say
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0787,okay I looked at married you know just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0788,so you the kids can whatever you know we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0789,were gonna adopt something I don't know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0790,or if legally there was something like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0791,we couldn't see the dog if the dog was
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0792,ill without yeah then yes but I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0793,have any strong stirrings to get married
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0794,and does that have anything really to do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0795,with you it's not anything having it's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0796,their judgment on you or on us I feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0797,family I just feel like as an
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0798,institution it's never been you know but
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0799,of course my father was married like
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0800,four times
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0801,it was very dream so you know the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0802,sanctity of it is in question it's a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0803,joke
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0804,yeah I don't know I can't forgive any of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0805,your okay
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0806,yeah I can't think of any of your
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0807,friends that I would sleep with I was
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0808,gonna ask that whoo it's awkward which
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0809,is whatever the question was which of my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0810,friends would you sleep with I just
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0811,thought I couldn't think of anybody I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0812,don't know I mean I feel like I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0813,know
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0814,there's a reason for not doing all of
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0815,them like I feel like most of your
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0816,friends are gay so you know I don't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0817,think Christina would be interested yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0818,I thought you would say her
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0819,no no I don't know if I have what she
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0820,needs
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0821,after you know uh you know I've heard
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0822,stories but I don't know it just I feel
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0823,like your friends are your friends I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0824,would let you know yeah it's weird
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0825,yeah you don't have anything you enough
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0826,I feel like we were kind of tandem and
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0827,answering them anywhere at least we were
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0828,in agreement I felt like the questions
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0829,were great but I can we're just boring
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0830,okay I made the joke that we're boring
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0831,mm-hmm I can't think of anything that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0832,need to know or you know oh do you want
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0833,to marry me can we do that one we can do
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0834,that one I actually thought you were
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0835,gonna do that I'm not saying that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0836,answer for us no I know I feel alone I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0837,feel pretty much the same way my issues
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0838,are I do I do you want to ask that one
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0839,yeah well marry one okay so I feel the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0840,same way mmm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0841,but having been married for legal
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0842,reasons and not love reasons I also see
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0843,it differently right which I figure yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0844,I like to have a reception I'd like to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0845,have a party in a pink dress I figure we
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0846,can do that at some point there'll be
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0847,some milestone but I feel like that's
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0848,just the girl in mean that once all the
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0849,bride's Oeste know I don't wanna be a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0850,bridezilla you would be I want a pink
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0851,dress yeah
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0852,what am I scared to tell you you can't
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0853,ask me well what are you scared to tell
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0854,me I'm always scared to talk about my
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0855,past
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0856,I always feel the need to qualify
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0857,everything and we've even talked about
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0858,that that you feeling you don't have to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0859,explain it to me like the fact that I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0860,married my gay best friend so that his
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0861,parents didn't kill em Gilles bench I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0862,mean yeah like I feel I feel like so
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0863,many times between that and now so many
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0864,people have questioned me like they
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0865,didn't believe me like I think I'm a
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0866,woman scorned or that I you know I'm
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0867,saving face and whatever that I always
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0868,feel like I'm having to qualify it so
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0869,anytime something when it comes up I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0870,feel maybe scared it's more of a dread
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0871,feeling but it's like ah I have to
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0872,explain myself to anyone and with you I
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0873,want I find myself not so much anymore
Man009_Woman009_Transcription_0874,but like wanting to get like if details
