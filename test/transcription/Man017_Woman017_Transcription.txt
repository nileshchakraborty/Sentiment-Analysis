Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0005,always kind of thing about that what
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0006,that was and then you know the fact that

Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0018,you're my best friend I think that's
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0019,probably one of the most important
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0020,things to me it's the fact that you

Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0035,you pause before you tell me or anything
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0036,like that there are things that wait and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0037,if I feel like if something's going to

Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0055,relationship you or me

Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0060,neck hey turn the head great what
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0061,bothered you about being the sole income
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0062,provider well that's actually more your
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0063,question since I'm really not that's
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0064,more than your question to answer I know
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0065,it makes me feel awkward and it makes me
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0066,feel then I'm not keeping up my end of
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0067,the bargain it's not exactly cheap I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0068,live over here and stuff you know yeah
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0069,but I'll never understand what you think
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0070,like that because I've always had my own
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0071,job my own income been so completely
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0072,self-reliant that I took the past two
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0073,years have been really rough I mean I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0074,really feel like I've lost part of my
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0075,identity
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0076,so not I got any the little strong more
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0077,like um know a little bit of the
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0078,security in who I was and who I am and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0079,who I knew myself to be for so long and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0080,especially because I was so in my career
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0081,the entire time that we've been together
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0082,that this is just a completely weird
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0083,misstep for me you know yeah everyone
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0084,has hard times and we're a couple so it
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0085,doesn't know
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0086,I know wow in the back of your mind are
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0087,you scared that I'll walk away
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0088,at times I think everyone thinks that I

Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0090,time ago
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0091,well we bid through I don't think it

Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0094,day when I was let's be like barely
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0095,working it was hard it was really really
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0096,hard because I always felt like I was
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0097,not living up to your expectations
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0098,sort of like the way I feel now but
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0099,we've both been there and we've gotten
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0100,through everything right oh this is very
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0101,end up with the sex questions you guys
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0102,am I the best sex you've ever had
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0103,[Laughter]

Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0107,say that it's not that it's you're not
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0108,the best sex I've ever had
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0109,well no I mean we've been together for
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0110,almost 20 years
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0111,no no I know but it's just it's so
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0112,awkward for me it's no secret we can
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0113,just name it I know why it's it's the
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0114,kind of thing where no but the type of
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0115,sex that we have is a different type of
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0116,sex than I've ever had with anyone else
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0117,so to just randomly compare it one it's
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0118,apples and oranges is obnoxious at that
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0119,you know yeah it's all fruit it's all
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0120,straight sex granted this you know
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0121,different flavors
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0122,but it's it's a completely it's a
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0123,different scenario it's not like I can
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0124,equally wear a moment the other but I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0125,don't talk to you about this I don't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0126,think we really do talk about this in
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0127,all the time that very rare we very rare
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0128,yeah like yeah no so that was kinda
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0129,interesting yeah wow that's terrible no
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0130,it's it did you ever want children with
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0131,me yes I don't even have to hesitate yes
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0132,how do you feel we've grown apart
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0133,I think the older that we are just we're
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0134,not as forgiving enough to write them in
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0135,the right words but I don't think that
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0136,we gave each other a lot of leeway with
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0137,certain subjects anymore like I'm not
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0138,gonna put up with you when you do
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0139,conservative Republican bullshit because
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0140,you know conservative Republican is
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0141,someone you say shit like that it really
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0142,drives me batshit and I won't put up
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0143,with any more and I tell you you know to
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0144,shut up I think in terms of stuff like
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0145,that but I don't think that we've really
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0146,grown apart in that way unless you are
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0147,saying like the whole sexually thing
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0148,which is again I just consider that
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0149,normal and I'm so that um you know I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0150,don't felt like I'm 20 anymore I just we
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0151,you know what would you do if I cheated
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0152,on you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0153,[Laughter]
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0154,something like honestly though I already
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0155,kind of know we can sort of go by this
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0156,one oh well this I would not be a happy
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0157,man
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0158,I just I just just because of the
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0159,history game one of those it's just not
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0160,something yeah don't you have to be
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0161,concerned about it I'm very into time
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0162,one who said before I start another no I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0163,wouldn't do that
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0164,we both know each other better than that
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0165,what are you scared to tell me
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0166,when I fuck up bad I know it sounds old
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0167,or ridiculous but it's more it's more a
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0168,matter of it's not when I messed up so
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0169,much it's where I do something or I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0170,don't do something or I procrastinate
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0171,about something to the point where I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0172,think you're going to be disappointed in
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0173,me it's almost like I don't want to
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0174,disappoint you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0175,you don't I mean it's not so it's not
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0176,like you know like be afraid to tell you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0177,something it's just you know like going
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0178,out and drinking too much wine and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0179,falling asleep in the cab on the way
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0180,home and losing my phone you know like
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0181,the same shit everybody does except you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0182,know they did it fifteen years younger I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0183,mean stuff like that it's it's more I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0184,don't want to disappoint you and I don't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0185,want to embarrass myself by being
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0186,immature but I kind of feel like no no
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0187,fuck it sometimes I'm gonna disappoint
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0188,you but you love me anyway
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0189,okay so it's not really like there's
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0190,nothing really that I'd be like afraid
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0191,talking about but hmm
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0192,do you feel like we've lived up to the
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0193,dreams we had when we started this
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0194,relationship why or why not I don't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0195,think we've lived up to our potential
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0196,because well it's good to have you give
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0197,me a moment there's just been so many
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0198,things I've happened along the way with
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0199,family and everything and loss of jobs
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0200,and it's just it's hard sometimes when
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0201,it when you I thought by this time we we
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0202,don't know already it's just sometimes
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0203,just talking I think that's probably I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0204,never really wanted the house no I never
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0205,would even even like I didn't want to
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0206,watch it but you know to have a space of
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0207,do you and I have a family you know be
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0208,like Auntie Mame you know like all that
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0209,I really wanted but it hasn't worked out
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0210,like that well it's it's not over yet
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0211,see your truth of mine I actually don't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0212,go just go with us man was the biggest
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0213,compromise you've made I haven't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0214,acknowledged
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0215,I don't think that don't think go into
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0216,that huh I just I don't think it's
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0217,anything that you haven't acknowledged
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0218,per se without delving into more of it I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0219,think it's more you don't take it as
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0220,serious as I think I don't think you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0221,realize how much it affects me
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0222,why do you love me I honestly I can't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0223,even narrow that down why I I just don't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0224,I can't have anything everything
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0225,everything that makes you you this corny
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0226,Sophie's that sounds it's just you what
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0227,do I do that detracts from our
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0228,relationship oh my god you become like
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0229,and eat your own boy and you have a
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0230,temper tantrum beg for Captain Crunch
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0231,because I left one sheet of paper towel
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0232,you're having an epic meltdown like I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0233,was just like no you can't have the
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0234,boxes here fucking doing it like really
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0235,back Roy is probably that's up there
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0236,that's my hissy fits well and I mean
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0237,what is your question that might
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0238,in the time that we have shared together
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0239,do you have any resentment toward me
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0240,though see no I don't think that's true
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0241,why do you think that's true I think I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0242,don't know so much now because you're in
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0243,a power position without sounding
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0244,amounts just I don't mean it like you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0245,know like you mourn over me or anything
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0246,but relationship wise right now you're
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0247,in a power position and I think that
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0248,when I was still VP company and I was
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0249,devoting so much time to my career and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0250,something that was so outside of us and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0251,outside of our relationship and our
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0252,lives together I think that part of you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0253,we not only resented me but that really
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0254,didn't like me as a person and I just
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0255,don't think that you like the person
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0256,that I was and I think that's also when
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0257,we probably had most of our discord and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0258,the problems in our relationship I think
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0259,it was probably our worst point
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0260,especially the last like five years or
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0261,so there I think that you've resented
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0262,the amount of time I spent there how
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0263,much more I cared or appear to care
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0264,about well I don't think I wouldn't
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0265,advise that you resented the amount of
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0266,time you were giving that as opposed to
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0267,us because I felt like you were just
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0268,killing yourself with no reason for so
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0269,long you see why I would take away oh
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0270,absolutely absolutely
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0271,it's reason
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0272,still swimmin you what story Zeppelin
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0273,when do I hurt you when I'm trying to
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0274,lead you down the right path and you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0275,just won't listen
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0276,and you know what I'm talking about
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0277,do you know exactly what I'm talking
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0278,about when I'm Quillan hurting myself I
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0279,try to just really back in if I can and
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0280,when you just don't even give me the
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0281,chance to explain their hurts me at
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0282,times but most of the time when I'm at
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0283,like to Adam thinking of you
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0284,list the top three best memories from
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0285,our relationship top three that's a long
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0286,time time you coming in Vinod pneumonia
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0287,and showing up with like the saddest
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0288,plastic bottle of watching the craft for
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0289,like 599 times and just hanging out with
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0290,me because I was so sick I would
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0291,definitely and we weren't even having
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0292,sex at that point you know but I'd say
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0293,that's definitely one and another one is
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0294,not necessarily a particular time but
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0295,and even though there's a picture of it
Man017_Woman017_Transcription_0296,it's like a snapshot always in my head
