Man060_Woman065_0016,like I mean you played a man really well
Man060_Woman065_0017,but it was very obviously you're a woman
Man060_Woman065_0018,my obvious reasons and yeah I remember
Man060_Woman065_0019,whenever you came on stage with this
Man060_Woman065_0020,like swagger you walk that you've done
Man060_Woman065_0021,but like after yeah I remember yeah that
Man060_Woman065_0022,was I think yeah it was the first time I

Man060_Woman065_0025,you go yeah when do you feel closest to
Man060_Woman065_0026,me I'm back from very intimate moments I
Man060_Woman065_0027,don't know and I feel closest to you
Man060_Woman065_0028,just like lying on the couch I think
Man060_Woman065_0029,back in Dublin I used to feel very close
Man060_Woman065_0030,to you I mean to remember just moments
Man060_Woman065_0031,in your bedroom just air is kissing that
Man060_Woman065_0032,was very obviously very very close yeah
Man060_Woman065_0033,I think that's a really really intimate
Man060_Woman065_0034,moment yeah you said look at it when we
Man060_Woman065_0035,look at each other sometimes it feels
Man060_Woman065_0036,very very close these days these days
Man060_Woman065_0037,the same I think yeah we don't spend as
Man060_Woman065_0038,long kissing but it's too
Man060_Woman065_0039,when I feel closest to you for sure oh
Man060_Woman065_0040,yeah my god oh yeah when do you feel
Man060_Woman065_0041,closer to me
Man060_Woman065_0042,like right before we go to bed or
Man060_Woman065_0043,exactly when we wake up in the morning
Man060_Woman065_0044,see I'm really groggy honey I'm really I
Man060_Woman065_0045,was like well yes Stephen we go we go
Man060_Woman065_0046,and then right before I go to bed you're
Man060_Woman065_0047,proper like I don't like a light and I'm
Man060_Woman065_0048,still there like oh so that's really
Man060_Woman065_0049,when I don't feel closest to you at all
Man060_Woman065_0050,okay
Man060_Woman065_0051,why do you hesitant to tell me that's
Man060_Woman065_0052,what I'm hesitant to give any of it I
Man060_Woman065_0053,think I was hesitant to tell you it's
Man060_Woman065_0054,like you need to stop working or like
Man060_Woman065_0055,pay attention to me or something yeah
Man060_Woman065_0056,that's when I do work yeah yeah yeah
Man060_Woman065_0057,yeah is that it - anything else he
Man060_Woman065_0058,hasn't won any weight I'm hesitant to
Man060_Woman065_0059,tell you about my secret my secret like
Man060_Woman065_0060,things that I do yeah
Man060_Woman065_0061,well you know that that lamp but it was
Man060_Woman065_0062,a secret it was a beautiful secret well
Man060_Woman065_0063,it's still lasted and sometimes I go for
Man060_Woman065_0064,like bike rides on my own and just have
Man060_Woman065_0065,some me time I think I'm kind of because
Man060_Woman065_0066,I like having that place for myself
Man060_Woman065_0067,maybe I don't let you and on because I'm
Man060_Woman065_0068,hesitant to tell you about that because
Man060_Woman065_0069,I feel that you'd feel very isolated if
Man060_Woman065_0070,I had my own time that I wasn't letting
Man060_Woman065_0071,you in on yeah but it's not it's not
Man060_Woman065_0072,something that's for you it's for me for
Man060_Woman065_0073,me I think and in the same way that I
Man060_Woman065_0074,think I needed to go to France and Spain
Man060_Woman065_0075,and things like I need to do things on
Man060_Woman065_0076,my own I think and I think I'm hesitant
Man060_Woman065_0077,to tell you that I need to do that but
Man060_Woman065_0078,it's not it's just something that I need
Man060_Woman065_0079,to do because I need to develop for
Man060_Woman065_0080,myself I think so that's what I'd be
Man060_Woman065_0081,hesitant to tell you that
Man060_Woman065_0082,how do you feel about that you sure yeah
Man060_Woman065_0083,it doesn't as long as I know where you
Man060_Woman065_0084,are funny that's the fun I'm not telling
Man060_Woman065_0085,you where I am it could be anyway okay
Man060_Woman065_0086,what's the biggest challenge to our
Man060_Woman065_0087,relationship and how do you think we can
Man060_Woman065_0088,solve this hmm I think there's a few
Man060_Woman065_0089,challenges I think right now we've a
Man060_Woman065_0090,very obvious challenge of just trying to
Man060_Woman065_0091,find our way in the world and like
Man060_Woman065_0092,working really hard and doing our own
Man060_Woman065_0093,thing that's a huge challenge but I
Man060_Woman065_0094,think as well too smooth I think we're
Man060_Woman065_0095,very foundational in our relationship
Man060_Woman065_0096,Buddha's odd I don't know whether that's
Man060_Woman065_0097,a challenge like that we rooted maybe
Man060_Woman065_0098,knows I don't really know where I'm
Man060_Woman065_0099,going with this what do you think is I
Man060_Woman065_0100,think is challenged
Man060_Woman065_0101,you think a I don't know what are this
Man060_Woman065_0102,doesn't work yeah that it it's just like
Man060_Woman065_0103,I feel like we do really have challenges
Man060_Woman065_0104,but we don't they seem so trivial
Man060_Woman065_0105,presently in the bigger picture yeah
Man060_Woman065_0106,yeah because we're so ambitious to reach
Man060_Woman065_0107,a point whereby we're both very
Man060_Woman065_0108,comfortable that they all just like we
Man060_Woman065_0109,just there's no question that we won't
Man060_Woman065_0110,get through them I don't think I would
Man060_Woman065_0111,like to think I agree it doesn't nothing
Man060_Woman065_0112,feels like a challenge I worry about
Man060_Woman065_0113,things when we actually sit down and
Man060_Woman065_0114,talk about it I think cuz we do allow
Man060_Woman065_0115,ourselves the space to talk about it
Man060_Woman065_0116,but when we don't talk about it then it
Man060_Woman065_0117,becomes a challenge
Man060_Woman065_0118,maybe our challenges when we don't talk
Man060_Woman065_0119,and we get distracted by other things
Man060_Woman065_0120,that are really important
Man060_Woman065_0121,perhaps as am i go you go okay when was
Man060_Woman065_0122,the last time I disappointed you and how
Man060_Woman065_0123,did you feel about it
Man060_Woman065_0124,I feel like we're gonna come across as
Man060_Woman065_0125,really boring which we're not I'm gone

Man060_Woman065_0132,house and I didn't go to party with my
Man060_Woman065_0133,friends because he needed well you
Man060_Woman065_0134,needed me to support you so that's all
Man060_Woman065_0135,very well and good but I feel like oh
Man060_Woman065_0136,yeah that was really bad come on there
Man060_Woman065_0137,was bad I can't think of anything
Man060_Woman065_0138,there's got to be like what about when I

Man060_Woman065_0164,we should like elaborate more we just go
Man060_Woman065_0165,back and do the same questions to get
Man060_Woman065_0166,maybe a decision oh when is the best sex

Man060_Woman065_0174,there's only one timer is there like no
Man060_Woman065_0175,a few times just in general yes okay
Man060_Woman065_0176,letter Ike

Man060_Woman065_0178,being with you you're missing out
Man060_Woman065_0179,probably like being really sad I think
Man060_Woman065_0180,you really happy you met me a Michigan
Man060_Woman065_0181,unlike lonely artist lifestyle yeah
Man060_Woman065_0182,that's a lady you're missing it I'm
Man060_Woman065_0183,sorry
Man060_Woman065_0184,no that's really it's not really it's
Man060_Woman065_0185,not really big headed no it's true I
Man060_Woman065_0186,think you'd be really sad if you were me
Man060_Woman065_0187,you'd probably be you actually know I
Man060_Woman065_0188,think if we if we weren't together you
Man060_Woman065_0189,might have gone abroad for university
Man060_Woman065_0190,which means you might be some like
Man060_Woman065_0191,massive scholar somewhere more than
Man060_Woman065_0192,likely Oxford I'd say I'd say you would
Man060_Woman065_0193,have probably not gone into the arts
Man060_Woman065_0194,because maybe you felt that support from
Man060_Woman065_0195,my side that's true yeah I think you
Man060_Woman065_0196,would have gone into maybe literature
Man060_Woman065_0197,yeah maybe a journalist journalist in
Man060_Woman065_0198,New York or something no you wouldn't
Man060_Woman065_0199,live in New York and okay what do you
Man060_Woman065_0200,think I'm missing out on by not being in
Man060_Woman065_0201,this by being in this relationship may
Man060_Woman065_0202,be more fun yeah you're quite serious oh
Man060_Woman065_0203,you're quite serious in general yeah
Man060_Woman065_0204,thank you I made you grow up very fast I
Man060_Woman065_0205,think you did yeah I think I missed but
Man060_Woman065_0206,if we weren't in this lady it might
Man060_Woman065_0207,still be a child yeah yeah I think I'd
Man060_Woman065_0208,be like I don't know I don't even want
Man060_Woman065_0209,to think about it I'd be awful but you'd
Man060_Woman065_0210,probably be happy I'd hate myself I'd be
Man060_Woman065_0211,just like this whoof kind of I don't
Man060_Woman065_0212,know that's a be kind of thought I'd
Man060_Woman065_0213,said we fought kind of gamer very far
Man060_Woman065_0214,removed where I'd still wear really
Man060_Woman065_0215,baggy jeans you've really tastefully
Man060_Woman065_0216,caught out all the bad like things you
Man060_Woman065_0217,really change me when mmm put it in your
Man060_Woman065_0218,capable hands
Man060_Woman065_0219,I think but I'm very glad to not be
Man060_Woman065_0220,there it could be having maybe more fun
Man060_Woman065_0221,probably I yeah I think you've really
Man060_Woman065_0222,made me kind of serious yeah I take
Man060_Woman065_0223,myself a lot more seriously but I'm not
Man060_Woman065_0224,more comfortable myself and a lot more
Man060_Woman065_0225,self-confident as well yeah
Man060_Woman065_0226,oh yeah fresh okay when were you closest
Man060_Woman065_0227,to ending the relationship what didn't
Man060_Woman065_0228,and why is that for me ie this is
Man060_Woman065_0229,something I really shouldn't say I
Man060_Woman065_0230,I was very seriously considering ending
Man060_Woman065_0231,that not ending the relationship but I
Man060_Woman065_0232,was like why am I doing this when before
Man060_Woman065_0233,we went on holidays last time just like
Man060_Woman065_0234,a few weeks ago when you were just in
Man060_Woman065_0235,this tonal vision focus and I felt so
Man060_Woman065_0236,isolated in every room in every regard
Man060_Woman065_0237,because I mean we're living here with no
Man060_Woman065_0238,friends where we have friends here but
Man060_Woman065_0239,we've no real friends here for very very
Man060_Woman065_0240,isolated when I felt unsupported and
Man060_Woman065_0241,really sad and I was wondering is it
Man060_Woman065_0242,healthy for me to be in this
Man060_Woman065_0243,relationship and is this something that
Man060_Woman065_0244,I want to put up with yeah that was like
Man060_Woman065_0245,maybe I should call it into thought the
Man060_Woman065_0246,past in my mind for maybe for a few
Man060_Woman065_0247,hours yeah few areas I was like what
Man060_Woman065_0248,should I do
Man060_Woman065_0249,I was so upset because I the chicken no
Man060_Woman065_0250,no I think I'm I thought about it a lot
Man060_Woman065_0251,I didn't like I mean it was always like
Man060_Woman065_0252,an option I think it's always an option
Man060_Woman065_0253,that we're in the relationship but it's
Man060_Woman065_0254,not something that we a decision that
Man060_Woman065_0255,I'm gonna take because I had
Man060_Woman065_0256,because there's no battery removed in my
Man060_Woman065_0257,bedroom for two hours like that's not a
Man060_Woman065_0258,reason that relationship I mean I think
Man060_Woman065_0259,we definitely needed to get away we just
Man060_Woman065_0260,needed to like leave everything that we
Man060_Woman065_0261,just leave our ambitions behind and just
Man060_Woman065_0262,focus on us for a while because I really
Man060_Woman065_0263,felt like we were just in a really bad
Man060_Woman065_0264,place it was really really hard and I
Man060_Woman065_0265,mean all our friends are gonna say all
Man060_Woman065_0266,over the world now and they're doing
Man060_Woman065_0267,their own thing so I just felt like I
Man060_Woman065_0268,know how to talk to I'm better because
Man060_Woman065_0269,usually I go to you about all my
Man060_Woman065_0270,problems with our problems it's also
Man060_Woman065_0271,there's no how to talk to your vanity
Man060_Woman065_0272,not there not in real life you know yeah
Man060_Woman065_0273,that's the most of my feel like that is
Man060_Woman065_0274,very recent and it's completely like
Man060_Woman065_0275,tables have completely flipped since but
Man060_Woman065_0276,yeah I think we're in a very very good
Man060_Woman065_0277,place right now well we did we took the
Man060_Woman065_0278,time to yeah sort of son's age yeah for
Man060_Woman065_0279,you for sure as well did you feel
Man060_Woman065_0280,supported at that point are you yeah
Man060_Woman065_0281,well when's the last time you won today
Man060_Woman065_0282,in the relationship maybe that's a
Man060_Woman065_0283,reason was it in 30 I did notice on you
Man060_Woman065_0284,that's a problem that's a huge problem
Man060_Woman065_0285,but it was more that I I was I was quite
Man060_Woman065_0286,sad yeah and I didn't want to put you
Man060_Woman065_0287,through that here such a happy person
Man060_Woman065_0288,mm-hmm it was probably good very nice
Man060_Woman065_0289,that's a great that was last time I feel
Man060_Woman065_0290,like I've actually had the last time I
Man060_Woman065_0291,mean I should probably add that I never
Man060_Woman065_0292,ever think about ending it except for
Man060_Woman065_0293,that one time but I was just I mean I
Man060_Woman065_0294,was just so frustrated really fed up
Man060_Woman065_0295,yeah but we've talked about in a lot
Man060_Woman065_0296,sense yeah I think right now we're in a
Man060_Woman065_0297,really really good place yeah I feel
Man060_Woman065_0298,like we should inject some humor into
Man060_Woman065_0299,this conversation because they're
Man060_Woman065_0300,usually really all the time yeah why do
Man060_Woman065_0301,you love me why do I love you because
Man060_Woman065_0302,you're cute you're really really really
Man060_Woman065_0303,cute and you never you net-like no one
Man060_Woman065_0304,else sees outside to you anyone who's
Man060_Woman065_0305,like watching this or whatever will
Man060_Woman065_0306,think that you're really serious and
Man060_Woman065_0307,really driven and blah blah but you're
Man060_Woman065_0308,so cute you're like this little cap
Man060_Woman065_0309,there's something utterly and no-one
Man060_Woman065_0310,else it's like I'm just my own private
Man060_Woman065_0311,gland I don't know what else guess is he
Man060_Woman065_0312,all right these very few people get to
Man060_Woman065_0313,see you you've got amazing this is a
Man060_Woman065_0314,terrible I don't know whether it isn't
Man060_Woman065_0315,go to her about the reason but you've
Man060_Woman065_0316,got sort of good taste and like you can
Man060_Woman065_0317,really know what you like and what you
