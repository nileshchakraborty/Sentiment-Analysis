Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0038,the door waiting for the person that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0039,looks like the photo to walk in the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0040,person I've been talking to and then
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0041,when you came in and so obviously so
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0042,clearly you and that was very exciting
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0043,because you matched up with the image I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0044,had built up as well just just very
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0045,quickly and how you expressed yourself
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0046,you know just in the moment to the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0047,presence of course I remember yes that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0048,big smile yeah taking up 90% of your
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0049,face and I don't I didn't think it was a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0050,conscious choice to stand up here just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0051,like that's yeah of course like oh I'm
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0052,gonna walk closer and say hi I remember
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0053,you being really animated very energetic
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0054,maybe it's because of what that guy was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0055,it like a cow the cacao candy thing
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0056,basically cocaine basically cocaine but
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0057,I didn't mean to yes yeah it was great
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0058,yeah so you know this was like a first
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0059,day thing so in a way and sometimes you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0060,know as the talkative kind of person you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0061,know I end up finding myself having to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0062,lead conversations and having toys drive
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0063,that momentum and all any any sense of
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0064,you know like weights or you know it was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0065,upcoming difficulty was just dissipated
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0066,like within 30 seconds yeah it felt like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0067,we knew each other yeah that's nice
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0068,comfortable exactly yeah all right is
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0069,the next question
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0070,when do you feel closest to me in some
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0071,ways may be lazy mornings you know just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0072,in that physical intimacy of that just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0073,being able to lay together be very
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0074,comfortable be good yeah
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0075,nuzzle it up I know so after after good
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0076,sex after that that sense of you know
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0077,that we managed to really satisfy each
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0078,other and that we were connected and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0079,that that emotional connection was there
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0080,as well and we can just kind of bask in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0081,in our in our abilities and in our in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0082,our at each other it's I feel very loved
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0083,and it's it's it's a very nice feeling
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0084,yeah well yeah I guess those moments we
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0085,are together in our own space yeah how
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0086,are you know I agree with you about sex
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0087,post-sex you know I just but I think
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0088,also when we're creating something
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0089,together when we're writing together and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0090,it just feels really productive and I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0091,say something and then you say something
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0092,and then I write something and then you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0093,do something and and it just feels like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0094,we're building off this momentum and I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0095,just feel like it's such an obvious
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0096,closeness that we have that we can we
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0097,can bounce those things around really
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0098,quickly and and have something to show
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0099,for that just like I don't know shows
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0100,how close we are it's not a competition
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0101,well what are you hesitant
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0102,tell me has a tenth of Terra yeah yeah
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0103,Wow I I don't I don't know I feel like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0104,we share everything you know I mean you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0105,know about issues in my past and exes
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0106,and crushes and you know any a lot of
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0107,the things that couples are hesitant to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0108,share or never do or you know my kinks
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0109,or my you know my annoyances and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0110,grievances like those those are things
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0111,that we talk about constantly so I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0112,really don't feel like I ever hesitate
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0113,to share anything with you probably
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0114,sometimes you wish I would maybe
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0115,hesitate a bit more sharing things but I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0116,really you know I you know that I can't
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0117,as soon as something comes up I have to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0118,tell you even if it's not at the right
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0119,time so there's no question you were
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0120,like oh I hope that's not a question
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0121,that eh yeah no you know and I've been
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0122,thinking about it the last couple days
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0123,and there hasn't been anything that I'm
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0124,like oh god I really I feel like I am as
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0125,open as I can be with someone with you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0126,yeah is there anything you're hesitant I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0127,think anything that was a reluctance at
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0128,any point I've already shared with you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0129,you know there were any parts that maybe
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0130,I was insecure about or oh you know I've
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0131,been really shared this part of myself
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0132,completely yet I definitely feel like I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0133,have there are no it's sighs it's not
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0134,exciting right that's not I wish there
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0135,is like a little something I never told
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0136,you about it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0137,yeah first unfortunate lack of the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0138,excitement of it no yeah
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0139,[Laughter]
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0140,what was the last trip that connected us
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0141,and why the last trip that connected us
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0142,yeah and why I know we go on somewhat
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0143,each other we do or one of the the best
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0144,trip that I linked at us anyway what
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0145,comes to mind is Israel you know what
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0146,you asked that question something last
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0147,trip I by any means but yeah because you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0148,know yeah I saw you visit you in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0149,Istanbul then there's that time apart
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0150,and then relatively quickly it felt we
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0151,you know travel together to Israel to to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0152,go to Jordan and all that and that was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0153,you know intense weekend a bit of us
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0154,just traveling and figuring out each
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0155,other's rhythms no Wade you know known
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0156,each other for what like three months
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0157,pretty much yeah and most of its through
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0158,a computer screen yeah so you know you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0159,think you saw me as me and I gonna see
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0160,you as you and I think it was exciting
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0161,to get our ideas of each other confirmed
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0162,to you know be pushed into a highly kind
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0163,of stressful situation but of course oh
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0164,so this was our earlier can I trip
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0165,together so maybe there was some aspect
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0166,or we got our best behavior or this that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0167,but I'd like to think otherwise and you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0168,know I I was there a bit longer and then
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0169,we talked while I was outside the museum
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0170,and we talked about what you're gonna be
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0171,doing next summer and whether you'd be
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0172,coming to the Netherlands or waiting so
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0173,it was highly kind of emotional and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0174,exciting to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0175,find out what that conclusion was going
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0176,to be and that you did decide to come
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0177,sooner than later I was maybe a bit
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0178,worried that you would feel like you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0179,would we're going to miss out on one
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0180,thing that you really wanted instead of
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0181,the other thing but I think I like to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0182,think the way the right choice said I'm
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0183,not really happy that you came he did so
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0184,yeah that really connected us I feel I I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0185,was thinking the trip the latest trip
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0186,that connected us was best kept secret
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0187,the festival you know we had a little
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0188,road trip down there to the south and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0189,then we worked on building this festival
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0190,together I just saw you had like some
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0191,manual labor and you know waking up
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0192,early and trekking to the site and then
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0193,your second all-time it was so sick but
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0194,we you know we push through and we met
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0195,people and and we were camping and not
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0196,really sleeping because it's a festival
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0197,I don't know what we were expecting but
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0198,you know actually literally sharing a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0199,tiny tent and not the best weather and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0200,but then we had those that moment when
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0201,the festival doors opened and we were
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0202,all like standing there together and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0203,seeing what we had created or been part
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0204,of creating and then we got to actually
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0205,stay for the whole festival and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0206,experience that music and Sunday morning
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0207,I think was it like really solidified
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0208,that connection for us for me you know
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0209,happy like lying there in the morning
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0210,and listening to agree with Jonny
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0211,Greenwood and the orchestra and it was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0212,like raining and relying on the picnic
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0213,blanket and you know we're a little
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0214,hungover from the weekend but you're
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0215,holding hands and just like really in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0216,that music really connected yeah and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0217,then stumbling upon some other bands
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0218,before leaving tora tora and then
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0219,sitting on the beach across from the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0220,festival before leaving just listening
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0221,to an echoing across the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0222,as I was really great yeah I felt really
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0223,really connected to you yeah
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0224,what is the biggest challenge to our
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0225,relationship and how do you think we can
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0226,solve it biggest challenge I don't think
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0227,it's lack of communication but I think
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0228,it's sometimes finding the right way to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0229,communicate what we need to communicate
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0230,I think that that just comes from being
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0231,different people alright coming from
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0232,different families and different
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0233,countries and and having and as similar
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0234,as we are in so many ways and even as
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0235,our families are you know the way that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0236,you express yourself sometimes is it's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0237,hard for me to interpret you know and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0238,and but we're learning we're learning
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0239,how to figure that out as we go along
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0240,and I think we're both patient people
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0241,and will over communicate until we
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0242,figure out why we can't communicate and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0243,then continue to communicate so I think
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0244,that that works for us you know wanting
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0245,to communicate and wanting to figure out
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0246,exactly why why is there confusion here
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0247,why aren't we understanding one another
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0248,and figuring out so we're we're we're
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0249,working on it I mean I've been I've been
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0250,and really just before we're talking too
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0251,much was actually the problem I mean in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0252,some ways because they've just become
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0253,this cycle of trying to talk about the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0254,issue and talking about that issue which
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0255,cause another issue which got another I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0256,should not obviously those weren't
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0257,didn't create a healthy relationship I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0258,mean is that a worry you would ever have
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0259,that would over communicate things no
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0260,I'm I'm not worried about that because I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0261,think that we both like like to have a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0262,conclusion you know we like it to to get
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0263,somewhere and so I don't think we leave
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0264,things open ended you know you know you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0265,don't like to go to bed without solving
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0266,whatever issues at hand
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0267,and I think that's a good way to be and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0268,I think we kind of do that regardless of
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0269,it's nighttime or daytime you know
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0270,wherever we are we want to make sure we
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0271,resolve whatever the thing it is we need
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0272,to talk about and usually we do so
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0273,pretty quickly because yeah we listen to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0274,each other and we figure it out oh you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0275,want me to yeah why not the biggest
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0276,challenge in our relationship um I think
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0277,that yeah well you talk about one aspect
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0278,I think for some ways we're going to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0279,we're gonna have to figure out how we
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0280,balance our you know ambitions as they
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0281,relate to you know creativity to our
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0282,careers to you know how we want to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0283,survive as as people and how that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0284,connects into our relationship and you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0285,know that that level of partnership as
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0286,well you know you talked about the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0287,intimacy you feel when we work together
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0288,and I feel - so that's a very exciting
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0289,thing but I I suspect maybe I'm just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0290,seeing about being anxious but I suspect
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0291,that the owners gonna be challenges
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0292,facing that as well and you know as we
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0293,try and find our place more yeah we're
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0294,still kind of both searching a bit so I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0295,think part of that challenge which
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0296,doesn't seem insurmountable seems like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0297,something we can definitely handle is
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0298,how how are we gonna move forward
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0299,together how are we gonna collectively
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0300,find go towards our ambitions and that's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0301,it's it's an exciting challenge in a way

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0303,probably the biggest thing we're gonna
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0304,have to deal with yeah yeah it's a biter
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0305,yeah

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0313,do this kind of thing just you know and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0314,together with all the other people
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0315,sitting in the theater sitting outside
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0316,the theater and I think they asked a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0317,question if yeah if you were - how would
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0318,you seduce me and in my mind was like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0319,okay so yeah how would I say this er
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0320,just like as we are and then you said
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0321,something and then I misinterpreted it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0322,as say like we don't know each other and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0323,then I'd you know you know yeah I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0324,attempted to do then that thing and then
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0325,I felt like I put myself like okay I'm

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0327,ish and I'm gonna do whatever ability to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0328,flirt that I have and then I felt at the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0329,time you guys shut it down because it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0330,wasn't what the actual assignment was so
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0331,what disappointed me was that I I felt
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0332,yeah I felt like you know I'm like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0333,almost as if I'm at like asking a girl
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0334,out to be like Roy and it bummed me out
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0335,but and then we got like into like a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0336,little argument right there in the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0337,moment which felt like it too obvious
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0338,which frustrated me as well like oh
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0339,great they got to us already yeah that's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0340,before we signed up for this thing and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0341,but we talked about it right then and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0342,there and you know he said you're sorry
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0343,and then I explained what I was going on
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0344,my hands and then we and we worked it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0345,out so that's it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0346,after all that gold you ever see her

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0350,we talked it through it was you know
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0351,obviously a minor thing but uh I guess I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0352,just felt vulnerable so you felt
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0353,disappointed though me yeah I was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0354,disappointed that I was disappointed
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0355,that I couldn't just you know play that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0356,game and disappointed that you work in a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0357,responds and I guess I'll wait it out
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0358,smashing noise I guess that's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0359,disappointed also yeah like disappointed

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0376,frustrated or being angry being
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0377,disappointed is like yeah letting
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0378,someone down and you know that that's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0379,like the that's the hardest thing for me
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0380,it's like let myself roll let people
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0381,down so
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0382,you you disappointed me yeah now that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0383,you've explained how serious honestly I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0384,can't think of okay when you came to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0385,Istanbul to visit and I felt like you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0386,know you I had to work the day that you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0387,arrived and you're flying all the way
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0388,from Amsterdam and it was the first time
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0389,we'd be seeing each other after meeting
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0390,here and then me going back home to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0391,Istanbul and you weren't sure what you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0392,were going to do the whole first day
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0393,because there'd be no way for me to let
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0394,you into my apartment you wouldn't know
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0395,where it was and I had to work until
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0396,like 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. so I created this
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0397,whole plan for you so you would have
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0398,like interesting things to see in places
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0399,to go and you wouldn't feel so lost in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0400,such a city of chaos and I made this old
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0401,book and I talked to all these different
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0402,cafes and I I planned like different
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0403,routes for you and like different games
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0404,for you to play and I drew photos and I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0405,drew a map and and then you showed up
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0406,and you're like oh my friends picking me
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0407,up so I'll see you later and I'm gonna
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0408,stay with him for the first couple days
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0409,and that like really really disappointed
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0410,me because I felt like I was so excited
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0411,to see you and I put so much effort into
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0412,yeah you know like a high school project
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0413,you know but I like I really put on my
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0414,heart into this and then you're just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0415,like yeah yeah my friends picking me up
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0416,I'm gonna go stay in this like fancy
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0417,area of the city I'll see you in a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0418,couple days yeah okay I don't think I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0419,stayed there a couple days really
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0420,that's two days the first two days
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0421,[Laughter]
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0422,what is something I could have done to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0423,support you during the abortion I think
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0424,I think he did a pretty good job
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0425,supporting me I think it would have been
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0426,you know I was I was mostly nervous
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0427,about interacting with the doctors that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0428,would that was my biggest concern you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0429,know of course I honestly it wasn't as
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0430,emotional about making that big choice
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0431,as I think it is for a lot of people it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0432,wasn't as hard for me I knew the choice
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0433,that I wanted to make and that probably
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0434,was best for us as well obviously it was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0435,best for us but yeah I knew that I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0436,wanted to have an abortion so that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0437,wasn't a big decision but for going to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0438,the intake appointment by myself and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0439,then having to make the decision do I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0440,take the pill or you know do I come back
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0441,and have a surgery and am I fully under
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0442,or do I just do it with like local
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0443,anesthesia you know like what and -
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0444,making these choices that was really
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0445,hard for me and having that doctor who
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0446,wasn't very nice and you know that that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0447,makes me like really emotional
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0448,more so vivid than anything else feeling
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0449,vulnerable already and then being by
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0450,myself and not having that support I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0451,know you had to work but it was it was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0452,hard and then what you weren't there or
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0453,something oh your friends were in town
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0454,that was the week before yeah your
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0455,friends were in town but I still like I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0456,went and got tested to make sure that I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0457,was they did the ultrasound to make sure
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0458,I was actually pregnant okay they're in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0459,the same time this day your friends
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0460,arrived and you you wanted me to no no
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0461,no I do the pregnancy I took the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0462,pregnancy test yeah
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0463,and then they were arriving like an
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0464,authority but the moment that your best
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0465,friends were arriving into town and you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0466,kind of had encouraged me to take it and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0467,then you went and hung out with them and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0468,I was by myself at home like taking this
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0469,pregnancy test and I just felt like you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0470,know maybe didn't realize like how how
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0471,emotional that would be yeah I remember
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0472,that conversation I mean I understand I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0473,understand why you felt that I was
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0474,encouraging it at the time I thought
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0475,about this obviously recently and what
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0476,would have had been if you had waited a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0477,few days and then taking it like you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0478,know schrödinger's pregnancy or
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0479,something like what would have it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0480,changed the dynamic wise I just remember
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0481,being on the phone with you and you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0482,saying that you got the you got the test
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0483,or something and what I recall I said
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0484,like you know if you want to decide to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0485,take it now that's sure if not that's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0486,okay too
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0487,your probably sensed because you know me
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0488,that I like knowing things right away so
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0489,you felt that encouragement I think you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0490,said I would rather you take the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0491,pregnancy test now
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0492,why would why would we need to wait and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0493,for me it was a matter of whether I'm
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0494,pregnant or not it is what it is at
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0495,least we can wait a couple days until
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0496,your friends leave your best friends
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0497,that you haven't seen in years yeah and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0498,and you were kind of like let's just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0499,let's just figure it out now let's just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0500,know and that is one big difference
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0501,between you rather just like no now no
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0502,matter what and me it's like well it is
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0503,what it is let's just like wait wait to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0504,open the box sure neighbor's cat or
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0505,whatever but okay but I think yeah just
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0506,just being a little more present and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0507,then you did end up staying the next day
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0508,with me after the day I had the abortion
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0509,you stayed with me but then the next day
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0510,you were kind of just you were gonna go
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0511,do something else with some friends
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0512,you're gonna meet up with friends and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0513,you go you're okay and I told you like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0514,I'm not okay like I know that I seem
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0515,okay but I need your hair and you didn't
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0516,you stayed
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0517,so that you didn't provide the support
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0518,that I needed yeah because it was hard
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0519,to read sometimes exactly what you're
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0520,you know because yeah like you said it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0521,wasn't it didn't have the stereotypical
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0522,kind of emotional white that you know
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0523,like whoa well one sided are we playing
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0524,every like making not to make it too
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0525,much of a big deal are we gonna push the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0526,side it's like oh you know this is what
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0527,it is we'll move on or like oh my god
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0528,let's individual yeah so trying to find

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0599,what do you think I'm missing out by
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0600,being with you well I mean you're you're
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0601,younger than me you're 25 yes yes I am
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0602,age doesn't matter it's just a number
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0603,right 17 you're 25 and I'm 29 and I I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0604,feel like I've lived 10 lives you know I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0605,feel so lucky to have been able to live
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0606,in so many places and do so many things
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0607,and and have adventures and meet amazing
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0608,people and things I know you've done as
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0609,well but I feel like I've had more
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0610,opportunities to do so just because I'm
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0611,older and you know sometimes I find
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0612,myself saying when I was your age and I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0613,don't mean it in that like I'm older
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0614,sort of way but like I'm like oh yeah
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0615,when I was 25 I was living in Istanbul I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0616,was doing this I was Anna and I feel
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0617,like sometimes being with me and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0618,settling down is somehow might limit you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0619,and in whatever way that means and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0620,however that turns out and I I don't
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0621,ever want to limit you like I love you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0622,and all I want is for you to be happy
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0623,and to grow and to learn and and to be
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0624,able to witness those changes and and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0625,growth and I I don't know what I would
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0626,do if I found out I was limiting you in
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0627,some way that I would just break my
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0628,heart so I I hope that I never do and I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0629,hope that that the way that we are
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0630,together just continues to encourage
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0631,growth and change and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0632,that can be limitless you know I'm not
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0633,I'm so not worried about your limiting
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0634,me in any way I mean what what what's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0635,exciting for me and what I love also
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0636,about being with you is that I if
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0637,anything you're just going to encourage
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0638,more experiences for me yeah that idea
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0639,of settling down or that I'll be limited
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0640,because I'm with maybe it was a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0641,different partner if it was someone else
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0642,who is more set and doesn't have an
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0643,interest in growth or expanding that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0644,would be a different question you know
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0645,that age difference because it's with
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0646,you there's someone I think who is going
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0647,to pull the best out of me so if I I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0648,know I'm not gonna miss out on anything
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0649,being with you it's gonna just help me
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0650,get more okay I'm glad you feel that way
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0651,yeah
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0652,looking back do you wish you'd proposed
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0653,why or why not
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0654,[Laughter]
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0655,I was because because you know as you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0656,know you know our first discussion is
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0657,this idea we had these conversations
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0658,about the idea of marriage before and
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0659,you had expressed in so many terms that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0660,not for you yeah marriage whatever some
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0661,bullshit patriarchy system that's good
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0662,but there's no need for it so I kind of
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0663,I think I resigned to the idea like okay
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0664,that's that's what that is
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0665,you know that's not something that's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0666,necessary for me to have a relationship
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0667,with her so when you did propose to me
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0668,it's and make it had to make me it's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0669,like it's gonna look that back-and-forth
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0670,almost like if I was I was up it was a
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0671,you know so in the moment as well so on
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0672,the moment of like a heightened
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0673,experience of like us being outs and you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0674,know traveling and being with friends
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0675,and having a great time and then like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0676,you said I want to marry you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0677,that it almost was difficult to like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0678,process it at once like is this for real
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0679,is this you know a sincere and truthful
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0680,moment right here and there you didn't
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0681,believe it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0682,no I of course but you know you always
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0683,sincere about these things it's not like
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0684,you ever take those things back it's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0685,just it was a low is hard to reconcile
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0686,with what I had thoughts your ideology
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0687,was before which is why I said yes but
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0688,let's I want to ask you again the next
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0689,day to make sure
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0690,I don't regret not being the one to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0691,propose I like the fact that there's
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0692,this yeah and the role reversal of its I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0693,enjoy that I don't know I'll be honest I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0694,don't know if I would have asked myself
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0695,as soon as you asked me I think if I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0696,were the one who's like oh you know the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0697,guy I'm going to ask at some point it
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0698,probably would have been at a different
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0699,points and I've probably been more I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0700,want to have been more of a thing to
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0701,some degree not like it would have been
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0702,more of a thing I just did a little bit
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0703,no no no need a no flash my house or
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0704,whatever nonsense no fancy restaurant
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0705,dinners okay it's like inside the
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0706,chocolate tarts are but I imagine I
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0707,would have been like ha you know how am
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0708,I gonna ask it and do I deal with a ring
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0709,I partner I think it would I would I

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0711,with that I yeah that's kind of like all

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0716,honestly if you had asked I I don't I

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0719,feelings about marriage you know mm-hmm
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0720,you're like oh oh she'll just she'll

Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0723,marriage well it would have been true
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0724,yes but I had to come to that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0725,realization on my own I would have felt
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0726,like it was forced upon me by you
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0727,putting me on the spot like that
Man014_Woman014_Transcription_0728,mm-hm I think I don't know who knows but
