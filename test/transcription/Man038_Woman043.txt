Man038_Woman043_0001,yeah as well yes alright so just yeah
Man038_Woman043_0002,shouldn't take a look you know looking
Man038_Woman043_0003,Chili's eyes for 30 40 seconds then when
Man038_Woman043_0004,you feel ready just take the first card
Man038_Woman043_0005,but do you remember about the first time
Man038_Woman043_0006,we met okay I remember everything I
Man038_Woman043_0007,remember what I was wearing I don't know
Man038_Woman043_0008,what you were wearing I remember that I
Man038_Woman043_0009,was insanely nervous and I thought you
Man038_Woman043_0010,weren't going to like the way that I
Man038_Woman043_0011,looked I remember that we kissed like
Man038_Woman043_0012,five minutes after we met in person and
Man038_Woman043_0013,then I remember us waiting for the bus
Man038_Woman043_0014,to the city because we were in Long
Man038_Woman043_0015,Island and we were just sitting on the
Man038_Woman043_0016,grass and a beautiful Indian woman ran
Man038_Woman043_0017,across the street to give us money I
Man038_Woman043_0018,don't know why she did that and we were
Man038_Woman043_0019,like no you don't need the money yeah I
Man038_Woman043_0020,remember that whole day almost exactly
Man038_Woman043_0021,all right see okay so what do you love
Man038_Woman043_0022,about our relationship
Man038_Woman043_0023,I love that you see me at my best and at
Man038_Woman043_0024,my worst and you accept me except you
Man038_Woman043_0025,accept parts of me that even I don't
Man038_Woman043_0026,accept and that I don't think are worthy
Man038_Woman043_0027,of acceptance and that's really
Man038_Woman043_0028,empowering and it's really meaningful I
Man038_Woman043_0029,also love that I I've never I don't
Man038_Woman043_0030,think I've ever spoken to anyone as
Man038_Woman043_0031,freely as I have with you and I've like
Man038_Woman043_0032,told you things I've never told anybody
Man038_Woman043_0033,before
Man038_Woman043_0034,you know things about me I like nobody
Man038_Woman043_0035,knows and I think it says a lot because
Man038_Woman043_0036,it's like you know like you still love
Man038_Woman043_0037,me you still care about me even after
Man038_Woman043_0038,knowing all these things so it's like
Man038_Woman043_0039,maybe it just sort of shows me that
Man038_Woman043_0040,maybe I should be easier on myself when
Man038_Woman043_0041,do you feel closest to me closest at
Man038_Woman043_0042,nighttime in our own space like our room
Man038_Woman043_0043,I feel like it's our time and it's just
Man038_Woman043_0044,it's so easy and natural as opposed to
Man038_Woman043_0045,like when we're in the middle of like
Man038_Woman043_0046,day-to-day activities and we're busy and
Man038_Woman043_0047,you know we have to do things like
Man038_Woman043_0048,obligations I don't feel like we're on
Man038_Woman043_0049,the same page but like at night time
Man038_Woman043_0050,when we're alone and it's just less to
Man038_Woman043_0051,you with our music and like all of our
Man038_Woman043_0052,stuff and our books then I just feel
Man038_Woman043_0053,like it's like me and you time and we
Man038_Woman043_0054,really connect and it's like not even
Man038_Woman043_0055,like we're two bodies anymore like at
Man038_Woman043_0056,nighttime it's just like we're always
Man038_Woman043_0057,like just like on the same exact page
Man038_Woman043_0058,being together talking and laughing
Man038_Woman043_0059,all right so why am I your primary
Man038_Woman043_0060,partner
Man038_Woman043_0061,because I feel like even though we met
Man038_Woman043_0062,in our 20s
Man038_Woman043_0063,I feel like hey I have this strange
Man038_Woman043_0064,sense as if like we've been growing up
Man038_Woman043_0065,together our entire lives I feel like
Man038_Woman043_0066,we're still growing up together and so
Man038_Woman043_0067,it's like that shared process that
Man038_Woman043_0068,shared experience
Man038_Woman043_0069,I like transforming together it's not
Man038_Woman043_0070,like when you meet someone and it's like
Man038_Woman043_0071,you're a specific person you're a
Man038_Woman043_0072,specific person and then you change the
Man038_Woman043_0073,relationship falls apart it's like we
Man038_Woman043_0074,were continually in this process of
Man038_Woman043_0075,transformation throughout the route of
Man038_Woman043_0076,course the relationship and I feel like
Man038_Woman043_0077,that's really like that's really
Man038_Woman043_0078,powerful and that's really even though
Man038_Woman043_0079,it's based in change it's still very
Man038_Woman043_0080,stable because it's sort of like we
Man038_Woman043_0081,changed together
Man038_Woman043_0082,what do you hesitant to tell me I don't
Man038_Woman043_0083,know not many things I think I tell you
Man038_Woman043_0084,everything like not everything but like
Man038_Woman043_0085,hard get a real job

Man038_Woman043_0090,when I feel like we're not like living
Man038_Woman043_0091,up to that I guess I feel like if I tell
Man038_Woman043_0092,you that that you'll like because you
Man038_Woman043_0093,are really hard on yourself
Man038_Woman043_0094,I just don't want you to like beat

Man038_Woman043_0096,know I like want to protect your
Man038_Woman043_0097,feelings I guess so if I'm ever hesitant
Man038_Woman043_0098,till I tell you anything it's not
Man038_Woman043_0099,because like I'm ashamed that's because
Man038_Woman043_0100,I want to protect you
Man038_Woman043_0101,I don't want to like hurt you it's like
Man038_Woman043_0102,whenever you're hurting it like hurts me

Man038_Woman043_0104,hurts a lot don't when I see you okay so

Man038_Woman043_0138,the lousy estava in the world I don't
Man038_Woman043_0139,even think I would be able to see that

Man038_Woman043_0142,every time I'm like the sex I had before
Man038_Woman043_0143,you was like freakish and really abusive
Man038_Woman043_0144,in a weird way and like manipulative so
Man038_Woman043_0145,it's a hands down you're definitely the
Man038_Woman043_0146,best sex and a rad okay
Man038_Woman043_0147,where do you think I may fail you you
Man038_Woman043_0148,haven't failed me yet
Man038_Woman043_0149,but if you can like you know forecast
Man038_Woman043_0150,like is there any I feel like I know
Man038_Woman043_0151,where I could fail you like I don't know
Man038_Woman043_0152,what do you think it is I think that I
Man038_Woman043_0153,don't practice like enough for you and I
Man038_Woman043_0154,mean like I don't like I'm not on such
Man038_Woman043_0155,like a vigorous like spiritual path like
Man038_Woman043_0156,you're very dedicated and I just haven't
Man038_Woman043_0157,found that dedication and I haven't
Man038_Woman043_0158,found like my own personal practice so I
Man038_Woman043_0159,love yoga and I love what it's
Man038_Woman043_0160,introduced to my life but I'm not as
Man038_Woman043_0161,dedicated as you are and I feel like
Man038_Woman043_0162,sometimes you think that I don't know
Man038_Woman043_0163,like I feel like if if you had to name
Man038_Woman043_0164,any of like my like shortcomings it'd be
Man038_Woman043_0165,like she's she doesn't meditate enough
Man038_Woman043_0166,she's not doing that she's not working
Man038_Woman043_0167,on herself internally enough you know
Man038_Woman043_0168,like to your standards because you have
Man038_Woman043_0169,really high standards as far as like
Man038_Woman043_0170,spiritual path and your practice your
Man038_Woman043_0171,daily practice and yoga and your
Man038_Woman043_0172,meditation and I feel like that's
Man038_Woman043_0173,amazing for you but it's like I feel
Man038_Woman043_0174,like sometimes I don't live up to your
Man038_Woman043_0175,expectations when it comes to that
Man038_Woman043_0176,I mean I wouldn't define that I was
Man038_Woman043_0177,failing me but yeah I mean that's
Man038_Woman043_0178,something that I kind of crapola not
Man038_Woman043_0179,because I feel like anybody has to do
Man038_Woman043_0180,what I do like this is my life that's
Man038_Woman043_0181,what I'm doing for my own evolution but
Man038_Woman043_0182,I guess sometimes it would be nice to be
Man038_Woman043_0183,able to relate that aspect of my life
Man038_Woman043_0184,more with the person who I spend so much
Man038_Woman043_0185,of my time with but at the same time I'm
Man038_Woman043_0186,also aware that that's not just
Man038_Woman043_0187,something like it's not just you it's me
Man038_Woman043_0188,too like I need to have a more like
Man038_Woman043_0189,balanced and relaxed attitude about sort
Man038_Woman043_0190,of meddling other people's I guess
Man038_Woman043_0191,growth that's someone with my job right
Man038_Woman043_0192,and that could all be energy going
Man038_Woman043_0193,towards like intensifying my own work
Man038_Woman043_0194,even more so yeah I mean I apologize for
Man038_Woman043_0195,being a jerk about that you're not a
Man038_Woman043_0196,jerk
Man038_Woman043_0197,oh who asked last question you know are
Man038_Woman043_0198,you sure what are you scared to tell me
Man038_Woman043_0199,what am I scared to tell you
Man038_Woman043_0200,Pass I do idea that the tracks for our
Man038_Woman043_0201,relationship what do you do that the
Man038_Woman043_0202,tracks from our relationship I would say
Man038_Woman043_0203,like the biggest thing is like the
Man038_Woman043_0204,communication and we dealt with that
Man038_Woman043_0205,today like you're so like focused inward
Man038_Woman043_0206,so much of the time I think that it's
Man038_Woman043_0207,just like not a priority to a priority
Man038_Woman043_0208,for you to like express yourself to me
Man038_Woman043_0209,whereas like my priority all the time
Man038_Woman043_0210,it's like tell you how I'm feeling like
Man038_Woman043_0211,let's talk about it let's talk about it
Man038_Woman043_0212,and you're not that way you were and you
Man038_Woman043_0213,like let things like bubble up inside
Man038_Woman043_0214,you and I feel like if our communication
Man038_Woman043_0215,were on point and we were expressing all
Man038_Woman043_0216,over you know just just like laying
Man038_Woman043_0217,everything out in the open like our
Man038_Woman043_0218,relationship would feel a lot more
Man038_Woman043_0219,stable
Man038_Woman043_0220,not that it's unstable by any means but
Man038_Woman043_0221,I feel like if anything um could like
Man038_Woman043_0222,really it's just like your lack of
Man038_Woman043_0223,communication and I just like feel like
Man038_Woman043_0224,that's like the most important thing to
Man038_Woman043_0225,like a relationship like it's just good
Man038_Woman043_0226,really good communication like so many
Man038_Woman043_0227,issues that we have on a day to day
Man038_Woman043_0228,basis can be avoided if we just like
Man038_Woman043_0229,talked about it you know instead of like
Man038_Woman043_0230,making assumptions or just like being I
Man038_Woman043_0231,don't know I feel like you do it not
Man038_Woman043_0232,even like you're not even conscious of
Man038_Woman043_0233,it like you don't know that you're not
Man038_Woman043_0234,talking to me you know what I mean and I
Man038_Woman043_0235,just feel like a lot of times I just
Man038_Woman043_0236,feel like left out of the loop like what
Man038_Woman043_0237,is going on like I don't know because
Man038_Woman043_0238,he's not telling me so if anything it's
Man038_Woman043_0239,really just like talking more even about
Man038_Woman043_0240,like the mundane shit like just that's
Man038_Woman043_0241,what like people you see each other
Man038_Woman043_0242,everything
Man038_Woman043_0243,all day like they're gonna talk about
Man038_Woman043_0244,like really petty shit sometimes and I
Man038_Woman043_0245,feel like you're really scared to do
Man038_Woman043_0246,that like you constantly want to be look
Man038_Woman043_0247,at this really like really heavy really
Man038_Woman043_0248,deep intense like place all the time and
Man038_Woman043_0249,like sometimes I'm just don't want to be
Man038_Woman043_0250,there I want to like you know it's it
Man038_Woman043_0251,doesn't always have to be there so just
Man038_Woman043_0252,a communication and talking to me more
Man038_Woman043_0253,why did you get jealous last time and
Man038_Woman043_0254,how did you feel was the last time I was
Man038_Woman043_0255,jealous I don't know you tell me no
Man038_Woman043_0256,you're not you've never been jealous in
Man038_Woman043_0257,the last three years not to memory not
Man038_Woman043_0258,like in a serious way like well that's
Man038_Woman043_0259,there's not there's different levels of
Man038_Woman043_0260,jealousy like that's how it works so
Man038_Woman043_0261,even like at the shallowest level Oh
Man038_Woman043_0262,like when was the last time and why I
Man038_Woman043_0263,guess I may be like the first new years
Man038_Woman043_0264,have you ever had together we were at
Man038_Woman043_0265,two different parties but they were like
Man038_Woman043_0266,right next door to each other
Man038_Woman043_0267,and you have like hooked up with someone
Man038_Woman043_0268,and it was like in retrospect though
Man038_Woman043_0269,like I don't even feel like my like
Man038_Woman043_0270,being upset about it was really for a
Man038_Woman043_0271,valid reason like yeah well that's how
Man038_Woman043_0272,jealousy works like in many ways like
Man038_Woman043_0273,jealousy is can come from a very like a
Man038_Woman043_0274,rational place like it's like why are
Man038_Woman043_0275,you jealous I know just jealous it's
Man038_Woman043_0276,like enough feeling that just like keeps
Man038_Woman043_0277,up on you I guess I felt as if like you
Man038_Woman043_0278,perhaps like this other person was like
Man038_Woman043_0279,or other people are more fun than to be
Man038_Woman043_0280,around me you have more fun being out
Man038_Woman043_0281,with others than me but it's like I feel
Man038_Woman043_0282,like that was a very foolish place to be
Man038_Woman043_0283,in and that's why I kind of let it go
Man038_Woman043_0284,fairly quickly
Man038_Woman043_0285,I also think that it was also cuz I was
Man038_Woman043_0286,with another person too
Man038_Woman043_0287,it's like I had like the bad influence
Man038_Woman043_0288,of their own like interpretation on the
Man038_Woman043_0289,six on the situation especially coming
Man038_Woman043_0290,from a more conservative of monogamous
Man038_Woman043_0291,point of view it's like it made it seem
Man038_Woman043_0292,as if it was more of a problem than it
Man038_Woman043_0293,is but it really wasn't a problem from a
Man038_Woman043_0294,polyamorous point of view or from my own
Man038_Woman043_0295,point of view so it's sort of like you
Man038_Woman043_0296,have very it's like if I have a very
Man038_Woman043_0297,weak sort of reaction to something and
Man038_Woman043_0298,then somebody else is like adding like
Man038_Woman043_0299,mom like gas to the fire oh yeah it was
Man038_Woman043_0300,kind of like that so it's even there
Man038_Woman043_0301,like that's why I cuz it's like that was
Man038_Woman043_0302,really the one time that I felt really
Man038_Woman043_0303,jealous in the relationship and even
Man038_Woman043_0304,there it's like I wasn't that big a deal
Man038_Woman043_0305,someone else was me I remember that time
Man038_Woman043_0306,that night and it felt like a big deal
Man038_Woman043_0307,and I cried a lot and that's what I'm
Man038_Woman043_0308,saying like that's how the community
Man038_Woman043_0309,communication comes in if we would have
Man038_Woman043_0310,talked about it like like you were just
Man038_Woman043_0311,pissed and jealous but you don't want to
Man038_Woman043_0312,talk about it if we talked about it I
Man038_Woman043_0313,feel like that whole thing could have
Man038_Woman043_0314,just been like a lot better we could
Man038_Woman043_0315,have been a bit at the same time it's
Man038_Woman043_0316,like if I were to talk about it and I
Man038_Woman043_0317,were to express the emotions that I'm
Man038_Woman043_0318,later going to renounce then it's sort
Man038_Woman043_0319,of like I made a big mess out of
Man038_Woman043_0320,something that was really yeah I could
Man038_Woman043_0321,have just processed it
Man038_Woman043_0322,that's what jealousy does and that's why
Man038_Woman043_0323,you need to work your it and I'm also
Man038_Woman043_0324,very cautious to say things I don't mean
Man038_Woman043_0325,so it's like if I'm feeling a certain
Man038_Woman043_0326,way and I know that I'm just in being in
Man038_Woman043_0327,my emotions and if I see it from a clear
Man038_Woman043_0328,point of view later well I say something
Man038_Woman043_0329,I'm going to regret when I could just be
Man038_Woman043_0330,silent about it process it and then like
Man038_Woman043_0331,express it like I already process
Man038_Woman043_0332,instead of an it's rock I don't messy
Man038_Woman043_0333,and egotistical for him but you're right
Man038_Woman043_0334,that I should communicate more thank you
Man038_Woman043_0335,what kind of sexual acts do you do with
Man038_Woman043_0336,other partners that you don't do with me

Man038_Woman043_0339,there's not like like you know like the
Man038_Woman043_0340,typical like love making scenes like
Man038_Woman043_0341,with other partners it's not like you
Man038_Woman043_0342,know r.kelly and like you name it's like
Man038_Woman043_0343,Rico it's like really raw and nasty I'm
Man038_Woman043_0344,like just really aggressive like I hate
Man038_Woman043_0345,you you mean it's like not you know yeah
Man038_Woman043_0346,it's just not really there's not like a
Man038_Woman043_0347,lot of love in it for the most part yeah
Man038_Woman043_0348,it's kind of shallow but that's why you
Man038_Woman043_0349,do it like that's that's my whole like
Man038_Woman043_0350,intention like having casual sex because
Man038_Woman043_0351,it is shallow and like there's like just
Man038_Woman043_0352,this really feeling that I get from it
Man038_Woman043_0353,that's just like like I have something
Man038_Woman043_0354,so real with you like why would I want
Man038_Woman043_0355,to go and find that with someone else so
Man038_Woman043_0356,I can just have like really nasty
Man038_Woman043_0357,shallow sex and then not think about
Man038_Woman043_0358,that person and focus on us and then
Man038_Woman043_0359,whenever I'm craving that I just go out
Man038_Woman043_0360,and do that and I love having that
Man038_Woman043_0361,freedom
Man038_Woman043_0362,cool sex questions okay how is sex
Man038_Woman043_0363,different with your other partners than
Man038_Woman043_0364,it is with me
Man038_Woman043_0365,you just have to that's cool
Man038_Woman043_0366,I mean it's like you have different
Man038_Woman043_0367,dynamics of different people all right
Man038_Woman043_0368,and different people bring out different
Man038_Woman043_0369,parts of your personality and vice-versa
Man038_Woman043_0370,so I know I mean with one other person
Man038_Woman043_0371,it's like kind of more experimental
Man038_Woman043_0372,right because they're you know they've
Man038_Woman043_0373,they've worked with him like you know
Man038_Woman043_0374,various types of sex work and so on so
Man038_Woman043_0375,they've done lots of really crazy shit
Man038_Woman043_0376,but it's like I've never done before and
Man038_Woman043_0377,so each time it's like it's it's like
Man038_Woman043_0378,it's very experimental but it's not
Man038_Woman043_0379,necessarily like you mentioned before
Man038_Woman043_0380,like this whole kind of lovemaking deep
Man038_Woman043_0381,like intimate thing it's more like sort
Man038_Woman043_0382,of expanding my imagination in a way but
Man038_Woman043_0383,I don't like compare like say one is
Man038_Woman043_0384,better than the other or anything
Man038_Woman043_0385,because it's different dynamics and it's
Man038_Woman043_0386,also a different level of intimacy right
Man038_Woman043_0387,but he could change one thing in our
Man038_Woman043_0388,relationship but would it be and why
Man038_Woman043_0389,okay
Man038_Woman043_0390,I would change our living situation I
Man038_Woman043_0391,want to live as far away from my family
Man038_Woman043_0392,as possible I want to be somewhere warm
Man038_Woman043_0393,and I want us to have like her own place
Man038_Woman043_0394,like legitimate like our own we worked
Man038_Woman043_0395,for it we built it up from the bottom I
Man038_Woman043_0396,want us to start preparing to like
Man038_Woman043_0397,expand our family and like living in an
Man038_Woman043_0398,attic like it's a bummer especially like
Man038_Woman043_0399,my family is so intrusive I feel like
Man038_Woman043_0400,when you're like a plant and you're like
Man038_Woman043_0401,in a pot that's too small for you like I
Man038_Woman043_0402,feel like we're two plants and our pots
Man038_Woman043_0403,but our pots like about to like explode
Man038_Woman043_0404,because we're like trying to grow so
Man038_Woman043_0405,hard I just feel like it's thumbs are
Man038_Woman043_0406,growth a lot and like I know that like
Man038_Woman043_0407,in a way like everything and is our in
Man038_Woman043_0408,our life right now like in some way or
Man038_Woman043_0409,another we're choosing it like we're
Man038_Woman043_0410,letting it happen you know what I mean
Man038_Woman043_0411,so I can't like play the victim and be
Man038_Woman043_0412,like look how did I end up here no I
Man038_Woman043_0413,know exactly where like I am and how I
Man038_Woman043_0414,got here but if I can just like
Man038_Woman043_0415,magically like smack my fingers and be

Man038_Woman043_0421,that's like where I'm at you know that's
Man038_Woman043_0422,what I would really love
Man038_Woman043_0423,who has more power in the relationship
Man038_Woman043_0424,you or me um I think people have power
Man038_Woman043_0425,over ourselves so it's like you have I
Man038_Woman043_0426,suppose like infinite power of yourself
Man038_Woman043_0427,and I have infinite power over myself I
Man038_Woman043_0428,try not to reproduce these kind of like
Man038_Woman043_0429,really kind of patriarchal like I try
Man038_Woman043_0430,not to own you like but that's also part
Man038_Woman043_0431,of what like like my polyamory comes
Man038_Woman043_0432,from - like I try not to be possessive
Man038_Woman043_0433,and I try not to like only or treat you
Man038_Woman043_0434,as if like you're like my thing or
Man038_Woman043_0435,something so I mean I ideally like I try
Man038_Woman043_0436,to keep it equal in the sense that I
Man038_Woman043_0437,have power over myself you have power
Man038_Woman043_0438,over yourself and it's more like two
Man038_Woman043_0439,autonomous beings choosing to interact
Man038_Woman043_0440,in this way than like me having like
Man038_Woman043_0441,found you grabbed you and made you mine
Man038_Woman043_0442,or something I agree what do you think

Man038_Woman043_0446,been three years like we've been
Man038_Woman043_0447,fighting

Man038_Woman043_0482,building you mean so that's what I

Man038_Woman043_0488,parts of yourself that you're afraid of
Man038_Woman043_0489,being don't and also see women as people
Man038_Woman043_0490,exactly like herself
Man038_Woman043_0491,because I feel like a lot of the fear
Man038_Woman043_0492,and tire that I felt growing up around
Man038_Woman043_0493,other women was because like for some
Man038_Woman043_0494,reason I didn't make this connection
Man038_Woman043_0495,they were human beings that perhaps be
Man038_Woman043_0496,as afraid as I am or feel the same kinds
Man038_Woman043_0497,of like you know emotions and so on like
Man038_Woman043_0498,I saw them as these like almost
Man038_Woman043_0499,otherworldly types of like figures that
Man038_Woman043_0500,I had to like prove myself to or
Man038_Woman043_0501,something so just say see them as people
Man038_Woman043_0502,like yourself respect their autonomy
Man038_Woman043_0503,respect your own autonomy and yeah just
Man038_Woman043_0504,just be human you know
Man038_Woman043_0505,and also like don't don't ever don't
Man038_Woman043_0506,ever make you're like don't ever have
Man038_Woman043_0507,your whole sense of self worth like rely
Man038_Woman043_0508,on the approval of one particular person
Man038_Woman043_0509,or like a woman or a man if they're into
Man038_Woman043_0510,matter whatever like but love yourself

Man038_Woman043_0513,come by you don't have to perform this
Man038_Woman043_0514,sort of notion of like what a man is
Man038_Woman043_0515,supposed to be in order to attract
Man038_Woman043_0516,someone because you think that that's
Man038_Woman043_0517,all that all women want is if all women
Man038_Woman043_0518,want the same thing alright so just be
Man038_Woman043_0519,yourself and the people it'll die with

Man038_Woman043_0528,know what I mean yeah that's like we
Man038_Woman043_0529,have cult right now right and I was
Man038_Woman043_0530,afraid of men because they were strong
Man038_Woman043_0531,and scary and like my mom would bring
Man038_Woman043_0532,men into the house that were scary and
Man038_Woman043_0533,they would get drunk and they would be
Man038_Woman043_0534,violent you know what I mean so I guess
Man038_Woman043_0535,like there's like I don't even know
Man038_Woman043_0536,where to start there's so much
Man038_Woman043_0537,you mean like there's there's so much
Man038_Woman043_0538,and it has to start from like such a
Man038_Woman043_0539,young age or like learn martial arts

Man038_Woman043_0548,boyfriend a few didn't you know like

Man038_Woman043_0562,like but like if men
Man038_Woman043_0563,track to queue or you're not doing
Man038_Woman043_0564,something to attract a man like it's

Man038_Woman043_0566,to attract men right if you're not doing
Man038_Woman043_0567,that job well then you're basically
Man038_Woman043_0568,worthless in the society like that's
Man038_Woman043_0569,like the message that was like drilled
Man038_Woman043_0570,into me like you're not girly enough
Man038_Woman043_0571,you're not wearing enough dresses you're
Man038_Woman043_0572,dude you're doing this all wrong
Man038_Woman043_0573,you may mean I'm like that was so much
Man038_Woman043_0574,like instead of focusing on that for so
Man038_Woman043_0575,long like I could I could have been
Man038_Woman043_0576,focused on like some real shit like that
Man038_Woman043_0577,stuff does not matter you need me and

Man038_Woman043_0588,just like I would just say like focus on
Man038_Woman043_0589,yourself first I mean like make
Man038_Woman043_0590,decisions because you genuinely believe
Man038_Woman043_0591,that that's the right thing to do don't

Man038_Woman043_0593,your legs or you know dress a certain
Man038_Woman043_0594,way because your friends or the
Man038_Woman043_0595,television are telling you that's what's
Man038_Woman043_0596,going to get a man I like a man's
Man038_Woman043_0597,attention
Man038_Woman043_0598,you know because relationships that are
Man038_Woman043_0599,based on that or not genuine you know
Man038_Woman043_0600,like they're not and um that's just like
Man038_Woman043_0601,really important like just I want my
Man038_Woman043_0602,daughter to be have like really high
Man038_Woman043_0603,self-worth because I grew up with really
Man038_Woman043_0604,low self-worth and that was because I
Man038_Woman043_0605,was fat and guys don't like me and now I
Man038_Woman043_0606,look back and it's like really that's
Man038_Woman043_0607,that's why that's so sad like it's so

Man038_Woman043_0609,dwelling on that
Man038_Woman043_0610,be ass like that was stuck it was just
Man038_Woman043_0611,like utter bullshit and I feel like that

Man038_Woman043_0618,I mean we've discussed this already
Man038_Woman043_0619,everybody imagines no okay you are
Man038_Woman043_0620,always talking about like our inner
Man038_Woman043_0621,child and like how you parent your own
Man038_Woman043_0622,air tiles I feel like I sometimes and
Man038_Woman043_0623,like overly mothering towards you I'm
Man038_Woman043_0624,like I wanted to take care of you and I
Man038_Woman043_0625,do it like naturally like it's like an
Man038_Woman043_0626,instinct because I love something I want
Man038_Woman043_0627,to take care of it right and then but at
Man038_Woman043_0628,the same time like I do all these small
Man038_Woman043_0629,things like I'm calm I'm like constantly
Man038_Woman043_0630,like not like catering to you but like
Man038_Woman043_0631,trying to accommodate your needs but you
Man038_Woman043_0632,don't see it your name mean and it's
Man038_Woman043_0633,like at the same time as it's uneven the
Man038_Woman043_0634,point I'm not doing it to get your
Man038_Woman043_0635,attention I'm doing it because I love
Man038_Woman043_0636,you you know but if there's like any way

Man038_Woman043_0680,you are you can be I'm sorry like sword
Man038_Woman043_0681,insensitive without realizing it like
Man038_Woman043_0682,I'm extremely sensitive person like I am
Man038_Woman043_0683,overly sensitive like I'm very emotional
Man038_Woman043_0684,and again balance like at the same time
Man038_Woman043_0685,like maybe it's a good thing that you're
Man038_Woman043_0686,not like who would balance me out when
Man038_Woman043_0687,I'm like freaking out inside or having
Man038_Woman043_0688,an emotional like you know like today I
Man038_Woman043_0689,was so hungry and cranky and tired and
Man038_Woman043_0690,if you were just as sensitive as I was
Man038_Woman043_0691,we would have both been like bratty and
Man038_Woman043_0692,shitty towards each other but no it was
Man038_Woman043_0693,like I was being a brows being a baby
Man038_Woman043_0694,and I was like complaining all day and
Man038_Woman043_0695,you just weren't having it you just like
Man038_Woman043_0696,you were just like you I guess that's
Man038_Woman043_0697,like the bout you you were calm and
Man038_Woman043_0698,centered the whole time your name Ian so
Man038_Woman043_0699,if you were also like just as like
Man038_Woman043_0700,sensitive and in tune with my emotions
Man038_Woman043_0701,you would have been you know freaking
Man038_Woman043_0702,out also and that would have been no
Man038_Woman043_0703,good so I don't know maybe I should
Man038_Woman043_0704,appreciate the balance more do you have
Man038_Woman043_0705,anything you want to ask me
Man038_Woman043_0706,hmm I guess I just sometimes I wonder
Man038_Woman043_0707,like what your vision because I am very
Man038_Woman043_0708,specific with my vision for us and it's
Man038_Woman043_0709,like we don't have the same vision like
Man038_Woman043_0710,we need to like morph our visions to
Man038_Woman043_0711,make like one big vision you know I mean
Man038_Woman043_0712,like sometimes I wonder because you
Man038_Woman043_0713,don't talk about it like I'm always
Man038_Woman043_0714,telling you what I want for us and you
Man038_Woman043_0715,never tell me
Man038_Woman043_0716,so I guess I just wonder like what do
Man038_Woman043_0717,you want our future to look like
Man038_Woman043_0718,together I know that's a ginormous
Man038_Woman043_0719,question like I mean I do envision it
Man038_Woman043_0720,but at the same time it's one of those
Man038_Woman043_0721,things I mean this isn't this is not
Man038_Woman043_0722,I'll preface this by saying this is in
Man038_Woman043_0723,good relationship logic but it's like
Man038_Woman043_0724,it's one of those things where it's like
Man038_Woman043_0725,if you're trying to make something
Man038_Woman043_0726,happen like you don't talk about it you
Man038_Woman043_0727,just sort of go ahead and do it and you
Man038_Woman043_0728,sort of keep that vision alive inside of
Man038_Woman043_0729,yourself it's kind of like an esoteric
Man038_Woman043_0730,principle but it's like like you just
Man038_Woman043_0731,sort of like work on it you don't speak
Man038_Woman043_0732,it and then it manifests more quickly
Man038_Woman043_0733,than if you just like tell it and then
Man038_Woman043_0734,you know it's like subject to other
Man038_Woman043_0735,people's opinions and like all these
Man038_Woman043_0736,other things but that's bad relationship
Man038_Woman043_0737,logic you shouldn't keep your plans
Man038_Woman043_0738,secret they involved other people but
Man038_Woman043_0739,yeah so I suppose I should be less
Man038_Woman043_0740,secretive with you okay
Man038_Woman043_0741,that I liked you guys I said if you
Man038_Woman043_0742,learn anything I like didn't come up
Man038_Woman043_0743,they wasn't expected yeah I mean I
Man038_Woman043_0744,learned that I can get you to
Man038_Woman043_0745,communicate better by just sitting in
Man038_Woman043_0746,front of you with cameras around and
Man038_Woman043_0747,like just talking to you and asking you
Man038_Woman043_0748,questions
Man038_Woman043_0749,hey like didn't we have that time
Man038_Woman043_0750,machine idea time machine or we would
Man038_Woman043_0751,like record various aspects of our lives
Man038_Woman043_0752,through multiple mediums of art and then
Man038_Woman043_0753,save it as a time machine for after we
Man038_Woman043_0754,die is like a journey capsule yeah I was
Man038_Woman043_0755,like yeah so why not that like why not
Man038_Woman043_0756,actually record some of our a
Man038_Woman043_0757,conversation he's a good idea maybe we
Man038_Woman043_0758,should do that yeah that'd be a good
Man038_Woman043_0759,idea so I just learned I relearned what
Man038_Woman043_0760,that was good and I learned that on you
Man038_Woman043_0761,know I kid I could definitely
Man038_Woman043_0762,communicate a lot more a lot better I
Man038_Woman043_0763,learned that
Man038_Woman043_0764,yeah I think a lot of it's sort of
Man038_Woman043_0765,sensors remind that same thing you know
Man038_Woman043_0766,that I've closed myself off on some
Man038_Woman043_0767,level and I should be hoping that sort
Man038_Woman043_0768,of channel I learned that I need to be
Man038_Woman043_0769,more appreciative of who you are like
Man038_Woman043_0770,you're just your personality because
Man038_Woman043_0771,we're so different in that way
Man038_Woman043_0772,you mean and sometimes it bugs me but
Man038_Woman043_0773,like I should appreciate like who you
Man038_Woman043_0774,are exactly how you are you know they
Man038_Woman043_0775,mean except like how you can be Stern
Man038_Woman043_0776,and serious when I'm goofy and crazy you
Man038_Woman043_0777,know what I mean because I again like I
Man038_Woman043_0778,guess I learned that like one of the
Man038_Woman043_0779,most important things in our
Man038_Woman043_0780,relationship is our balance
