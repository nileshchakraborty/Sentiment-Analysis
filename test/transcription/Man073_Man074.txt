Man073_Man074_0517,time I suppose so interesting how late

Man073_Man074_0519,about why he you know did the things he
Man073_Man074_0520,did why did he hit me like why did he
Man073_Man074_0521,you know like why did he tell me I was

Man073_Man074_0527,things that make me feel like I wasn't
Man073_Man074_0528,worth anything you know and when I
Man073_Man074_0529,finally confronted him about why why did
Man073_Man074_0530,you do the things you you did to me you
Man073_Man074_0531,know and hearing him saying that that's
Man073_Man074_0532,something that his father did to him you
Man073_Man074_0533,know this is a generation thing and you
Man073_Man074_0534,know and I told I was like you do

Man073_Man074_0537,of relationship it's my responsibility
Man073_Man074_0538,and I take it proudly you know because I
Man073_Man074_0539,had the foresight to see the foresight
Man073_Man074_0540,to go to therapy you know to talk about
Man073_Man074_0541,these issues and to write a letter and
Man073_Man074_0542,then actually confront him you know that
Man073_Man074_0543,took a lot you know and it's interesting
Man073_Man074_0544,we're always talking about what it is to
Man073_Man074_0545,be a man
Man073_Man074_0546,I don't I don't you know I love to bake
Man073_Man074_0547,you know I love baking cookies I
Man073_Man074_0548,absolutely love baking you know and some
Man073_Man074_0549,people but like oh man and I just it
Man073_Man074_0550,drives me crazy
Man073_Man074_0551,when people say you have to do X in
Man073_Man074_0552,order to be a man and that's just not
Man073_Man074_0553,the case
Man073_Man074_0554,yeah that's just not the case at all
Man073_Man074_0555,yeah same reason why a woman doesn't
Man073_Man074_0556,have to be in the kitchen in order to be
Man073_Man074_0557,like that's stupid
Man073_Man074_0558,yeah that's fucking stupid and yeah the
Man073_Man074_0559,first time I felt like a man it's when I
Man073_Man074_0560,confronted my father know about why he
Man073_Man074_0561,would hit me yeah mine is like a little
Man073_Man074_0562,bit of yours I think the first time it's
Man073_Man074_0563,like I always grew up and I was kind of
Man073_Man074_0564,uh like kind of sensitive compared to
Man073_Man074_0565,everyone else so I think and I feel like
Man073_Man074_0566,for a long time like I carry this thing
Man073_Man074_0567,like like that that like pressure like I
Man073_Man074_0568,gotta be like X you know what I mean
Man073_Man074_0569,like I have to be like tough or like I
Man073_Man074_0570,always have to like like it's like like
Man073_Man074_0571,you gotta do like the man things like
Man073_Man074_0572,you got to do things like like be quick
Man073_Man074_0573,to anger or like be like you know what I
Man073_Man074_0574,mean like always like demand respect and
Man073_Man074_0575,I was never that and I could never like
Man073_Man074_0576,do that not at least not in that way
Man073_Man074_0577,so I think for me it was like learning
Man073_Man074_0578,that like you don't have to like being a
Man073_Man074_0579,man or just being a person in general it
Man073_Man074_0580,was just kind of like you just you have
Man073_Man074_0581,to like carve your own version of who
Man073_Man074_0582,you are you know I mean it's not and do
Man073_Man074_0583,you think as african-americans like you
Man073_Man074_0584,know there's this other layer on top of
Man073_Man074_0585,it yeah you know yeah
Man073_Man074_0586,like because I'm pretty sure you've
Man073_Man074_0587,heard you know you talk white yeah yeah
Man073_Man074_0588,and it's like it hurts when you hear it
Man073_Man074_0589,from other brothers you know from other
Man073_Man074_0590,sisters yeah because it's it's like do
Man073_Man074_0591,you know what you're saying yeah
Man073_Man074_0592,you know when you put whiteness up here
Man073_Man074_0593,like as the standard yeah you know what
Man073_Man074_0594,I mean yeah that completely drives me
Man073_Man074_0595,insane
Man073_Man074_0596,ya know it's mean it's it's a weird
Man073_Man074_0597,thing because we know it's just it's
Man073_Man074_0598,like it's like a very like trance is
Man073_Man074_0599,really transparent right because you
Man073_Man074_0600,know like exactly where something comes
Man073_Man074_0601,from like you know exactly where like
Man073_Man074_0602,this like those behaviors are like how
Man073_Man074_0603,like a lot of dudes like you'll see and
Man073_Man074_0604,like the hood or like very like hyper
Man073_Man074_0605,mat like a lot of dudes I grew up with
Man073_Man074_0606,were like very like hyper masculine like
Man073_Man074_0607,those yeah like oh my god the people
Man073_Man074_0608,like I grew I grew up with and it
Man073_Man074_0609,obviously comes from like like the
Man073_Man074_0610,especially men like men had to be like
Man073_Man074_0611,tough because at any moment someone
Man073_Man074_0612,could like a group of white people would
Man073_Man074_0613,come in your neighborhood you have to be
Man073_Man074_0614,like ready to protect mm-hmm everybody
Man073_Man074_0615,so then all those that thing or that
Man073_Man074_0616,like that thing like that demanding
Man073_Man074_0617,respect that all that stuff gets like
Man073_Man074_0618,passed down through generations yeah and
Man073_Man074_0619,then but then now it's just us in the
Man073_Man074_0620,neighborhood doing it to each other you
Man073_Man074_0621,know so it's like we still they're still
Man073_Man074_0622,like that whatever part of like genetics
Man073_Man074_0623,that is that like that switch is still
Man073_Man074_0624,on because for so many centuries we've
Man073_Man074_0625,had to be like that right but now
Man073_Man074_0626,there's it's just us in the neighborhood
Man073_Man074_0627,together right you know what I like
Man073_Man074_0628,about I don't know if you saw this
Man073_Man074_0629,actually yesterday if you're coming up
Man073_Man074_0630,the hill but there's now there's like
Man073_Man074_0631,this black officer that's in the
Man073_Man074_0632,neighborhood and he's a very friendly

Man073_Man074_0665,actually a really great question you can
Man073_Man074_0666,all the ones though what is something
Man073_Man074_0667,you learned from your upbringing you've
Man073_Man074_0668,had to unlearn I think it's a lot of
Man073_Man074_0669,what we were just talking about man just
Man073_Man074_0670,like very just being very like just just
Man073_Man074_0671,like all like the the stat like the
Man073_Man074_0672,impossible standards of masculinity that
Man073_Man074_0673,like you that you have over you you know
Man073_Man074_0674,what I mean
Man073_Man074_0675,it's like you have to have been with
Man073_Man074_0676,this many women you have to be great at
Man073_Man074_0677,fighting yeah it's like I'm possibly
Man073_Man074_0678,have to make a lot of money family it's
Man073_Man074_0679,like some of those things don't even
Man073_Man074_0680,like being great at fighting and having
Man073_Man074_0681,a great job are mutually exclusive
Man073_Man074_0682,unless you're a boxer that works so so
Man073_Man074_0683,yeah just like having to unlearn like
Man073_Man074_0684,there's like a lot of really impossible
Man073_Man074_0685,standards that a lot of people try to
Man073_Man074_0686,live up to and you can't be free like
Man073_Man074_0687,trying to follow sure those so just
Man073_Man074_0688,slowly I'm still like working on it
Man073_Man074_0689,every now and then like oh I don't know
Man073_Man074_0690,do you just get like because I'd never
Man073_Man074_0691,fully felt like I was there like like
Man073_Man074_0692,like friends that I had like like at
Man073_Man074_0693,that standard or as hyper-masculine as
Man073_Man074_0694,other people like I still I felt I feel
Man073_Man074_0695,like I feel like I've always felt kind
Man073_Man074_0696,of inadequate because of it
Man073_Man074_0697,so slowly starting to unwind and
Man073_Man074_0698,untangle those things and being present
Man073_Man074_0699,with them and then trying to like let
Man073_Man074_0700,them go yeah okay
Man073_Man074_0701,yeah it's silly you can't be free that
Man073_Man074_0702,way hmm the end how do you think my
Man073_Man074_0703,childhood plus upbringing affected me as
Man073_Man074_0704,a person well I definitely think well

Man073_Man074_0755,the stuff that you're writing out like
Man073_Man074_0756,I'm very like messy and like just like
Man073_Man074_0757,try to get stuff done like you're way
Man073_Man074_0758,more a lot more detail-oriented than I
Man073_Man074_0759,am so also trying to learn how to do
Man073_Man074_0760,that and plan and be disciplined about
Man073_Man074_0761,like the work that I'm trying to do you
Man073_Man074_0762,use a beast
Man073_Man074_0763,it's so hard I just want to wave
Man073_Man074_0764,compliments out of the way I got it you
Man073_Man074_0765,agree person what am i learning from you
Man073_Man074_0766,apparently now pulling cards at the
Man073_Man074_0767,right time
Man073_Man074_0768,what are you getting out of this
Man073_Man074_0769,friendship and what would you do to
Man073_Man074_0770,improve it man I could definitely feel
Man073_Man074_0771,like a you know I've gained a brother
Man073_Man074_0772,and essentially I feel like it's like
Man073_Man074_0773,the opposite of what games are I know
Man073_Man074_0774,games are supposed to bring people
Man073_Man074_0775,together but especially video games we
Man073_Man074_0776,grew closer because of you know how
Man073_Man074_0777,competitive we are when that's usually
Man073_Man074_0778,the opposite mariokart mariokart somehow
Man073_Man074_0779,Luigi's death Stan we become better
Man073_Man074_0780,friend you know and with all
Man073_Man074_0781,relationships I think something that can
Man073_Man074_0782,be better especially on my part is
Man073_Man074_0783,communication like you said about the
Man073_Man074_0784,text message I am not the best with
Man073_Man074_0785,communication and that's something that
Man073_Man074_0786,I really need to do better especially as
Man073_Man074_0787,I get as I get older just because you
Man073_Man074_0788,know me I'm very plain and simple I mean
Man073_Man074_0789,I didn't have an iPhone to a lastly yeah
Man073_Man074_0790,I have like the same shoes like I'm very
Man073_Man074_0791,like I'm just a plain person but yeah
Man073_Man074_0792,communication I think could be better
Man073_Man074_0793,and also we plan things and then we
Man073_Man074_0794,don't do them so time yeah you know yeah
Man073_Man074_0795,you got a kid oh yeah I get better at
Man073_Man074_0796,that yeah we do yeah because our life is
Man073_Man074_0797,going by and I don't want to get further
Man073_Man074_0798,apart because I didn't pick up a phone
Man073_Man074_0799,you know and then a month goes by and
Man073_Man074_0800,you're like yeah but yeah that's I would
Man073_Man074_0801,definitely have to improve communication
Man073_Man074_0802,okay yeah that's my part yeah
Man073_Man074_0803,what do you think is the most important
Man073_Man074_0804,lesson I'm learning at this stage in my
Man073_Man074_0805,life both okay what I think is the most
Man073_Man074_0806,important lesson that you're learning
Man073_Man074_0807,your life yes I think you're laughing I
Man073_Man074_0808,think that you are learning and it seems

Man073_Man074_0810,[Music]
Man073_Man074_0811,yeah I can I can easy for so long yeah
Man073_Man074_0812,and I can I can see it just like and I'm
Man073_Man074_0813,starting to see it just like in the way
Man073_Man074_0814,you interact with people and just like
Man073_Man074_0815,the the confidence that you were
Man073_Man074_0816,building around people you don't know
Man073_Man074_0817,and also just putting yourself out there
Man073_Man074_0818,more where there comes to like putting
Man073_Man074_0819,yourself out there for like writing
Man073_Man074_0820,fellowships or yeah or just like making
Man073_Man074_0821,sure or like kind of like constantly
Man073_Man074_0822,just having like a rotation of things
Man073_Man074_0823,that you're working on in developing and
Man073_Man074_0824,yeah and also building like a really
Man073_Man074_0825,strong like solid personal life and hmm
Man073_Man074_0826,yeah it seems like that is uh that's
Man073_Man074_0827,what I've been noticing yes now do me I
Man073_Man074_0828,think the most important thing that
Man073_Man074_0829,you're you're learning right now is yeah
Man073_Man074_0830,I think you're learning how to become a
Man073_Man074_0831,better writer instead of storyteller you
Man073_Man074_0832,know so just just awesome yeah it's
Man073_Man074_0833,going to therapy and meditation that's
Man073_Man074_0834,another thing you're trying to you've
Man073_Man074_0835,been trying to get me the longest time
Man073_Man074_0836,to do this meditation I'm too neurotic
Man073_Man074_0837,everybody is man
Man073_Man074_0838,and I know but I'm just amazed that how
Man073_Man074_0839,that you find stillness as a weapon
Man073_Man074_0840,and I find stillness to be just like all
Man073_Man074_0841,right
Man073_Man074_0842,dying here you know and I find that you
Man073_Man074_0843,have found that like I said your
Man073_Man074_0844,strength comes from your stillness and
Man073_Man074_0845,how quiet you are and how reserved your
Man073_Man074_0846,reserved I reserved you become because
Man073_Man074_0847,you're not the same Geron who punched a
Man073_Man074_0848,hole in the wall yeah you're not the
Man073_Man074_0849,same Girondin punched a hole in the wall
Man073_Man074_0850,because a video game I can never be that
Man073_Man074_0851,one again never be that guy again I
Man073_Man074_0852,actually used to like blow up like a lot
Man073_Man074_0853,because I used to like bottle stuff all
Man073_Man074_0854,right yeah yeah yeah and it's definitely
Man073_Man074_0855,seeped in through your personal life as
Man073_Man074_0856,well you know with companies and
Man073_Man074_0857,everything and you know and I admitted
Man073_Man074_0858,like I was talking harder the day that

Man073_Man074_0866,sister's married has been married is a
Man073_Man074_0867,couple years you know and all that
Man073_Man074_0868,pressure you know was getting to me and
Man073_Man074_0869,you know I was looking at the person who
Man073_Man074_0870,was closest to me which is you and I see
Man073_Man074_0871,all these great things that you have and
Man073_Man074_0872,I was like well I ever achieved even
Man073_Man074_0873,half of the success that you have your
Man073_Man074_0874,personal life you know successful
Man073_Man074_0875,stand-up and yeah it's just yeah and it
Man073_Man074_0876,took a long time for me to try to figure
Man073_Man074_0877,out why I feel that way because I knew
Man073_Man074_0878,like that it wasn't like me to be
Man073_Man074_0879,jealous I've never been the jealous type
Man073_Man074_0880,but I had to figure out why and you know

Man073_Man074_0901,deal with that jealousy part of me
Man073_Man074_0902,because it's I feel like in some way
Man073_Man074_0903,it's why we have a disconnect at times
Man073_Man074_0904,and that's something that I know I had
