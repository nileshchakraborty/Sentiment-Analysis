Man031_Woman036_0001,so first question describe your first
Man031_Woman036_0002,impression of me when I really saw you
Man031_Woman036_0003,for the first time I thought this guy's
Man031_Woman036_0004,really handsome and I told her she looks
Man031_Woman036_0005,first and I said that I would like to
Man031_Woman036_0006,talk to you and that I would like him to
Man031_Woman036_0007,introduce me to you and then he did and
Man031_Woman036_0008,I told you that I heard a lot about you
Man031_Woman036_0009,which wasn't necessarily true because I
Man031_Woman036_0010,hadn't heard that much about you but
Man031_Woman036_0011,every want to start a conversation and
Man031_Woman036_0012,you know yeah you know where that went
Man031_Woman036_0013,so that was like at so did you also
Man031_Woman036_0014,blend this in advance
Man031_Woman036_0015,I know I've learned a lot of things in
Man031_Woman036_0016,advance I didn't plan this
Man031_Woman036_0017,[Laughter]
Man031_Woman036_0018,when do you feel closest to me
Man031_Woman036_0019,I think I'll feel feel closest to you
Man031_Woman036_0020,when we have nice long talks but about
Man031_Woman036_0021,us basically mainly and when we really
Man031_Woman036_0022,feel like we learn something from each
Man031_Woman036_0023,other every time we we have that's that
Man031_Woman036_0024,makes me feel most closest to you
Man031_Woman036_0025,describe how you feel of how you think I
Man031_Woman036_0026,feel when you're with the other partner
Man031_Woman036_0027,I think you feel quite happy because
Man031_Woman036_0028,it's usually when we split up our time
Man031_Woman036_0029,is because you're busy doing something
Man031_Woman036_0030,else and we have a night together and I
Man031_Woman036_0031,think you're happy that we're happy
Man031_Woman036_0032,because you don't just love me as your
Man031_Woman036_0033,partner but you love Phoenix as your
Man031_Woman036_0034,friend as well so I think it actually
Man031_Woman036_0035,makes you happier knowing that we are
Man031_Woman036_0036,together somewhere else then if I would
Man031_Woman036_0037,be alone at home
Man031_Woman036_0038,when do you get jealous of me being with
Man031_Woman036_0039,others I I get jealous when when it's
Man031_Woman036_0040,something that that wasn't agreed upon
Man031_Woman036_0041,in first place like for instance with if
Man031_Woman036_0042,I know something or if like if you come
Man031_Woman036_0043,to do something with my three legs and
Man031_Woman036_0044,that will never make me jealous in any
Man031_Woman036_0045,way with if you certain at a certain
Man031_Woman036_0046,point start doing these things with
Man031_Woman036_0047,other people that yeah we haven't talked
Man031_Woman036_0048,about or haven't haven't agreed upon
Man031_Woman036_0049,then then that will probably make me
Man031_Woman036_0050,feel quite jealous does that happen now
Man031_Woman036_0051,at any time No
Man031_Woman036_0052,do we have enough sex I don't think I'm
Man031_Woman036_0053,ever happy with any amount of sex but
Man031_Woman036_0054,that's mostly because we can't be
Man031_Woman036_0055,together every day all the time but for
Man031_Woman036_0056,the time we spend together I think we
Man031_Woman036_0057,have more than enough sex
Man031_Woman036_0058,what would make you leave me I think I
Man031_Woman036_0059,would leave you if you would really
Man031_Woman036_0060,completely break my back my trust or
Man031_Woman036_0061,agreements we've made in this in this
Man031_Woman036_0062,relationship
Man031_Woman036_0063,I think especially since there's so much
Man031_Woman036_0064,emphasis on these agreements to make
Man031_Woman036_0065,everything work as it's working well now
Man031_Woman036_0066,then it would be yeah for me really hard
Man031_Woman036_0067,to to get by to get past a point we have
Man031_Woman036_0068,yeah Trust is such a huge broken know
Man031_Woman036_0069,everything else with it
Man031_Woman036_0070,yeah exactly but I think that what holds
Man031_Woman036_0071,for any any serious relationship yeah if
Man031_Woman036_0072,you think that I think it's necessarily
Man031_Woman036_0073,because of what we have or little bit
Man031_Woman036_0074,triad we have yeah yeah
Man031_Woman036_0075,I wouldn't break you transparently I
Man031_Woman036_0076,wouldn't break your trust by the way I
Man031_Woman036_0077,don't know if there was one thing as I
Man031_Woman036_0078,still don't understand about you what is
Man031_Woman036_0079,it
Man031_Woman036_0080,apparently I think you understand a lot
Man031_Woman036_0081,but I'm I'm gonna come up with something
Man031_Woman036_0082,I don't think so maybe there's not
Man031_Woman036_0083,something you don't understand but it's
Man031_Woman036_0084,something I'm scared that you don't
Man031_Woman036_0085,believe that this is true and that's
Man031_Woman036_0086,that although I get anxious at times and
Man031_Woman036_0087,I get I may seem really weak and I'm
Man031_Woman036_0088,still a really strong person and I know
Man031_Woman036_0089,for example it Felix
Man031_Woman036_0090,often says that to me like I know you
Man031_Woman036_0091,were really starting a strong person
Man031_Woman036_0092,you're such a strong woman and a really
Man031_Woman036_0093,happy that you are and I don't think you
Man031_Woman036_0094,necessarily see that enough and I tried
Man031_Woman036_0095,to show you that but it's really hard to
Man031_Woman036_0096,and maybe that's not something you don't
Man031_Woman036_0097,understand because I think on some on a
Man031_Woman036_0098,meta level you actually understand that
Man031_Woman036_0099,I am strong with you maybe you don't
Man031_Woman036_0100,really feel or see it enough what makes
Man031_Woman036_0101,you think that I don't you're mostly
Man031_Woman036_0102,that you've never communicated it to me
Man031_Woman036_0103,yeah I need a lot of recognition and a
Man031_Woman036_0104,lot of words any words yeah and when
Man031_Woman036_0105,that's not there I'm scared that you
Man031_Woman036_0106,might not understand that that's
Man031_Woman036_0107,actually how I think or how I see myself
Man031_Woman036_0108,and maybe it's not true but then you
Man031_Woman036_0109,should also
Man031_Woman036_0110,tell me no I do think I see I see you as
Man031_Woman036_0111,a very strong person and yeah it's
Man031_Woman036_0112,something like you just described
Man031_Woman036_0113,happens I don't think that that any any
Man031_Woman036_0114,less of you because that's less strong
Man031_Woman036_0115,because if you you could think she said
Man031_Woman036_0116,that's something it's not really
Man031_Woman036_0117,something you don't control by being a
Man031_Woman036_0118,strong person it's just it's something I
Man031_Woman036_0119,try to control baby yeah all the time
Man031_Woman036_0120,yeah like you'd like a depression for
Man031_Woman036_0121,instance you control it it's not
Man031_Woman036_0122,something that's part of my personality
Man031_Woman036_0123,mm-hmm and sometimes I'm afraid that you
Man031_Woman036_0124,don't really see that that you see it
Man031_Woman036_0125,has two connected parts of me yeah the
Man031_Woman036_0126,depressed part and the rest of my
Man031_Woman036_0127,personality but I think that the rest of
Man031_Woman036_0128,it is 99% and that the depression is
Man031_Woman036_0129,maybe some part of me but something and
Man031_Woman036_0130,something that's probably always gonna
Man031_Woman036_0131,be there what's something that you know
Man031_Woman036_0132,could be taken care of and a big part of
Man031_Woman036_0133,taking care of that is being loved for
Man031_Woman036_0134,who you are and not for some something
Man031_Woman036_0135,extra that's there because it's for me
Man031_Woman036_0136,to me it's still just an illness yeah
Man031_Woman036_0137,well we digress
Man031_Woman036_0138,my turn
Man031_Woman036_0139,yes tell me about the time I
Man031_Woman036_0140,disappointed you and how do you feel
Man031_Woman036_0141,about it now
Man031_Woman036_0142,I think I'm I think the time that I was
Man031_Woman036_0143,at this point it was when I when I asked
Man031_Woman036_0144,you to help me with the small drilling
Man031_Woman036_0145,thing and thought it was less important
Man031_Woman036_0146,well I meant something for me to ever
Man031_Woman036_0147,done I also understand that you in that
Man031_Woman036_0148,case yeah just something completely
Man031_Woman036_0149,different on your mind that we were
Man031_Woman036_0150,going out and I wanted to squeeze it in
Man031_Woman036_0151,between I understand that would have
Man031_Woman036_0152,disturbed your sense of fear about going
Man031_Woman036_0153,to have a nice night and it's nice yeah
Man031_Woman036_0154,I feel bad about it
Man031_Woman036_0155,what change would you make to improve
Man031_Woman036_0156,our sex life I won't want you to I know
Man031_Woman036_0157,it's difficult for you because we talk
Man031_Woman036_0158,about it all the same it were really
Man031_Woman036_0159,we've had huge progress over the past
Man031_Woman036_0160,months but I would it would mean so much
Man031_Woman036_0161,to me and I know it would mean the same
Man031_Woman036_0162,to you if you could completely let
Man031_Woman036_0163,yourself go like I do
Man031_Woman036_0164,mm-hm and I I'm not afraid to let myself
Man031_Woman036_0165,go right oh and I don't think you are
Man031_Woman036_0166,either
Man031_Woman036_0167,but I I really hope you're gonna make an
Man031_Woman036_0168,experience that in the next couple of
Man031_Woman036_0169,weeks or months and that we're gonna get
Man031_Woman036_0170,there at some point so yeah I would I
Man031_Woman036_0171,would change that you could completely
Man031_Woman036_0172,let yourself go that's a great part of
Man031_Woman036_0173,of sex for you as well yeah I think
Man031_Woman036_0174,that's something we could really enjoy
Man031_Woman036_0175,together I think we're almost there
Man031_Woman036_0176,what's your question you always wanted
Man031_Woman036_0177,to ask me
Man031_Woman036_0178,what is for you Dardis part of our
Man031_Woman036_0179,relationship and with the three of us
Man031_Woman036_0180,with Felix also my time yeah there's
Man031_Woman036_0181,there's nothing physical or emotional or
Man031_Woman036_0182,that that doesn't feel right to me but
Man031_Woman036_0183,sometimes I feel horrible for having to
Man031_Woman036_0184,schedule so much and not do anything
Man031_Woman036_0185,spontaneous because we have to split up
Man031_Woman036_0186,our time and we also have our jobs and
Man031_Woman036_0187,our studies and other social activities
Man031_Woman036_0188,because all three of us are really
Man031_Woman036_0189,social and have a lot of friends and we
Man031_Woman036_0190,want to see those people too and then
Man031_Woman036_0191,the four years for you and for Felix you
Man031_Woman036_0192,just have your girlfriend the both of
Man031_Woman036_0193,you and I need to squeeze in all that
Man031_Woman036_0194,time and ask me time for myself as well
Man031_Woman036_0195,and that's that's the hardest part by
Man031_Woman036_0196,far I can't even come up with anything
Man031_Woman036_0197,else that I'm not happy with about this
Man031_Woman036_0198,and I'm in a really happy place with the
Man031_Woman036_0199,three of us but sometimes I would want
Man031_Woman036_0200,an extra day a week to spend with you or
Man031_Woman036_0201,with a lake so it switches every week
Man031_Woman036_0202,it's more time so you think we could
Man031_Woman036_0203,learn and if we could spend more time
Man031_Woman036_0204,together I think we would learn a lot
Man031_Woman036_0205,more and we'd be just that little bit
Man031_Woman036_0206,less do you feel that's a trade-off
Man031_Woman036_0207,you're making by having two
Man031_Woman036_0208,relationships sometimes it does feel
Man031_Woman036_0209,like spending time with you means less
Man031_Woman036_0210,time in Felix and spending time with
Man031_Woman036_0211,Phyllis means less time with you and
Man031_Woman036_0212,then there's the nights that you say oh
Man031_Woman036_0213,I want some time for myself and then I'm
Man031_Woman036_0214,like oh good I can go to see feelings in
Man031_Woman036_0215,minutes
Man031_Woman036_0216,so this is rather practical concentrate
Man031_Woman036_0217,it's absolutely named harness emotional
Man031_Woman036_0218,fire if I have to
Man031_Woman036_0219,[Music]
Man031_Woman036_0220,I don't think it's I don't think it's
Man031_Woman036_0221,anything internal to our relationship I
Man031_Woman036_0222,think is mostly people I would sign our
Man031_Woman036_0223,relationship who don't understand or you
Man031_Woman036_0224,see everything wrong no which is not a
Man031_Woman036_0225,problem at all at all because it's not
Man031_Woman036_0226,no it's not normative sometimes I just
Man031_Woman036_0227,like people not to look at us like it's
Man031_Woman036_0228,weird even when they're even when their
Man031_Woman036_0229,reaction is really positive sometimes
Man031_Woman036_0230,that can be assaulting - or yeah I don't
Man031_Woman036_0231,want everyone to high-five me and I
Man031_Woman036_0232,don't want to everyone to come up to me
Man031_Woman036_0233,and ask me questions and I know and I'm
Man031_Woman036_0234,I don't mind being the poster child for
Man031_Woman036_0235,polyamorous relationships but so some
Man031_Woman036_0236,days you just want people to accept it
Man031_Woman036_0237,and not worry about it so much or think
Man031_Woman036_0238,that it's a it's a free card to get in
Man031_Woman036_0239,on our personal messes like people
Man031_Woman036_0240,asking well how's that gonna be when
Man031_Woman036_0241,you're older and you're gonna have
Man031_Woman036_0242,children you don't ask that to two
Man031_Woman036_0243,people who are in the relationship just
Man031_Woman036_0244,so why tell us cuz wait the three of us
Man031_Woman036_0245,yeah
Man031_Woman036_0246,that's something that is it yeah nothing
Man031_Woman036_0247,for another the like like last example
Man031_Woman036_0248,what my children if you yeah because
Man031_Woman036_0249,it's it's different people are yeah
Man031_Woman036_0250,easier I don't know why but they're
Man031_Woman036_0251,easier to do these kinds of questions
Man031_Woman036_0252,because of course it's more interesting
Man031_Woman036_0253,[Laughter]
Man031_Woman036_0254,and it wants to answer everyone's
Man031_Woman036_0255,questions just not every day at every
Man031_Woman036_0256,party at every social gathering yeah
Man031_Woman036_0257,yeah I'm also I think I've some of the
Man031_Woman036_0258,same feelings about it like that
Man031_Woman036_0259,sometimes are afraid that people do our
Man031_Woman036_0260,produces okay
Man031_Woman036_0261,I have a produces about it and I think
Man031_Woman036_0262,it's maybe relationship can't be equal
Man031_Woman036_0263,but that's not true sometimes I think I
Man031_Woman036_0264,think we have between us between Felix
Man031_Woman036_0265,and with the three of us we have one of
Man031_Woman036_0266,the most equal relationships I know yeah
Man031_Woman036_0267,like nothing is a problem and everything
Man031_Woman036_0268,is so communicative and I don't see why
Man031_Woman036_0269,people think being with the three of you
Man031_Woman036_0270,would make it less cool it actually
Man031_Woman036_0271,makes it more equal what's the greatest
Man031_Woman036_0272,lesson I taught you I think the greatest
Man031_Woman036_0273,for me or at least what what meant most
Man031_Woman036_0274,for me is that you really convinced me
Man031_Woman036_0275,it's okay to be open really share every
Man031_Woman036_0276,feeling that that I have with you or
Man031_Woman036_0277,with people in general that's especially
Man031_Woman036_0278,with you of course like yeah that
Man031_Woman036_0279,talking enough cow we had about that
Man031_Woman036_0280,that's really yeah really changed a lot
Man031_Woman036_0281,for me I think that was I think it made
Man031_Woman036_0282,me almost a different person not a
Man031_Woman036_0283,completely different person but yeah I
Man031_Woman036_0284,found a way to be more you yeah yeah do
Man031_Woman036_0285,I think that's that insights will you
Man031_Woman036_0286,help me grow the person towards yourself
Man031_Woman036_0287,I'm happy you can be you too you can
Man031_Woman036_0288,help me be a better
Man031_Woman036_0289,what's quality to Felix and I have that
Man031_Woman036_0290,enables us to share you first off I
Man031_Woman036_0291,don't think you share me because you
Man031_Woman036_0292,don't think were you do figure I don't
Man031_Woman036_0293,think you share no no definitely not
Man031_Woman036_0294,I think we've got two fully grown
Man031_Woman036_0295,relationships which both are still
Man031_Woman036_0296,growing but and I think they're both a
Man031_Woman036_0297,hundred percent which means I have to
Man031_Woman036_0298,have two hundred percent and I think I
Man031_Woman036_0299,can do that and I think that I think
Man031_Woman036_0300,everyone could do it with enough talking
Man031_Woman036_0301,so if there would be one quality that
Man031_Woman036_0302,you both have to have to do this it
Man031_Woman036_0303,would be communication skills and
Man031_Woman036_0304,talking everything over I think
Man031_Woman036_0305,sometimes we tell each other that we
Man031_Woman036_0306,don't talk about something enough or I
Man031_Woman036_0307,tell you to explain something to me
Man031_Woman036_0308,but I don't think we realize that we
Man031_Woman036_0309,talked a lot and we tell each other a
Man031_Woman036_0310,lot and we share a lot of our feelings
Man031_Woman036_0311,about the other partner or about our own
Man031_Woman036_0312,relationships and that the days that we
Man031_Woman036_0313,don't talk much or when we're not really
Man031_Woman036_0314,in the mood for sharing we still share
Man031_Woman036_0315,more than 99% of people I think and I
Man031_Woman036_0316,think that's something special that we
Man031_Woman036_0317,all three of us have which makes this
Man031_Woman036_0318,work agree do you really think will last
Man031_Woman036_0319,I think will last yeah yeah I think it's
Man031_Woman036_0320,all really really solidly built the
Man031_Woman036_0321,relationship um on the right feelings
Man031_Woman036_0322,its intentions exactly and I think
Man031_Woman036_0323,that's most important parts to make it
Man031_Woman036_0324,make it
Man031_Woman036_0325,5:02 to last for long periods of time I
Man031_Woman036_0326,think we also shared the thoughts that
Man031_Woman036_0327,if you don't feel like it's gonna last
Man031_Woman036_0328,mm-hmm yeah if you should have yeah
Man031_Woman036_0329,that's of course not the same minute
Man031_Woman036_0330,sometimes when you're a rough patch you
Man031_Woman036_0331,might have nope there too but that's
Man031_Woman036_0332,yeah if you have that feeling constantly
Man031_Woman036_0333,then from the beginning it's going to be
Man031_Woman036_0334,hard to make it work
Man031_Woman036_0335,what makes me different from your other
Man031_Woman036_0336,partner everything you're a completely
Man031_Woman036_0337,different person
Man031_Woman036_0338,the only thing I could come up with it
Man031_Woman036_0339,you have in common is being very gentle
Man031_Woman036_0340,and being very very down-to-earth but
Man031_Woman036_0341,for everything else you have completely
Man031_Woman036_0342,different views on things you've got
Man031_Woman036_0343,your own personality sure there hasn't
Man031_Woman036_0344,been a moment ever up until now I've
Man031_Woman036_0345,thought of you as the same personal or
Man031_Woman036_0346,comparable in any sense you also
Man031_Woman036_0347,wouldn't be very interesting I would
Man031_Woman036_0348,date twins enjoy why are you with me hmm
Man031_Woman036_0349,I'm with you because you're a very
Man031_Woman036_0350,lovable person and yeah after all yeah
Man031_Woman036_0351,they'll also just I feel fine to work
Man031_Woman036_0352,[Laughter]
Man031_Woman036_0353,and I think we make a very good good
Man031_Woman036_0354,couple everyone can really compliment
Man031_Woman036_0355,each other in a lot of things and yeah
Man031_Woman036_0356,we will both see a lot of things from
Man031_Woman036_0357,differents different perspective I think
Man031_Woman036_0358,you tend to see a lot of things more
Man031_Woman036_0359,emotionally where I tend to see a lot
Man031_Woman036_0360,more practically and we complement each
Man031_Woman036_0361,other and learn from each other yeah
Man031_Woman036_0362,above all because I love you
Man031_Woman036_0363,go to that what do you think it's the
Man031_Woman036_0364,hardest thing for me right now I think
Man031_Woman036_0365,you struggle every day to open up share
Man031_Woman036_0366,your feelings mm-hmm tell me or everyone
Man031_Woman036_0367,around you what you're what's going on
Man031_Woman036_0368,inside your head yeah and I think that's
Man031_Woman036_0369,gonna be a struggle for a while longer
Man031_Woman036_0370,and yeah I think that's by far the
Man031_Woman036_0371,hardest part I don't think there's
Man031_Woman036_0372,anything else that you have to focus on
Man031_Woman036_0373,either that's something that that's
Man031_Woman036_0374,that's something that's really gonna
Man031_Woman036_0375,help you in the long run
Man031_Woman036_0376,yeah in all the parts of your life
Man031_Woman036_0377,mm-hmm that's the hardest thing for you
Man031_Woman036_0378,right now
Man031_Woman036_0379,yeah yeah I agree yeah I also really
Man031_Woman036_0380,think that's that that's your path to
Man031_Woman036_0381,fulfillment in a way that if that that's
Man031_Woman036_0382,if you'll make that if that works
Man031_Woman036_0383,mm-hmm you can be a really happy easy
Man031_Woman036_0384,person yeah somewhere I think everyone
Man031_Woman036_0385,already knows like yesterday when
Man031_Woman036_0386,someone says just we know you care you
Man031_Woman036_0387,have to act like you don't care so now
Man031_Woman036_0388,the only person who has to accept this
Man031_Woman036_0389,you look at another one
Man031_Woman036_0390,whether you like most about our
Man031_Woman036_0391,relationship the thing I like most about
Man031_Woman036_0392,our relationship is that when I'm with
Man031_Woman036_0393,you I'm not necessarily the best me that
Man031_Woman036_0394,I can be I'm not the me that I would be
Man031_Woman036_0395,or that I would show my parents or the
Man031_Woman036_0396,me that I am when I work really hard to
Man031_Woman036_0397,achieve something or that I am when I
Man031_Woman036_0398,working I'm working on a project or I'm
Man031_Woman036_0399,studying or to me I am with my friends
Man031_Woman036_0400,but I'm the me that I like this and that
Man031_Woman036_0401,when I look at myself I think yeah
Man031_Woman036_0402,that's that's the ISA I really want to
Man031_Woman036_0403,be and maybe that's not the nicest
Man031_Woman036_0404,person and maybe that's not the most the
Man031_Woman036_0405,most remorseful person in any way but
Man031_Woman036_0406,it's it's how I like myself and you give
Man031_Woman036_0407,me the space and the room and the
Man031_Woman036_0408,freedom to be that me this something
Man031_Woman036_0409,that I don't think anyone else thinking
Man031_Woman036_0410,that means a lot to me if I can make you
Man031_Woman036_0411,feel that's way there's not that much
Man031_Woman036_0412,room for me anywhere oh nothing home not
Man031_Woman036_0413,with friends sometimes we talk about
Man031_Woman036_0414,that it's not enough room in this
Man031_Woman036_0415,country to be how I want to be like not
Man031_Woman036_0416,very big country it's not a country
Man031_Woman036_0417,there's too many people
Man031_Woman036_0418,that I when I'm because you know I'm a
Man031_Woman036_0419,really passionate person and that's not
Man031_Woman036_0420,generally accepted in the Netherlands so
Man031_Woman036_0421,that ya know when you give me that space
Man031_Woman036_0422,and that means it's the world to me
