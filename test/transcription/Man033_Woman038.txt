Man033_Woman038_0001,each other prolly take each other in and
Man033_Woman038_0002,then Jeff when you feel ready you know
Man033_Woman038_0003,give it like good 30 seconds looking at
Man033_Woman038_0004,when you feel ready take your first
Man033_Woman038_0005,party and we also need cards yeah so
Man033_Woman038_0006,Jeff okay
Man033_Woman038_0007,what do you remember about the first
Man033_Woman038_0008,time we met well you know I always like
Man033_Woman038_0009,to revisit that moment when you walk in
Man033_Woman038_0010,and I was in a room helping to organize
Man033_Woman038_0011,a newspaper and I just saw you and I was
Man033_Woman038_0012,like she's so adorable probably somebody
Man033_Woman038_0013,died because he's ugly you look so
Man033_Woman038_0014,adorable and I was just hoping that you
Man033_Woman038_0015,will sit next to me and you did and then
Man033_Woman038_0016,we talked and then your voice was very
Man033_Woman038_0017,beautiful
Man033_Woman038_0018,so I remember very well okay
Man033_Woman038_0019,when do you feel closest to me I feel
Man033_Woman038_0020,closest to you during sexual intercourse
Man033_Woman038_0021,when I'm when I'm helping you with
Man033_Woman038_0022,something that you need assistance with
Man033_Woman038_0023,and a little on the negative side but I
Man033_Woman038_0024,feel closer to you when you're going
Man033_Woman038_0025,through a painful period like with your
Man033_Woman038_0026,father passing away last year no it's uh
Man033_Woman038_0027,it was uh it was a painful experience
Man033_Woman038_0028,and I you know I felt that pain I shared
Man033_Woman038_0029,that pain with you and when we're having
Man033_Woman038_0030,discussions over things that we have in
Man033_Woman038_0031,common
Man033_Woman038_0032,even even when they're disagreements but
Man033_Woman038_0033,more than likely they're agreements
Man033_Woman038_0034,that's when I feel really closest to you
Man033_Woman038_0035,and more abstractly um I feel really
Man033_Woman038_0036,close to you what I'm looking deeply
Man033_Woman038_0037,into your eyes
Man033_Woman038_0038,I don't know if there's only one answer
Man033_Woman038_0039,it's supposed to give no what do you
Man033_Woman038_0040,love about our relationship I think that
Man033_Woman038_0041,this lot of Steel is very fresh that we
Man033_Woman038_0042,plan things and we keep honest to each
Man033_Woman038_0043,other you know like you said before even
Man033_Woman038_0044,if we have differences I like to
Man033_Woman038_0045,highlight the difference just because of
Man033_Woman038_0046,myself I like to know that you know that
Man033_Woman038_0047,I don't agree with stuff but just to be
Man033_Woman038_0048,very clear about you know it's not see
Man033_Woman038_0049,that I like that we can talk about stuff
Man033_Woman038_0050,and through the years probably we have
Man033_Woman038_0051,learned to communicate in different ways
Man033_Woman038_0052,you know I mean it's only like like I
Man033_Woman038_0053,remember when we start communicating is
Man033_Woman038_0054,almost like I assumed that you were
Man033_Woman038_0055,similar to my previous relationships in
Man033_Woman038_0056,many way and it took me a while to
Man033_Woman038_0057,understand that you are more you like to
Man033_Woman038_0058,keep more things to yourself you know
Man033_Woman038_0059,so I stuff like that but still in the
Man033_Woman038_0060,process I guess that it's just nice that
Man033_Woman038_0061,we still keep it fresher on how are you
Man033_Woman038_0062,I all I loved the voyage of discovery
Man033_Woman038_0063,that it is and you keep me on my toes
Man033_Woman038_0064,keep me interested in and trying new
Man033_Woman038_0065,things and like these yeah like this to
Man033_Woman038_0066,me for example yes I love that freshness
Man033_Woman038_0067,aspect
Man033_Woman038_0068,I am the best six you have ever had
Man033_Woman038_0069,that's a question it's a statement noise
Man033_Woman038_0070,of whistle okay I have the basics do you
Man033_Woman038_0071,have everything
Man033_Woman038_0072,yes yeah you are the best sex that I've
Man033_Woman038_0073,ever I think that in terms of if not
Man033_Woman038_0074,quantity quality of the orgasms that I
Man033_Woman038_0075,have with you are the best and I find
Man033_Woman038_0076,that even though that we have had sexual
Man033_Woman038_0077,relations for almost two decades that
Man033_Woman038_0078,the the areas of sexuality there are
Man033_Woman038_0079,areas of sexuality with you that I would
Man033_Woman038_0080,like to that I have not and I would like
Man033_Woman038_0081,to discover with you so I think it's
Man033_Woman038_0082,like the the unders undiscovered country
Man033_Woman038_0083,that I consider where we still have to
Man033_Woman038_0084,go to be part of the thrill
Man033_Woman038_0085,making the sex that we do have very good
Man033_Woman038_0086,yes it it is the best it's okay I don't
Man033_Woman038_0087,think Oh friends if it's not what are
Man033_Woman038_0088,you hesitant to tell me to talk all fine
Man033_Woman038_0089,every time that we need to talk about
Man033_Woman038_0090,then I'm like okay let me just prepare
Man033_Woman038_0091,the fear death does I would say the
Man033_Woman038_0092,toughest you know it still remains a
Man033_Woman038_0093,difficult subject
Man033_Woman038_0094,yeah I think so I think that is you know
Man033_Woman038_0095,with time I have noticed that I just had
Man033_Woman038_0096,to just to let you know to give you
Man033_Woman038_0097,heads up that I'm going to talk about
Man033_Woman038_0098,that and we need to talk about our still
Man033_Woman038_0099,be physical
Man033_Woman038_0100,do you think that it's gotten easier the
Man033_Woman038_0101,hesitancy yeah I mean I think that after
Man033_Woman038_0102,you know finally now that that is Johson
Man033_Woman038_0103,area is difficult for you I mean it just
Man033_Woman038_0104,always have been I have told you that
Man033_Woman038_0105,it's interesting that you know a lot of
Man033_Woman038_0106,our finance when it's economics how to
Man033_Woman038_0107,deal with your finance just to knowing
Man033_Woman038_0108,that I heard gather you know it's I need
Man033_Woman038_0109,to be less difficult but still we we
Man033_Woman038_0110,disagree you know okay I don't have to
Man033_Woman038_0111,continue reading personal finances for
Man033_Woman038_0112,dummies
Man033_Woman038_0113,tell me about the time I disappointed
Man033_Woman038_0114,you
Man033_Woman038_0115,how do you feel about it now one time I
Man033_Woman038_0116,think they're like maybe I think like
Man033_Woman038_0117,there's probably like a time like say
Man033_Woman038_0118,for example when you okay I'll say the
Man033_Woman038_0119,most recent time was when I ran the 15k
Man033_Woman038_0120,in Central Park and I told you when I
Man033_Woman038_0121,should be finished with it
Man033_Woman038_0122,and it was you know the they were
Man033_Woman038_0123,starting to Blizzard and then when I got
Man033_Woman038_0124,to the finish line I was so happy and
Man033_Woman038_0125,also that my time was really good and
Man033_Woman038_0126,then I couldn't find you there and I you
Man033_Woman038_0127,know I felt I forget I felt disappointed
Man033_Woman038_0128,but because I you know I had my phone
Man033_Woman038_0129,with me I called you then I know that
Man033_Woman038_0130,the winter weather is very hard for you
Man033_Woman038_0131,and generally you could not have
Man033_Woman038_0132,predicted hell you know how the path the
Man033_Woman038_0133,unpredictable path train was going to be
Man033_Woman038_0134,so I was I was you know saddened about
Man033_Woman038_0135,that situation but it was all all
Man033_Woman038_0136,forgiven
Man033_Woman038_0137,when I found you that's all you ever
Man033_Woman038_0138,knew was I was disappointed too because
Man033_Woman038_0139,I really wanted to arrive her you know
Man033_Woman038_0140,on time I just you know you take me
Man033_Woman038_0141,awhile to get ready mm-hmm
Man033_Woman038_0142,and it worked and it was so far yeah
Man033_Woman038_0143,as far as how I feel about it now I mean
Man033_Woman038_0144,it's water under the bridge or snow
Man033_Woman038_0145,under the bridge in that case okay
Man033_Woman038_0146,what is the one thing you cannot stand
Man033_Woman038_0147,about me chewing gum when we're walking
Man033_Woman038_0148,into a restaurant then you take it out
Man033_Woman038_0149,and put it somewhere there under the
Man033_Woman038_0150,[Laughter]
Man033_Woman038_0151,okay if there's one thing so if there's
Man033_Woman038_0152,one thing that you would have me change
Man033_Woman038_0153,immediately it would be that I don't
Man033_Woman038_0154,want whether you get from other partners
Man033_Woman038_0155,that you don't get from me
Man033_Woman038_0156,I guess what time
Man033_Woman038_0157,I guess this maybe there's like other
Man033_Woman038_0158,things that I am interested in that I
Man033_Woman038_0159,get from you know my my previous lovers
Man033_Woman038_0160,that I didn't get from you and they were
Man033_Woman038_0161,more like all the lines of st. going to
Man033_Woman038_0162,the type of movies I would like to go to
Man033_Woman038_0163,or the type of you know things that I
Man033_Woman038_0164,would follow on the Internet
Man033_Woman038_0165,but it's I think that really kind of you
Man033_Woman038_0166,know that kind of sums it up right there
Man033_Woman038_0167,you know like I know with your other
Man033_Woman038_0168,partners like you you know like to go
Man033_Woman038_0169,more to art museums and I mean I do like
Man033_Woman038_0170,to go to museums but it's not like you
Man033_Woman038_0171,know but D number-one priority on my
Man033_Woman038_0172,list so I know you get that like with me
Man033_Woman038_0173,I know you you did not grow up with nor
Man033_Woman038_0174,do you like it all the the generic
Man033_Woman038_0175,Hollywood movies so that's sort of like
Man033_Woman038_0176,you know the things that I you know that
Man033_Woman038_0177,I get and what I would like to get from
Man033_Woman038_0178,another partner that I don't get from
Man033_Woman038_0179,you
Man033_Woman038_0180,is someone to run with me in Central
Man033_Woman038_0181,Park you know on on the race days rather
Man033_Woman038_0182,than meet me at the finish line it's
Man033_Woman038_0183,cool I pass on though
Man033_Woman038_0184,how is sex different with your other
Man033_Woman038_0185,partners than it is with me well I we
Man033_Woman038_0186,have you know talked a little bit about
Man033_Woman038_0187,them you know I like so many different
Man033_Woman038_0188,things I think that um I also like like
Man033_Woman038_0189,you know I to play or to pretend that
Man033_Woman038_0190,there are different settings and animals
Man033_Woman038_0191,fears and stuff like that and you are
Man033_Woman038_0192,very realistic so I think that it is no
Man033_Woman038_0193,fun
Man033_Woman038_0194,so that is something that maybe no so
Man033_Woman038_0195,much for you there's some back doors
Man033_Woman038_0196,that I don't I'm not willing to open
Man033_Woman038_0197,that for except okay
Man033_Woman038_0198,whether you get jealous last time and
Man033_Woman038_0199,how did you feel
Man033_Woman038_0200,hmm why did I get jealous yes I got
Man033_Woman038_0201,jealous the last time because I felt
Man033_Woman038_0202,that I had less access to you sexually
Man033_Woman038_0203,then you do with your with your other
Man033_Woman038_0204,partners and how did that how did I felt
Man033_Woman038_0205,I guess I felt rejected and I think I
Man033_Woman038_0206,like try maybe sometimes like over by
Man033_Woman038_0207,intellectualizing by thinking that you
Man033_Woman038_0208,know okay it'll pass you know and sure
Man033_Woman038_0209,enough what time it does but sometimes
Man033_Woman038_0210,it is it's tough to deal with or it's
Man033_Woman038_0211,tough to deal with the fact that I can
Man033_Woman038_0212,act out in different ways like show my
Man033_Woman038_0213,am upset or jealousy you know in other
Man033_Woman038_0214,ways by being very blunt or
Man033_Woman038_0215,argumentative over a dumb thing when in
Man033_Woman038_0216,fact the real reason is is because you
Man033_Woman038_0217,know I have jealousy over your other
Man033_Woman038_0218,partners of sexual access to you or
Man033_Woman038_0219,physical access
Man033_Woman038_0220,than I do why am I your primary partner
Man033_Woman038_0221,because the silly question would mean
Man033_Woman038_0222,because we have a cat together because
Man033_Woman038_0223,well I mean in my search for a partner
Man033_Woman038_0224,in general you know that politics was
Man033_Woman038_0225,the big differences with my previous two
Man033_Woman038_0226,partners and I was very easy with you to
Man033_Woman038_0227,know that we share the same politics for
Man033_Woman038_0228,me I would say art and politics are very
Man033_Woman038_0229,important art it's easier to share with
Man033_Woman038_0230,other people you know it just even you
Man033_Woman038_0231,have to be to have a political agreement
Man033_Woman038_0232,you know but politics is you're so hard
Man033_Woman038_0233,to find someone that you don't have to
Man033_Woman038_0234,discuss the basic stuff you know and
Man033_Woman038_0235,that you have an agreement of they'll
Man033_Woman038_0236,look so that for me it's important and
Man033_Woman038_0237,you have that so for me so with yours
Man033_Woman038_0238,very I don't know is for me just a huge
Man033_Woman038_0239,difference you know with the whole race
Man033_Woman038_0240,of the people and you know I live in
Man033_Woman038_0241,friends you know so that it makes you
Man033_Woman038_0242,special that they still we can almost
Man033_Woman038_0243,read an article and we are already
Man033_Woman038_0244,rather you know getting to the same
Man033_Woman038_0245,conclusion you know you know and I have
Man033_Woman038_0246,the discussion with my other partners
Man033_Woman038_0247,what is just kind of like oh no he's a
Man033_Woman038_0248,reformist oh yeah so yeah that that's
Man033_Woman038_0249,for me I like you I love I like that you
Man033_Woman038_0250,are very you know sweet you're a very
Man033_Woman038_0251,sweet person
Man033_Woman038_0252,I feel that we can you inspire me to
Man033_Woman038_0253,continue building something with you
Man033_Woman038_0254,yeah we have much still in time when we
Man033_Woman038_0255,have changed in our relationship and
Man033_Woman038_0256,still meet you here and I like that
Man033_Woman038_0257,as long as I am in love with you I will
Man033_Woman038_0258,stay with you what would you make you
Man033_Woman038_0259,leave what would make me leave you yes I
Man033_Woman038_0260,guess if there was like a repeated
Man033_Woman038_0261,pattern of you know of you earning me
Man033_Woman038_0262,you know emotionally or even physically
Man033_Woman038_0263,and you know that if you if you wanted
Man033_Woman038_0264,me to go places with you in terms of our
Man033_Woman038_0265,relationship that I couldn't go to and
Man033_Woman038_0266,they were make-or-break issues for both
Man033_Woman038_0267,of us then you know that would be that
Man033_Woman038_0268,and if your politics went far to the
Man033_Woman038_0269,right that would that would be a
Man033_Woman038_0270,deal-breaker you know cuz I know we're
Man033_Woman038_0271,under everybody's under the same
Man033_Woman038_0272,pressures in this warm society so it's
Man033_Woman038_0273,actually one of my fears is that you
Man033_Woman038_0274,know the society would warp your
Man033_Woman038_0275,politics
Man033_Woman038_0276,they would go far from watching your
Man033_Woman038_0277,voice do you really feel like we are
Man033_Woman038_0278,growing apart no I mean at this moment
Man033_Woman038_0279,no I mean I think that you know they
Man033_Woman038_0280,have been moment or having hard you know
Man033_Woman038_0281,like a when we live in Mexico those were
Man033_Woman038_0282,moms work very hard I would say that
Man033_Woman038_0283,probably was the hardest because I go
Man033_Woman038_0284,see and understand when you why you
Man033_Woman038_0285,couldn't feel like comfortable just
Man033_Woman038_0286,freelancing you know I feel having a
Man033_Woman038_0287,full-time job I thought it was super
Man033_Woman038_0288,cool you know but you know I probably
Man033_Woman038_0289,that was the hardest was the only time
Man033_Woman038_0290,that I was like well maybe after all
Man033_Woman038_0291,because like we understand where you're
Man033_Woman038_0292,coming from I was like oh maybe after
Man033_Woman038_0293,all we're not like a perfect yeah much
Man033_Woman038_0294,but I mean I don't feel like that I know
Man033_Woman038_0295,what about you know I feel that it
Man033_Woman038_0296,especially now that we are in agreement
Man033_Woman038_0297,on what we need to do about our health
Man033_Woman038_0298,and how housing situation that there's
Man033_Woman038_0299,not a potential rupture in that you know
Man033_Woman038_0300,I'm more wedded to the single family a
Man033_Woman038_0301,home ownership deal like maybe I was a
Man033_Woman038_0302,little bit cushy in that lifestyle a few
Man033_Woman038_0303,years ago I think the ordeal of this
Man033_Woman038_0304,winter and our heat issue has taught me
Man033_Woman038_0305,once and for all that we're more
Man033_Woman038_0306,important to be together than to be in a
Man033_Woman038_0307,in a home our categories as well even
Man033_Woman038_0308,though she doesn't want to go to a
Man033_Woman038_0309,smaller place I know is it your turn to
Man033_Woman038_0310,ask me wait sorry oh yeah yeah I'm sorry
Man033_Woman038_0311,sorry I'm getting ahead of myself who
Man033_Woman038_0312,has more power in the relationship you
Man033_Woman038_0313,or me that's well I think Penny's
Man033_Woman038_0314,husband Ryan said it best about their
Man033_Woman038_0315,relationship to me one time when he said
Man033_Woman038_0316,that she has veto power so I think that
Man033_Woman038_0317,when it comes to major major issues that
Man033_Woman038_0318,were divisive over I think that I would
Man033_Woman038_0319,defer to your do your desires more often
Man033_Woman038_0320,then then you know then mine I mean
Man033_Woman038_0321,there's some dude does come from time to
Man033_Woman038_0322,time something that I feel is extremely
Man033_Woman038_0323,extremely important and you know even if
Man033_Woman038_0324,I might backtrack initially you
Man033_Woman038_0325,no you know you're a very difficult Rock
Man033_Woman038_0326,to move on some boys you know I'll try
Man033_Woman038_0327,to come back to it and really try to
Man033_Woman038_0328,look at it from an empirical standpoint
Man033_Woman038_0329,that well you know what we tried it this
Man033_Woman038_0330,way and it didn't work so what's going
Man033_Woman038_0331,on with that but thank goodness we don't
Man033_Woman038_0332,have we a we don't have a car and have
Man033_Woman038_0333,to fight over directions and B when we
Man033_Woman038_0334,do have a car there's Google Maps to get
Man033_Woman038_0335,us to the to where we need to go but I
Man033_Woman038_0336,don't know I think I'd like I prefer to
Man033_Woman038_0337,be more compensating towards your your
Man033_Woman038_0338,your desires and and defer to you mainly
Man033_Woman038_0339,because I know in general in society
Man033_Woman038_0340,it teaches women to be subservient or
Man033_Woman038_0341,you know secondary to men and I'd like
Man033_Woman038_0342,to think in our relationship that you
Man033_Woman038_0343,feel that you know that you that you're
Man033_Woman038_0344,an equal or you know a little bit more
Man033_Woman038_0345,than an equal because you you know you
Man033_Woman038_0346,catch so much hell out in the real world
Man033_Woman038_0347,do you agree with that assessment well I
Man033_Woman038_0348,like it also when you joke when you told
Man033_Woman038_0349,you world or when he was married that
Man033_Woman038_0350,you said the only suggest device device
Man033_Woman038_0351,is always listen to the woman and never
Man033_Woman038_0352,try to voice what is what you'd like to
Man033_Woman038_0353,say never say anything after a fight
Man033_Woman038_0354,because it would be the beginning on
Man033_Woman038_0355,another argument
Man033_Woman038_0356,oh is the one rule is the woman always
Man033_Woman038_0357,has the last word in an argument because
Man033_Woman038_0358,anything that a man
Man033_Woman038_0359,after that is the beginning of a new
Man033_Woman038_0360,argument that's me you can read it if
Man033_Woman038_0361,you want since I all I know is you could
Man033_Woman038_0362,change one thing in our relationship
Man033_Woman038_0363,well what it will be and why I could
Man033_Woman038_0364,change one thing I think if I could
Man033_Woman038_0365,change one thing it would be to to have
Man033_Woman038_0366,come up front with you about my aversion
Man033_Woman038_0367,to financial planning so that that
Man033_Woman038_0368,wasn't something that you that was a
Man033_Woman038_0369,surprise to you I guess yeah I think
Man033_Woman038_0370,that would be the one thing you know to
Man033_Woman038_0371,be to have been candid with you about
Man033_Woman038_0372,that and if there's one thing that you
Man033_Woman038_0373,would like to change what would that be
Man033_Woman038_0374,maybe that you try a little more
Man033_Woman038_0375,different thing yes - don't be just to
Man033_Woman038_0376,kind of go with the flow when there are
Man033_Woman038_0377,suggestions put on the table you know
Man033_Woman038_0378,because one tiny happens you know think
Man033_Woman038_0379,that somebody will invite us somewhere
Man033_Woman038_0380,and you're like to be like hmm or just
Man033_Woman038_0381,to try something no you know studio and
