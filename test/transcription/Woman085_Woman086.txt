Woman085_Woman086_0001,what's the most fun you've had with me
Woman085_Woman086_0002,and why so many different times remember
Woman085_Woman086_0003,the time that like there's no new you
Woman085_Woman086_0004,force me to do yeah which video I don't
Woman085_Woman086_0005,know in general I just I always have a
Woman085_Woman086_0006,lot of fun do you want to ask it back
Woman085_Woman086_0007,when was the best time or the first time
Woman085_Woman086_0008,you said no because there's too many
Woman085_Woman086_0009,they're dispersed I can't think of one
Woman085_Woman086_0010,single one yeah but what what stands out
Woman085_Woman086_0011,I guess those I guess that same period
Woman085_Woman086_0012,when we were doing music videos and have
Woman085_Woman086_0013,people over and unique coordinated like
Woman085_Woman086_0014,a choreographed dances for everyone in a
Woman085_Woman086_0015,circle oh yeah this works okay when you
Woman085_Woman086_0016,think of the first time we met
Woman085_Woman086_0017,what do you remember well yeah so
Woman085_Woman086_0018,because you're 13 you're half my age now
Woman085_Woman086_0019,13 years younger than me so I saw you're
Woman085_Woman086_0020,a baby and I remember you're just spirit
Woman085_Woman086_0021,was very chill and easy to laugh left
Woman085_Woman086_0022,really easily and you're a very
Woman085_Woman086_0023,good-natured and we play volleyball with
Woman085_Woman086_0024,you this the ball tossing you back and
Woman085_Woman086_0025,forth with me in my ass that's one of my
Woman085_Woman086_0026,first memories but you liked them the
Woman085_Woman086_0027,hospital I just remember being really
Woman085_Woman086_0028,excited and you know so I don't thirteen
Woman085_Woman086_0029,yeah so I don't clear I don't have a
Woman085_Woman086_0030,clear memory of the moment I remember
Woman085_Woman086_0031,them I remember being in the hospital
Woman085_Woman086_0032,looking through the window and just you
Woman085_Woman086_0033,know what's the most ridiculous thing
Woman085_Woman086_0034,I've done and what did it teach you
Woman085_Woman086_0035,about me
Woman085_Woman086_0036,I can't think of anything ridiculous
Woman085_Woman086_0037,like you seem very you're very grounded
Woman085_Woman086_0038,to me I don't think you've ever really
Woman085_Woman086_0039,made like anything done anything too
Woman085_Woman086_0040,crazy in my life but in general I think
Woman085_Woman086_0041,in what I've learned about you is that
Woman085_Woman086_0042,you're very strong-willed and do you
Woman085_Woman086_0043,want to answer
Woman085_Woman086_0044,I can't I'm just thinking of something
Woman085_Woman086_0045,really ridiculous one but um I'd rather
Woman085_Woman086_0046,not say okay
Woman085_Woman086_0047,what do you think is special about our
Woman085_Woman086_0048,relationship well it always the kind of
Woman085_Woman086_0049,fascinates me that we have such a big
Woman085_Woman086_0050,age gap but we get along like at work
Woman085_Woman086_0051,we're friends so that's always really
Woman085_Woman086_0052,neat because you're kind of from a
Woman085_Woman086_0053,different generation and then and that
Woman085_Woman086_0054,we could talk about very heavy family
Woman085_Woman086_0055,matters sometimes or you know so-called
Woman085_Woman086_0056,issues but kind of laugh about it and
Woman085_Woman086_0057,find a like lightness to it all so
Woman085_Woman086_0058,that's really special to me you taught
Woman085_Woman086_0059,me that
Woman085_Woman086_0060,[Music]
Woman085_Woman086_0061,how about you I think what's special is
Woman085_Woman086_0062,the age gap in my perspective is like
Woman085_Woman086_0063,you were a mom kind of like you had more
Woman085_Woman086_0064,of a mother figure presence my life in
Woman085_Woman086_0065,the beginning and then I switch happened
Woman085_Woman086_0066,where we really felt like we were
Woman085_Woman086_0067,sisters and then now it's like
Woman085_Woman086_0068,yeah that combination of the three I
Woman085_Woman086_0069,think really special and really rare I
Woman085_Woman086_0070,think yeah I don't feel the age gap
Woman085_Woman086_0071,sometimes and I feel so grateful because
Woman085_Woman086_0072,you being so open with me I feel like
Woman085_Woman086_0073,I've sometimes one step ahead because I
Woman085_Woman086_0074,just imagine me at your age and
Woman085_Woman086_0075,sometimes I fast forward in my mind and
Woman085_Woman086_0076,I think about making if I were to make
Woman085_Woman086_0077,the similar decisions or I'm always
Woman085_Woman086_0078,putting myself in your shoes as far as
Woman085_Woman086_0079,like what it's like being a woman your
Woman085_Woman086_0080,age throughout my whole life so I'm
Woman085_Woman086_0081,always thinking I think it's giving me a
Woman085_Woman086_0082,lot of wisdom I'm not gonna do that I'm
Woman085_Woman086_0083,not gonna do and the cool thing about
Woman085_Woman086_0084,you too is you could us growing up in
Woman085_Woman086_0085,totally different generations is that
Woman085_Woman086_0086,you kind of gave me insight into like
Woman085_Woman086_0087,the 80 years like I feel like I would I
Woman085_Woman086_0088,lived through the eighties through but
Woman085_Woman086_0089,like the music and all the things that
Woman085_Woman086_0090,you guys used to do and like your prom I
Woman085_Woman086_0091,feel like I was there yeah but I wasn't
Woman085_Woman086_0092,even alive sometimes about some points
Woman085_Woman086_0093,yeah yeah maybe I should take this off
Woman085_Woman086_0094,because of the sound
Woman085_Woman086_0095,okay
Woman085_Woman086_0096,I mean what are you hesitant to tell me
Woman085_Woman086_0097,I think with everybody not just you I
Woman085_Woman086_0098,hesitate to like really show that
Woman085_Woman086_0099,anything is is like I don't want to show
Woman085_Woman086_0100,too to be too vulnerable I guess or feel
Woman085_Woman086_0101,like anybody needs to take care of me so
Woman085_Woman086_0102,I like avoid I don't want you to worry
Woman085_Woman086_0103,about me so sometimes I just tell you
Woman085_Woman086_0104,things that I may be too negative or too
Woman085_Woman086_0105,sad in my life is that why cuz you're
Woman085_Woman086_0106,scared I'll get worried yeah but it's
Woman085_Woman086_0107,but it's really with everyone and
Woman085_Woman086_0108,especially you especially anybody in my
Woman085_Woman086_0109,family you guys are older than me so
Woman085_Woman086_0110,it's like I don't wanna I don't like
Woman085_Woman086_0111,being worried about just sometimes when
Woman085_Woman086_0112,I share
Woman085_Woman086_0113,mm-hmm is that stifling in general yeah
Woman085_Woman086_0114,I think so yeah definitely it's
Woman085_Woman086_0115,something I need to work on because I
Woman085_Woman086_0116,think with age the problems get heavier
Woman085_Woman086_0117,you you realize like the things that you
Woman085_Woman086_0118,the way you dealt was like when you were
Woman085_Woman086_0119,younger just don't work when you're
Woman085_Woman086_0120,later again when you're older so I'm
Woman085_Woman086_0121,finding myself breaking at some points
Woman085_Woman086_0122,and needing help from people so it's
Woman085_Woman086_0123,like everything I know I feel well
Woman085_Woman086_0124,sometimes I don't tell you everything
Woman085_Woman086_0125,because why I tell you that don't I that
Woman085_Woman086_0126,I'm scared that I don't want to be heavy
Woman085_Woman086_0127,on you I don't want it to be you know to
Woman085_Woman086_0128,be burdensome what I want to add to your
Woman085_Woman086_0129,you know because especially being the
Woman085_Woman086_0130,older sister and being so much older
Woman085_Woman086_0131,than you know so I felt I filter myself
Woman085_Woman086_0132,but not not anymore I used to so I
Woman085_Woman086_0133,you've kind of reassured me you've
Woman085_Woman086_0134,convinced me that it's not is it
Woman085_Woman086_0135,it's a true well I think now we can
Woman085_Woman086_0136,relate more
Woman085_Woman086_0137,things really isn't about being older or
Woman085_Woman086_0138,younger yes a lot of things you're doing
Woman085_Woman086_0139,in your life now that I could choose to
Woman085_Woman086_0140,do right now if I wanted to yeah those
Woman085_Woman086_0141,are similar like artistic beliefs and
Woman085_Woman086_0142,like convictions about life so I think
Woman085_Woman086_0143,that was our break for conversation a
Woman085_Woman086_0144,limit on in the middle Paris right about
Woman085_Woman086_0145,that I'm not your mom changed everything
Woman085_Woman086_0146,but yeah cool all right who's next
Woman085_Woman086_0147,what's the greatest lesson I taught you
Woman085_Woman086_0148,to in generally to find humor in dark
Woman085_Woman086_0149,places I think it's just it's more of a
Woman085_Woman086_0150,way of being than a thing it's just
Woman085_Woman086_0151,watching you do that you understand our
Woman085_Woman086_0152,mother in a way that I took took me my
Woman085_Woman086_0153,whole life and you know and it's some
Woman085_Woman086_0154,and you're able to make to bring joy
Woman085_Woman086_0155,into you know what
Woman085_Woman086_0156,I used to kind of take it take on us
Woman085_Woman086_0157,sort of tragic and stuff so you you've
Woman085_Woman086_0158,helped me to to pretty to adopt that way
Woman085_Woman086_0159,of being and stuff so that's that's
Woman085_Woman086_0160,brought a lot of sunshine to my life and
Woman085_Woman086_0161,it still does so um she agrees yeah your
Woman085_Woman086_0162,sunshine yeah and now you're bringing
Woman085_Woman086_0163,sunshine
Woman085_Woman086_0164,[Music]
Woman085_Woman086_0165,okay with me yeah all right you know I
Woman085_Woman086_0166,want to answer that
Woman085_Woman086_0167,oh I want to ask all right let me put
Woman085_Woman086_0168,her just what's the what's the greatest
Woman085_Woman086_0169,lesson I taught you maybe think the RAF
Woman085_Woman086_0170,was better
Woman085_Woman086_0171,[Laughter]
Woman085_Woman086_0172,what's the Minnesota thing I would say I
Woman085_Woman086_0173,think one of your greatest qualities is
Woman085_Woman086_0174,your how discreet you are and your
Woman085_Woman086_0175,loyalty I think it's a beautiful thing
Woman085_Woman086_0176,to watch and to experience because
Woman085_Woman086_0177,you're so loyal to me and anybody that
Woman085_Woman086_0178,you love and you're so nurturing and
Woman085_Woman086_0179,ever since I was little very little
Woman085_Woman086_0180,because of our age gap I remember you
Woman085_Woman086_0181,being very attentive and very present
Woman085_Woman086_0182,and and that can that changes a child's
Woman085_Woman086_0183,life and anybody's life really but I
Woman085_Woman086_0184,remember you you're very concerned with
Woman085_Woman086_0185,the people that you love and even it
Woman085_Woman086_0186,shows so I kind of mimic like I think of
Woman085_Woman086_0187,it when I think about loyalty like
Woman085_Woman086_0188,standing strong next to somebody I think
Woman085_Woman086_0189,of you because there's something so
Woman085_Woman086_0190,consistent and transparent about you in
Woman085_Woman086_0191,the way that you I feel like I'll always
Woman085_Woman086_0192,have my back you will and you accept me
Woman085_Woman086_0193,as for me for who I am
Woman085_Woman086_0194,thank you it's your turn don't tell me
Woman085_Woman086_0195,what to do
Woman085_Woman086_0196,how do you think our families oh my god
Woman085_Woman086_0197,hey take time to answer this money or
Woman085_Woman086_0198,not how do you think our family's
Woman085_Woman086_0199,history has affected us we are family so
Woman085_Woman086_0200,it's pretty much I think that we both
Woman085_Woman086_0201,grew up somehow on one level or another
Woman085_Woman086_0202,without a father it's a strong
Woman085_Woman086_0203,consistent father figure I would say
Woman085_Woman086_0204,that and I think that United us I think
Woman085_Woman086_0205,mom definitely United us through music
Woman085_Woman086_0206,with her open-mindedness through her her
Woman085_Woman086_0207,pushing us to express ourselves
Woman085_Woman086_0208,to keep things as transparent as open as
Woman085_Woman086_0209,possible in the home so I think you know
Woman085_Woman086_0210,music art is self-expression and you
Woman085_Woman086_0211,know because of certain tragedies that's
Woman085_Woman086_0212,happened in our life you being so
Woman085_Woman086_0213,nurturing okay good so in like nurturing
Woman085_Woman086_0214,and caring towards me I think it was
Woman085_Woman086_0215,amplified a lot more because of
Woman085_Woman086_0216,everything that we go through it's
Woman085_Woman086_0217,actually we've gone through so much as a
Woman085_Woman086_0218,family and I don't think we realize it
Woman085_Woman086_0219,I've been so positive about it right
Woman085_Woman086_0220,what do you think you have to end
Woman085_Woman086_0221,you don't ask me every question I know
Woman085_Woman086_0222,but I think you put it really well I
Woman085_Woman086_0223,mean I agree with everything you said
Woman085_Woman086_0224,because you know I'm the one soy yeah
Woman085_Woman086_0225,yeah I did it did kind of put my our
Woman085_Woman086_0226,older sister night in it could put my
Woman085_Woman086_0227,and me into the role of kind of like
Woman085_Woman086_0228,more protector and second parent so but
Woman085_Woman086_0229,you know it was uh we did that with
Woman085_Woman086_0230,pleasure it wasn't a conscious thing
Woman085_Woman086_0231,anyway you know one kind of just stepped
Woman085_Woman086_0232,in where we had to and and stuff so I
Woman085_Woman086_0233,think yeah that that you know definitely
Woman085_Woman086_0234,that configuration mixed in with our own
Woman085_Woman086_0235,nature's you know affected the way that
Woman085_Woman086_0236,yeah that we bonded and you know the way
Woman085_Woman086_0237,we grew together for sure how am i most
Woman085_Woman086_0238,like you and what does that and happen
Woman085_Woman086_0239,how am I most like you and how does that
Woman085_Woman086_0240,scare you I think you're deeply
Woman085_Woman086_0241,emotional like me you know except you
Woman085_Woman086_0242,you don't necessarily express it in the
Woman085_Woman086_0243,same way
Woman085_Woman086_0244,can't the baby twosome
Woman085_Woman086_0245,oh yeah maybe she plays with my hair
Woman085_Woman086_0246,she'll be quiet for a long time okay so
Woman085_Woman086_0247,I think you're deeply emotional like I
Woman085_Woman086_0248,am but I think you relate to that
Woman085_Woman086_0249,differently I mean you know you're in a
Woman085_Woman086_0250,way or more oh we're both shy but in
Woman085_Woman086_0251,different ways I think and yeah I think
Woman085_Woman086_0252,you have a lot of water in your in your
Woman085_Woman086_0253,nature as well even though you're you
Woman085_Woman086_0254,act all tough and funny which you are
Woman085_Woman086_0255,also but um I think maybe that's the way
Woman085_Woman086_0256,we're most similar yeah like your
Woman085_Woman086_0257,approach our approach to art yeah yeah
Woman085_Woman086_0258,that's right
Woman085_Woman086_0259,our greater philosophy of life I think
Woman085_Woman086_0260,is a really similar can you say it some
Woman085_Woman086_0261,more about them you tell me no you said
Woman085_Woman086_0262,it well you actually you taught me it
Woman085_Woman086_0263,was so hard because that's a big thing
Woman085_Woman086_0264,what you expose me to profound musicians
Woman085_Woman086_0265,and profound writers and poets at a very
Woman085_Woman086_0266,young age
Woman085_Woman086_0267,when you were like oh yeah I could get a
Woman085_Woman086_0268,good job you can put some
Woman085_Woman086_0269,thank you you've chosen like I was 10
Woman085_Woman086_0270,years old and you were showing me Ben
Woman085_Woman086_0271,Harper Jeff Buckley music from the 1870s
Woman085_Woman086_0272,okay
Woman085_Woman086_0273,in yeah you should only you exposed me
Woman085_Woman086_0274,they're like mysticism and Sufism like
Woman085_Woman086_0275,some of the greatest poets Rumi for
Woman085_Woman086_0276,example is really like reflects a lot of
Woman085_Woman086_0277,my philosophies in life and and the
Woman085_Woman086_0278,greatest thing you always used to ask me
Woman085_Woman086_0279,since I was little and the people the
Woman085_Woman086_0280,type of people and artists that you're
Woman085_Woman086_0281,attracted to are people that show a very
Woman085_Woman086_0282,strong sense of purpose and are
Woman085_Woman086_0283,individualistic in their expression so
Woman085_Woman086_0284,you always used to ask me that question
Woman085_Woman086_0285,and I think I'm a little bit more
Woman085_Woman086_0286,scatterbrain than you and a little bit I
Woman085_Woman086_0287,can get a little bit spread too thin
Woman085_Woman086_0288,because I get excited about a lot of
Woman085_Woman086_0289,different things it doesn't mean you're
Woman085_Woman086_0290,scattering though yeah just interested
Woman085_Woman086_0291,in a more diverse I know but you will
Woman085_Woman086_0292,you push me to dig deeper and certain
Woman085_Woman086_0293,things that I love and it's always been
Woman085_Woman086_0294,so rewarding
Woman085_Woman086_0295,especially with my art and with music in
Woman085_Woman086_0296,general nothing that's your nature as
Woman085_Woman086_0297,well you know it's not anything that
Woman085_Woman086_0298,anyone put into you but it's just that
Woman085_Woman086_0299,it was there already so it's just I
Woman085_Woman086_0300,guess you know waiting to be seen and to
Woman085_Woman086_0301,be you know well that's the thing you're
Woman085_Woman086_0302,the first to see it in my life you know
Woman085_Woman086_0303,what I mean like that's profound for you
Woman085_Woman086_0304,to be so attentive and present to me and
Woman085_Woman086_0305,like even though you did reject in the
Woman085_Woman086_0306,beginning room I did hi that was a lot
Woman085_Woman086_0307,there's some things it was too much but
Woman085_Woman086_0308,how old are you and I thought I was like
Woman085_Woman086_0309,10 and you fell asleep
Woman085_Woman086_0310,she's pretty really pretty really scary
Woman085_Woman086_0311,moved me on she's like me the
Woman085_Woman086_0312,existential stuff you know that now I
Woman085_Woman086_0313,understand my birth
Woman085_Woman086_0314,all right okay Susie is it my turn funny
Woman085_Woman086_0315,okay no is that yeah I don't know it's
Woman085_Woman086_0316,that with me that just did it okay when
Woman085_Woman086_0317,or what was the toughest moment in our
Woman085_Woman086_0318,relationship
Woman085_Woman086_0319,toughest is relative I really don't
Woman085_Woman086_0320,think we really had any tough times in
Woman085_Woman086_0321,our lives in a relationship I would say
Woman085_Woman086_0322,just transitioning from like you being a
Woman085_Woman086_0323,mother figure to me
Woman085_Woman086_0324,and you also seeing seeing yourself as a
Woman085_Woman086_0325,mother figure to me to becoming my
Woman085_Woman086_0326,sister mm-hmm like a really good friend
Woman085_Woman086_0327,yeah I think I felt that was
Woman085_Woman086_0328,life-changing
Woman085_Woman086_0329,yeah yeah
Woman085_Woman086_0330,and I feel like we're like this like Cup
Woman085_Woman086_0331,I feel like we're very complementary we
Woman085_Woman086_0332,have such a strong foundation of trust
Woman085_Woman086_0333,there's things that are similar about us
Woman085_Woman086_0334,but when I think we're more different
Woman085_Woman086_0335,and I think we learned so much from each
Woman085_Woman086_0336,other because we're honest with each
Woman085_Woman086_0337,other and we have such a strong
Woman085_Woman086_0338,foundation of trust what would you say I
Woman085_Woman086_0339,think just a moment was kind of just
Woman085_Woman086_0340,brief moments here and there like when
Woman085_Woman086_0341,we were roommates recently and then
Woman085_Woman086_0342,uh-huh
Woman085_Woman086_0343,and I wanted to take care of you make
Woman085_Woman086_0344,you soup that meet that unwire why that
Woman085_Woman086_0345,mean
Woman085_Woman086_0346,yeah like giving you your space or not
Woman085_Woman086_0347,worrying about you I have to remember to
Woman085_Woman086_0348,not do that sometimes to give your space
Woman085_Woman086_0349,and not to worry so it's like it's still
Woman085_Woman086_0350,an effort but it's good when I remember
Woman085_Woman086_0351,so yeah so I think those what else is
Woman085_Woman086_0352,there anything else you like when did I
Woman085_Woman086_0353,hate you yeah
Woman085_Woman086_0354,it's a weird question what did you learn
Woman085_Woman086_0355,from your parents that you wish you
Woman085_Woman086_0356,could forget I guess they're things that
Woman085_Woman086_0357,I don't necessarily agree with or that
Woman085_Woman086_0358,that I've you know grown out of or that
Woman085_Woman086_0359,I have a different view on it's not so
Woman085_Woman086_0360,much that I want to forget but maybe
Woman085_Woman086_0361,that life's a struggle or that things
Woman085_Woman086_0362,have to be painful or hard or overly
Woman085_Woman086_0363,dramatic or something like that I think
Woman085_Woman086_0364,just having both to two artists as
Woman085_Woman086_0365,parents was like you know there's a lot
Woman085_Woman086_0366,of that a lot of suffering I think you
Woman085_Woman086_0367,know know who you might as say it's
Woman085_Woman086_0368,unnecessary but I think that's the
Woman085_Woman086_0369,biggest thing that I've been working on
Woman085_Woman086_0370,shedding and you know you've been a big
Woman085_Woman086_0371,part of that kind of curing myself from
Woman085_Woman086_0372,that you know is watching you and just
Woman085_Woman086_0373,having a good time together and all the
Woman085_Woman086_0374,laughter you know that that's generated
Woman085_Woman086_0375,and just like you know just to focus
Woman085_Woman086_0376,more on Joey and lightness not trying to
Woman085_Woman086_0377,figure everything out or have to you
Woman085_Woman086_0378,know to feel like yeah I wish to earn
Woman085_Woman086_0379,happiness you know we could just kind of
Woman085_Woman086_0380,be back and enjoy life more easily
Woman085_Woman086_0381,how about you okay do you do do you want
Woman085_Woman086_0382,to do you want to take her but not
Woman085_Woman086_0383,anything that I would forget okay just
Woman085_Woman086_0384,the first part then my parents I love
Woman085_Woman086_0385,their or something that you that but
Woman085_Woman086_0386,that you would want to change yeah that
Woman085_Woman086_0387,you learned but that you don't
Woman085_Woman086_0388,necessarily a doctor that you take put
Woman085_Woman086_0389,your own twist on oh I don't know I all
Woman085_Woman086_0390,I know is that the most thing that
Woman085_Woman086_0391,inspires me but them to like their
Woman085_Woman086_0392,dynamic is their level of trust mom but
Woman085_Woman086_0393,I think it was so profound and I think
Woman085_Woman086_0394,they were like intellectually a good
Woman085_Woman086_0395,match and their trust of each other or
Woman085_Woman086_0396,other children they really like a it's
Woman085_Woman086_0397,cool a really cool duo and and they were
Woman085_Woman086_0398,both concerned with like larger
Woman085_Woman086_0399,principles of life much larger than them
Woman085_Woman086_0400,mm-hmm and I think that's incredible
Woman085_Woman086_0401,it's like the most inspiring thing and
Woman085_Woman086_0402,the fact that they were brought together
Woman085_Woman086_0403,in the world to do to help each other
