Man041_Woman046_0001,I gotta get this guy to stop
Man041_Woman046_0002,thinking I really won't
Man041_Woman046_0003,[Laughter]
Man041_Woman046_0004,when you think about the first time we
Man041_Woman046_0005,met what do you remember I remember that
Man041_Woman046_0006,the first date was not great that's
Man041_Woman046_0007,right it was good but it wasn't great
Man041_Woman046_0008,you were in a suit that did not fit you
Man041_Woman046_0009,very well that's right it was really
Man041_Woman046_0010,large pretty awkward you're actually you
Man041_Woman046_0011,weren't very awkward you were just you
Man041_Woman046_0012,weren't comfortable so I think I that I
Man041_Woman046_0013,also then you were so excited to go to
Man041_Woman046_0014,still argue that was good but then I
Man041_Woman046_0015,left that date to go on a different date
Man041_Woman046_0016,and that date was not as good meeting
Man041_Woman046_0017,friends with girlfriends
Man041_Woman046_0018,more specifically typically no I'm not
Man041_Woman046_0019,leaving you
Man041_Woman046_0020,your first date to go on another first
Man041_Woman046_0021,date but that's what I did he sucked
Man041_Woman046_0022,I'm never his name I remember he worked
Man041_Woman046_0023,for like a hedge fund or something no
Man041_Woman046_0024,you were first startup he's a start-up
Man041_Woman046_0025,guy whatever it doesn't matter cuz I
Man041_Woman046_0026,don't know his name and I thought at the
Man041_Woman046_0027,end of the first date I was like you
Man041_Woman046_0028,know what I don't know if this will be a
Man041_Woman046_0029,match but at least we both love great
Man041_Woman046_0030,food and I need a really good restaurant
Man041_Woman046_0031,buddy and so we're gonna go and find
Man041_Woman046_0032,amazing food that was my goal what was
Man041_Woman046_0033,your
Man041_Woman046_0034,I feel like at the end of the first date
Man041_Woman046_0035,how this shit I just felt like I had a
Man041_Woman046_0036,good time and at that point I had no
Man041_Woman046_0037,particular expectations many of the
Man041_Woman046_0038,dates that I was going on it was like of
Man041_Woman046_0039,course me and our show together so I had
Man041_Woman046_0040,a stable relationship and was bonus as
Man041_Woman046_0041,opposed to being right but have you been
Man041_Woman046_0042,on many dates at that point probably not
Man041_Woman046_0043,nearly as many as afterwards yeah so it
Man041_Woman046_0044,wasn't like oh my god I finally found a
Man041_Woman046_0045,girl who will go on a date with me oh it
Man041_Woman046_0046,was I think I think the fact that you
Man041_Woman046_0047,messaged me versus like versus vice
Man041_Woman046_0048,versa
Man041_Woman046_0049,probably gave me more hope because I
Man041_Woman046_0050,feel like every time was dude girl
Man041_Woman046_0051,stepping up to me rather than the ones
Man041_Woman046_0052,where I step up to them right
Man041_Woman046_0053,but you had messaged me but that was a
Man041_Woman046_0054,year before and I didn't reply to him I
Man041_Woman046_0055,said I didn't like your photos actually
Man041_Woman046_0056,I can't say it was wrong because it
Man041_Woman046_0057,wasn't that I was ready to meet you a
Man041_Woman046_0058,year previous probably clean everything
Man041_Woman046_0059,so I had to go on my slut arc to meet
Man041_Woman046_0060,you at the bottom sure what's your
Man041_Woman046_0061,favorite thing about me in all
Man041_Woman046_0062,seriousness my favorite thing about you
Man041_Woman046_0063,is the fact that you intellectual
Man041_Woman046_0064,like don't get me wrong like I think
Man041_Woman046_0065,you're pretty and I love the sex we have
Man041_Woman046_0066,and there's a ton of things that are
Man041_Woman046_0067,great about you but like the fact that
Man041_Woman046_0068,you actually offer me interesting
Man041_Woman046_0069,conversation and forced me to rethink
Man041_Woman046_0070,perspective is far more valuable to me
Man041_Woman046_0071,than any one of those other things I
Man041_Woman046_0072,agree that's a good answer
Man041_Woman046_0073,let's see I think it's pretty similar I
Man041_Woman046_0074,think it's I think it has yeah I think
Man041_Woman046_0075,it's pretty similar because I'm always
Man041_Woman046_0076,looking for people that push me and you
Man041_Woman046_0077,push me actually you push me physically
Man041_Woman046_0078,you push me intellectually you push me
Man041_Woman046_0079,in you know how I think about things and
Man041_Woman046_0080,and like we did a Tough Mudder together
Man041_Woman046_0081,and I hadn't run a 5k and then you're
Man041_Woman046_0082,like let's go on a 12-mile obstacle
Man041_Woman046_0083,course and fall off a multi-story
Man041_Woman046_0084,building into a pond and get
Man041_Woman046_0085,electrocuted in the mind like okay but
Man041_Woman046_0086,we did that and then I should need a
Man041_Woman046_0087,Burning Man you had no idea what was
Man041_Woman046_0088,gonna happen at Burning Man but you were
Man041_Woman046_0089,like okay and so having that amount of
Man041_Woman046_0090,trust and faith in the other person I
Man041_Woman046_0091,think is really really my favorite thing
Man041_Woman046_0092,about you is that I know that I'm
Man041_Woman046_0093,completely safe and supported at the
Man041_Woman046_0094,same time and so we can do really really
Man041_Woman046_0095,interesting Thanks I can't yeah okay I
Man041_Woman046_0096,can't say that like I can't say I would
Man041_Woman046_0097,never imagine that scuba diving
Man041_Woman046_0098,certified it's like an exercise interest
Man041_Woman046_0099,like hello person I might die underwater
Man041_Woman046_0100,and then you have to rescue me
Man041_Woman046_0101,let's practice I just hope your turn
Man041_Woman046_0102,good at flashcards what do you love
Man041_Woman046_0103,about our relationship
Man041_Woman046_0104,interesting I don't know I have whole
Man041_Woman046_0105,matrix of things all right high level
Man041_Woman046_0106,high level goes back to being challenged
Man041_Woman046_0107,challenging each other and then next
Man041_Woman046_0108,level I think comes out of love and
Man041_Woman046_0109,trust and security and I think it's a
Man041_Woman046_0110,challenge so the interesting thing about
Man041_Woman046_0111,challenge to each other is that there's
Man041_Woman046_0112,things we do together yeah just like
Man041_Woman046_0113,what I said the things we do together
Man041_Woman046_0114,but I wouldn't have done otherwise
Man041_Woman046_0115,that's really neat to know climb a
Man041_Woman046_0116,mountain higher than you'll ever live by
Man041_Woman046_0117,yourself because the other person's they
Man041_Woman046_0118,are climbing with you and you're like
Man041_Woman046_0119,alright well if they can do it then I
Man041_Woman046_0120,can do it and that we kind of push each
Man041_Woman046_0121,other to succeed that way is my favorite
Man041_Woman046_0122,part
Man041_Woman046_0123,that's right to me I think that we I
Man041_Woman046_0124,think the thing maybe the way I would
Man041_Woman046_0125,say it is that like I really like I love
Man041_Woman046_0126,about our relationship that I feel like
Man041_Woman046_0127,you're trying to push me to be the best
Man041_Woman046_0128,me I can be receptive to the same yeah I
Man041_Woman046_0129,love it autumn is just like holding each
Man041_Woman046_0130,other accountable like it's really easy
Man041_Woman046_0131,to say I want to do this in five years
Man041_Woman046_0132,it's really hard to do that unless
Man041_Woman046_0133,there's someone checking in and being
Man041_Woman046_0134,like so how are you gonna get that done
Man041_Woman046_0135,in five years if haven't started yet so
Man041_Woman046_0136,it's good just to have that checkpoint
Man041_Woman046_0137,sure I think I think I value the
Man041_Woman046_0138,partnership just as much not gonna like
Man041_Woman046_0139,you if you keep rubbing your microphone
Man041_Woman046_0140,when do you feel closest to me besides
Man041_Woman046_0141,when I fuck you in the ass I think I
Man041_Woman046_0142,feel closest to you more relaxed came in
Man041_Woman046_0143,through the window
Man041_Woman046_0144,vacations we're so good at vacation do
Man041_Woman046_0145,what I do believe we can come back have
Man041_Woman046_0146,a nap have more sex go do another
Man041_Woman046_0147,activity they come back and have sex and
Man041_Woman046_0148,go to sleep
Man041_Woman046_0149,that is awesome vacation how am I going
Man041_Woman046_0150,to tell you man we did enter therapy
Man041_Woman046_0151,really quick here
Man041_Woman046_0152,[Music]
Man041_Woman046_0153,now we don't have a lot of things like
Man041_Woman046_0154,that that's really interesting that's
Man041_Woman046_0155,like way I think I think it's really I
Man041_Woman046_0156,think what's difficult color that I
Man041_Woman046_0157,hesitate about is what are the next
Man041_Woman046_0158,steps in a relationship like that
Man041_Woman046_0159,because we're not a big fan of
Man041_Woman046_0160,traditional marriage vows and so there's
Man041_Woman046_0161,a lot of there's like you start dating
Man041_Woman046_0162,and then you move in with each other and
Man041_Woman046_0163,then you get married and it's like
Man041_Woman046_0164,they're supposed to be this progression
Man041_Woman046_0165,and that's not going to be our
Man041_Woman046_0166,progression but I still feel that
Man041_Woman046_0167,outside pressure to look like I'm having
Man041_Woman046_0168,that progression you're saying I think I
Man041_Woman046_0169,was hesitant to you know like we moved
Man041_Woman046_0170,into each other and then we moved out so
Man041_Woman046_0171,it seemed like we were going back a step
Man041_Woman046_0172,and so I guess I'm hesitant to figure
Man041_Woman046_0173,out how do you I don't I don't know how
Man041_Woman046_0174,you progress this or if there is I
Man041_Woman046_0175,progressed to figure think I at first I
Man041_Woman046_0176,was I was like where it is what I think
Man041_Woman046_0177,of it is like probably attaching too
Man041_Woman046_0178,much the question is like I'm not
Man041_Woman046_0179,anything anymore right I mean I think
Man041_Woman046_0180,that there are moments of jealousy about
Man041_Woman046_0181,other partners or stuff like that that
Man041_Woman046_0182,hit me and that I struggle with because
Man041_Woman046_0183,I want deeply to feel as happy for you
Man041_Woman046_0184,as you know you seem to feel for me all
Man041_Woman046_0185,the time yeah so that's maybe something
Man041_Woman046_0186,I struggle with talking about because I
Man041_Woman046_0187,feel that I'm it's like a character
Man041_Woman046_0188,weakness that I'm revealing about myself
Man041_Woman046_0189,I don't feel worried about telling you
Man041_Woman046_0190,stuff I think I was hesitant to tell you
Man041_Woman046_0191,to break up with one of the girls once
Man041_Woman046_0192,but she was a nightmare and you knew you
Man041_Woman046_0193,had to break up with her anyway
Man041_Woman046_0194,sure but I hesitated because I didn't
Man041_Woman046_0195,want to be that wasn't my call to make
Man041_Woman046_0196,that was your call to make whether or
Man041_Woman046_0197,not you were gonna spend time with this
Man041_Woman046_0198,person but you made the right decisions
Man041_Woman046_0199,[Laughter]
Man041_Woman046_0200,that might be true because I would just
Man041_Woman046_0201,see how miserable you were interacting
Man041_Woman046_0202,with her yeah there was no rescuing that
Man041_Woman046_0203,[Laughter]
Man041_Woman046_0204,if you could change one thing in our
Man041_Woman046_0205,relationship what would it be and why
Man041_Woman046_0206,therapy questions right if I could
Man041_Woman046_0207,change one thing in our relationship I
Man041_Woman046_0208,would maybe this is dodging the question
Man041_Woman046_0209,so like I'll answer if you think it is
Man041_Woman046_0210,but I would empower you to not feel as
Man041_Woman046_0211,call it judged by not by things like not
Man041_Woman046_0212,getting in the school to you but you
Man041_Woman046_0213,take it harder than you should
Man041_Woman046_0214,that's not our relationship that's
Man041_Woman046_0215,something you change about me okay
Man041_Woman046_0216,it's hard it's hard the moment to just
Man041_Woman046_0217,like randomly summon was what's true you
Man041_Woman046_0218,starting the answer and let me ponder
Man041_Woman046_0219,well there's logistical thing he's like
Man041_Woman046_0220,I wish you didn't have to wake up as
Man041_Woman046_0221,early in the morning I think oh sure
Man041_Woman046_0222,that's again that's not really it
Man041_Woman046_0223,affects our relationships would I have
Man041_Woman046_0224,to go to bed at 10 o'clock episodes you
Man041_Woman046_0225,being upset by yeah I feel there's
Man041_Woman046_0226,probably an answer this question that
Man041_Woman046_0227,I'm just not summoning right now
Man041_Woman046_0228,maybe I would for morale for maybe I
Man041_Woman046_0229,would have there's a degree of I just
Man041_Woman046_0230,want to pay happier we do fine and
Man041_Woman046_0231,there's probably just like a utility
Man041_Woman046_0232,thing I might you like to be the most of
Man041_Woman046_0233,something it's just part of the fun when
Man041_Woman046_0234,it came to even choose the apartment I
Man041_Woman046_0235,live it it's just super competitive
Man041_Woman046_0236,nature ya know like we have to have the
Man041_Woman046_0237,most parties this somewhere in case we
Man041_Woman046_0238,don't have that apartment the most
Man041_Woman046_0239,parties I think the reason why we work
Man041_Woman046_0240,is because the answer that question
Man041_Woman046_0241,traits off and I think when there's one
Man041_Woman046_0242,power dynamic that can rapidly become
Man041_Woman046_0243,one-sided or one person always feels
Man041_Woman046_0244,like there's a trade-off I think the
Man041_Woman046_0245,fact that we have alternative sex trades
Man041_Woman046_0246,off the parish I'm very sure yeah I
Man041_Woman046_0247,think it's also that it's not all about
Man041_Woman046_0248,I think we both bring an equal amount of
Man041_Woman046_0249,things to relationship but you know it's
Man041_Woman046_0250,not all about always entertaining your
Man041_Woman046_0251,friends are always entertaining my
Man041_Woman046_0252,it's like we trade that off or it's not
Man041_Woman046_0253,all about your career or my career
Man041_Woman046_0254,there's a lot of we talk about both
Man041_Woman046_0255,things equally or whatever we value both
Man041_Woman046_0256,equally I think that if you netted out
Man041_Woman046_0257,you might say that mostly we're even but
Man041_Woman046_0258,there's probably some shift that you
Man041_Woman046_0259,think exists where you think you could
Man041_Woman046_0260,well there's different things that you
Man041_Woman046_0261,and I are better at but it's not that's
Man041_Woman046_0262,the thing yeah great and rather than
Man041_Woman046_0263,looking at this like I have to be as
Man041_Woman046_0264,good as you at everything you look at it
Man041_Woman046_0265,more like more as if you can either play
Man041_Woman046_0266,compliments or guardrail each other and
Man041_Woman046_0267,the stuff that you're bad at right it's
Man041_Woman046_0268,not about like I'm the best driver so
Man041_Woman046_0269,I'm always gonna drive or you're the
Man041_Woman046_0270,best driver it's like nah I Drive in the
Man041_Woman046_0271,city and you drive in the country we are
Man041_Woman046_0272,selectively that's the best medium I
Man041_Woman046_0273,think we're super I think we're super
Man041_Woman046_0274,logical about a lot of things and that
Man041_Woman046_0275,means there's not it's not about a Power
Man041_Woman046_0276,Balance necessarily like if I had the if
Man041_Woman046_0277,I had argue you probably have
Man041_Woman046_0278,but I would argue you have more
Man041_Woman046_0279,emotional power over me
Man041_Woman046_0280,I certainly have more like physical
Man041_Woman046_0281,power in the relationship but that
Man041_Woman046_0282,doesn't really sway me like if it
Man041_Woman046_0283,doesn't matter yes you can hold me down
Man041_Woman046_0284,I'd have to tie you up
Man041_Woman046_0285,I said school oh fiscal
Man041_Woman046_0286,[Laughter]
Man041_Woman046_0287,you
Man041_Woman046_0288,am I the best sex you've ever had yes
Man041_Woman046_0289,you're more experimental than I have
Man041_Woman046_0290,girl ever had not every attribute of
Man041_Woman046_0291,what we do together is the absolute Beth
Man041_Woman046_0292,but like the total package is easily the
Man041_Woman046_0293,best yes I agree no at first it wasn't
Man041_Woman046_0294,because I was seven years in a previous
Man041_Woman046_0295,relationship and the sex that you can
Man041_Woman046_0296,build and that is would surpass what we
Man041_Woman046_0297,did but say like eight months in it was
Man041_Woman046_0298,the best sex I ever had I stayed in that
Man041_Woman046_0299,relation forever that always that that
Man041_Woman046_0300,gave me a lot of the insecurities that I
Man041_Woman046_0301,have had have about our relationship is
Man041_Woman046_0302,the fact that you index yes
Man041_Woman046_0303,not every single thing that we do
Man041_Woman046_0304,together is the best thing that I've
Man041_Woman046_0305,ever had in that category but I've had
Man041_Woman046_0306,girls that have given me better head
Man041_Woman046_0307,than you mal in particular is just
Man041_Woman046_0308,exceptional that's the thing I'm and
Man041_Woman046_0309,it's fine
Man041_Woman046_0310,I think it's just that I need to give
Man041_Woman046_0311,you like more clear about what like I'm
Man041_Woman046_0312,not really reluctant to do that thing
Man041_Woman046_0313,but in the moment stop that do it this
Man041_Woman046_0314,yeah I mean I think our sex Alice yeah
Man041_Woman046_0315,doubling the best but it wasn't at the
Man041_Woman046_0316,beginning so that's okay there's a
Man041_Woman046_0317,learning period there's a ramp up time
Man041_Woman046_0318,we had to try on things I think sure I
Man041_Woman046_0319,like that we keep adding new things so I
Man041_Woman046_0320,think that's the best part about that
Man041_Woman046_0321,goes back to the pushing each other
Man041_Woman046_0322,thing yeah I think it's also the best
Man041_Woman046_0323,part about having other partners here
Man041_Woman046_0324,and there is like because it's like and
Man041_Woman046_0325,I think sex can get I think when I when
Man041_Woman046_0326,I was in high school first discovered
Man041_Woman046_0327,sex like it wasn't as much about okay
Man041_Woman046_0328,sex is just this action so it's like all
Man041_Woman046_0329,right let's do it weird places because
Man041_Woman046_0330,that's as creative as we could get it
Man041_Woman046_0331,like let's go to the park it has tank
Man041_Woman046_0332,boat add things glad you've moved past
Man041_Woman046_0333,that too much as much as outdoors is
Man041_Woman046_0334,great outdoors right now is not do we
Man041_Woman046_0335,have enough sex yes just there oh shit
Man041_Woman046_0336,how much more should we do to put you in
Man041_Woman046_0337,this firmly satisfied capable category
Man041_Woman046_0338,because I want to rise to the occasion I
Man041_Woman046_0339,want to make sure that we're in me like
Man041_Woman046_0340,firmly satisfied in category I I figured
Man041_Woman046_0341,like the average of eight to ten times a
Man041_Woman046_0342,week would be sufficient but I am okay
Man041_Woman046_0343,with more
Man041_Woman046_0344,I think it is I think scheduling would
Man041_Woman046_0345,not allow more no we would prefer to be
Man041_Woman046_0346,fucking at least twice a day sure
Man041_Woman046_0347,so if you want this tally to rise to 14
Man041_Woman046_0348,I just got to build more time in onset
Man041_Woman046_0349,if there was some act that you'd like to
Man041_Woman046_0350,try but we're afraid is there some act
Man041_Woman046_0351,you'd like to try boo you're afraid
Man041_Woman046_0352,would freak me out
Man041_Woman046_0353,no and I'm pretty sure anything I want
Man041_Woman046_0354,to try you would give a shot I'll answer
Man041_Woman046_0355,a slightly different question and say
Man041_Woman046_0356,that okay it I wish although I'm not
Man041_Woman046_0357,actually particularly sad about the fact
Man041_Woman046_0358,that you don't like pain which means
Man041_Woman046_0359,that I can't I can't do all the things I
Man041_Woman046_0360,like to do but yeah that's part of
Man041_Woman046_0361,having multiple partners anyway yeah I
Man041_Woman046_0362,think when I took you to a sex party on
Man041_Woman046_0363,our tenth date it's like okay we pull
Man041_Woman046_0364,this out on the 10th day
Man041_Woman046_0365,the trajectory it's my turn why aren't
Man041_Woman046_0366,we living together
Man041_Woman046_0367,the answer is we basically are but
Man041_Woman046_0368,double the price am i right so that
Man041_Woman046_0369,doesn't mean anything
Man041_Woman046_0370,we need the storage space that that I
Man041_Woman046_0371,believe that's why we don't but that's
Man041_Woman046_0372,why we have separate apartments and I
Man041_Woman046_0373,think the honest answer right now is
Man041_Woman046_0374,more we're waiting to see what happens
Man041_Woman046_0375,with schools and potential new job
Man041_Woman046_0376,yeah that'll decide where the fuck if
Man041_Woman046_0377,you go if you get into Yale or you come
Man041_Woman046_0378,work at the same place I work that we're
Man041_Woman046_0379,getting a fucking crash pad and
Man041_Woman046_0380,Connecticut fuck this shit I also love
Man041_Woman046_0381,my roommate sure why am I your primary
Man041_Woman046_0382,partner we gotta figure out better words
Man041_Woman046_0383,for a primary partner it's convenient
Man041_Woman046_0384,but I don't you you actually were the
Man041_Woman046_0385,one you didn't like the word originally
Man041_Woman046_0386,and it made me think about it long it's
Man041_Woman046_0387,not a great word so the answer the
Man041_Woman046_0388,reason I put you rather than digress on
Man041_Woman046_0389,sorry I think was to like your first for
Man041_Woman046_0390,me because you are the partner whom I
Man041_Woman046_0391,trust the most and the partner whom I
Man041_Woman046_0392,think will push me the most and the one
Man041_Woman046_0393,who I connect with deepest yeah that's
Man041_Woman046_0394,that is what the differentiate like
Man041_Woman046_0395,you're the person I would want to move
Man041_Woman046_0396,with me to another state you are the
Man041_Woman046_0397,best way for and I've ever had that's
Man041_Woman046_0398,good as much as I like Jack as a person
Man041_Woman046_0399,why did you get jealous last time and
Man041_Woman046_0400,how did you feel so the last time I was
Man041_Woman046_0401,jealous was when this is maybe a year
Man041_Woman046_0402,ago and you were being militant about us
Man041_Woman046_0403,going to bed at 10 o'clock and if I
Man041_Woman046_0404,wasn't in bed by 10 o'clock I was not
Man041_Woman046_0405,gonna get laid and that happened but I
Man041_Woman046_0406,had known that that we previous or
Man041_Woman046_0407,something that you'd gone out on a date
Man041_Woman046_0408,and you had fucked her after 10 o'clock
Man041_Woman046_0409,it was a de broglie's unfair
Man041_Woman046_0410,I couldn't get laid after 10 o'clock but
Man041_Woman046_0411,first date girls I don't know if she was
Man041_Woman046_0412,a first date but other girl kind so that
Man041_Woman046_0413,definitely happened and I think at the
Man041_Woman046_0414,time I mean I still think this is true I
Man041_Woman046_0415,argued but rather I think at the time
Man041_Woman046_0416,and I think this still holds water
Man041_Woman046_0417,rather like a if I don't like I can't I
Man041_Woman046_0418,can only see some of these people like
Man041_Woman046_0419,once a month and B that was way early on
Man041_Woman046_0420,of my adjustment from working from home
Man041_Woman046_0421,and waking up at 8 a.m. if I wanted to
Man041_Woman046_0422,versus working in Connecticut and having
Man041_Woman046_0423,to wake up at 6 every day so it was very
Man041_Woman046_0424,much early in that thing but to answer
Man041_Woman046_0425,my side of the question
Man041_Woman046_0426,I get jealous because I'm insecure about
Man041_Woman046_0427,it about the relationship sometimes I
Man041_Woman046_0428,could jealous because I feel like you
Man041_Woman046_0429,have especially early on articulated
Man041_Woman046_0430,like a set of things that made the
Man041_Woman046_0431,relationship great and I felt like that
Man041_Woman046_0432,was a set of things that could be
Man041_Woman046_0433,eclipsed by another person without like
Man041_Woman046_0434,and so I felt like there's an insecurity
Man041_Woman046_0435,around you going out with
Man041_Woman046_0436,that I feel it's one of those things
Man041_Woman046_0437,that I feel like I just had to work
Man041_Woman046_0438,through because honestly like the higher
Man041_Woman046_0439,part of me just feels conversion for you
Man041_Woman046_0440,and I just want I want that thing to be
Man041_Woman046_0441,the thing and not I want to eliminate
Man041_Woman046_0442,the jealousy part and I think that I got
Man041_Woman046_0443,to work through that not not restrict
Man041_Woman046_0444,you in response or trying to negate it
Man041_Woman046_0445,in some stupid way like that I think
Man041_Woman046_0446,well when we take people together I feel
Man041_Woman046_0447,like there's a reason for sure jealousy
Man041_Woman046_0448,it's not like I know this prick I so for
Man041_Woman046_0449,me like the unknown is is more difficult
Man041_Woman046_0450,than the known so if I if you talk about
Man041_Woman046_0451,a girl and she's great she's lovable ah
Man041_Woman046_0452,she's blah blah and I can be like
Man041_Woman046_0453,interesting but then when I meet her and
Man041_Woman046_0454,all becomes real I'm like I got this
Man041_Woman046_0455,shit don't because I think I'm the best
Man041_Woman046_0456,girlfriend but I have a huge sense of
Man041_Woman046_0457,fairness and what what's fair in a
Man041_Woman046_0458,relationship that's fair I why you were
Man041_Woman046_0459,acting fairly it's just but then when I
Man041_Woman046_0460,feel like because there are only are
Man041_Woman046_0461,only finite resources time so it really
Man041_Woman046_0462,just comes down to time and how we spend
Man041_Woman046_0463,our time together
Man041_Woman046_0464,and and if I feel like we're getting the
Man041_Woman046_0465,time we need together then why in the
Man041_Woman046_0466,world would I care how you spend your
Man041_Woman046_0467,time you know within safety and like I
Man041_Woman046_0468,understand good practices and don't go
Man041_Woman046_0469,out murder people in your spare time but
Man041_Woman046_0470,if we if we're doing well and we have a
Man041_Woman046_0471,good time together and we what we have
Man041_Woman046_0472,is working
Man041_Woman046_0473,very slightly at what point did you
Man041_Woman046_0474,realize you wanted to get a secondary
Man041_Woman046_0475,partner when I started you were the
Man041_Woman046_0476,first time though to be fair you were
Man041_Woman046_0477,the first time that I found a girl that
Man041_Woman046_0478,I wanted to date as much as I wanted to
Man041_Woman046_0479,date now and that was that that is I
Man041_Woman046_0480,think in a lot of ways the fantasy I
Man041_Woman046_0481,don't know if it's it never really it
Man041_Woman046_0482,doesn't say it hasn't seen to of
Man041_Woman046_0483,materialized very well but that is the
Man041_Woman046_0484,fantasy for me it's like a third ideally
Man041_Woman046_0485,the third that like both of us share but
Man041_Woman046_0486,you know at least a third that I really
Man041_Woman046_0487,care about and want and feel as much of
Man041_Woman046_0488,a connection to as you put yeah the
Man041_Woman046_0489,first time I ever like really wanted a
Man041_Woman046_0490,secondary so to speak like a meaningful
Man041_Woman046_0491,secondary was when I started dating you
Man041_Woman046_0492,now I guess before that we we certainly
Man041_Woman046_0493,had other partners yeah I believe in
Man041_Woman046_0494,this secondary bullshit no that's not I
Man041_Woman046_0495,don't think that I don't when did you
Man041_Woman046_0496,realize you wanted more than one what to
Man041_Woman046_0497,date or the one person at once
Man041_Woman046_0498,Oh with you early attempts at it weren't
Man041_Woman046_0499,I think they came from you know the last
Man041_Woman046_0500,time that I really thought about it was
Man041_Woman046_0501,when I wanted my partner and it's to get
Man041_Woman046_0502,a secondary so hopefully he would fall
Man041_Woman046_0503,in love with that secondary and leave me
Man041_Woman046_0504,Zack was too chickenshit to break up
Man041_Woman046_0505,with them oh I was I was looking for
Man041_Woman046_0506,secondaries as a way out that's fine as
Man041_Woman046_0507,well so I don't have a good it's being
Man041_Woman046_0508,bisexual and been wanting to have
Man041_Woman046_0509,relationship with a woman and there's no
Man041_Woman046_0510,way you would ever be that relationship
Man041_Woman046_0511,because you're not a woman and so there
Man041_Woman046_0512,was also just having something you you
Man041_Woman046_0513,took you take him to Vegas and then they
Man041_Woman046_0514,all fucking pissed off and leave me and
Man041_Woman046_0515,I'm like what the hell I probably
Man041_Woman046_0516,wouldn't I don't know Kate or someone
Man041_Woman046_0517,else what was her name this
Man041_Woman046_0518,twenty-something that Charlie was
Man041_Woman046_0519,waiting just probably had a Disney
Man041_Woman046_0520,Princess name knowing what kind of
Man041_Woman046_0521,family do you with everything the one so
Man041_Woman046_0522,I want to have this and then I want to
Man041_Woman046_0523,have amazing friends which we have
Man041_Woman046_0524,so I want to continue to build out our
Man041_Woman046_0525,network of friends who hopefully a
Man041_Woman046_0526,portion of will be sexy friends and that
Man041_Woman046_0527,is my philosophy on relation I would
Man041_Woman046_0528,like a bunch of awesome people with my
Man041_Woman046_0529,life
Man041_Woman046_0530,it's only because you're becoming
Man041_Woman046_0531,friends with my co-workers that you have
Man041_Woman046_0532,any significant proportion of friends
Man041_Woman046_0533,that you haven't slept with to express
Man041_Woman046_0534,myself sexually doesn't involve kids I
Man041_Woman046_0535,want to be a cool godparent or uncle
Man041_Woman046_0536,something like that but I don't want I
Man041_Woman046_0537,don't want the kids myself
Man041_Woman046_0538,I want to pets eventually can have a
Man041_Woman046_0539,farm cat those crazy dog parents or
Man041_Woman046_0540,[Music]
Man041_Woman046_0541,guardrail me Oh easy meadow are we
Man041_Woman046_0542,talking about actual dogs are you
Man041_Woman046_0543,talking about some kind of sub living
Man041_Woman046_0544,slave child I would treat them as a maid
Man041_Woman046_0545,if that's loyal slave we can keep them
Man041_Woman046_0546,in a dog cage it doesn't matter I've
Man041_Woman046_0547,kept girls in puppy cages why does this
Man041_Woman046_0548,type of structure work for you because
Man041_Woman046_0549,it forces me to constantly be thinking
Man041_Woman046_0550,about a relationship forces me to
Man041_Woman046_0551,constantly be evaluating what's true and
Man041_Woman046_0552,what's best for the two of us that's the
Man041_Woman046_0553,major Delta between this and other
Man041_Woman046_0554,relationships other thing or monogamous
Man041_Woman046_0555,relationship type thing yeah I think it
Man041_Woman046_0556,does the I constantly challenges you to
Man041_Woman046_0557,improve or at least re-examine the
Man041_Woman046_0558,contents of your relationship because
Man041_Woman046_0559,there are other relationships out
Man041_Woman046_0560,there and they're not figments
Man041_Woman046_0561,impossible there's like you can have
Man041_Woman046_0562,other real relationships out there yeah
Man041_Woman046_0563,and I think this also kind of renders
Man041_Woman046_0564,how inconsequential individual things
Man041_Woman046_0565,that you might over overweight if you
Man041_Woman046_0566,didn't have the freedom to explore goes
Man041_Woman046_0567,back to your grass is greener comment
Man041_Woman046_0568,like maybe the grass is greener in some
Man041_Woman046_0569,area like maybe you know for sake of
Man041_Woman046_0570,argument maybe your secretary is younger
Man041_Woman046_0571,or hot or whatever so you go do that
Man041_Woman046_0572,thing and then you're like ah but
Man041_Woman046_0573,they're actually really fucking boring
Man041_Woman046_0574,so you come back because there's a much
Man041_Woman046_0575,larger structure associated a whole
Man041_Woman046_0576,bunch of dimensions and so much you've
Man041_Woman046_0577,built with a partner yeah I think this
Man041_Woman046_0578,structure works for me because you I
Man041_Woman046_0579,want to be I want to have the freedom to
Man041_Woman046_0580,express my love physically and that
Man041_Woman046_0581,sounds really corny but that is really
Man041_Woman046_0582,that or even just not even my love
Man041_Woman046_0583,physically but like my lover insists
Man041_Woman046_0584,that one's a clear whatever you know
Man041_Woman046_0585,like you don't want to I don't want to
Man041_Woman046_0586,be in a sexual situation or actually you
Man041_Woman046_0587,know actually take facts out of it in a
Man041_Woman046_0588,in a platonic friendship where you feel
Man041_Woman046_0589,like I can't I can't tear for this human
Man041_Woman046_0590,being because I'm supposed to care for
Man041_Woman046_0591,this one instead sure or I can't kiss
Man041_Woman046_0592,this person cuz I'm only supposed to
Man041_Woman046_0593,kiss this person or he has sex with this
Man041_Woman046_0594,person because this other person owns my
Man041_Woman046_0595,body and all my sexual feelings and all
Man041_Woman046_0596,of my all of all the things I like and
Man041_Woman046_0597,respect about other hey maybe even that
Man041_Woman046_0598,is just fucking crazy to think that you
Man041_Woman046_0599,can own someone's body and mind and
Man041_Woman046_0600,spirit it's ridiculous absolutely
Man041_Woman046_0601,ridiculous to me I agree with you it's
Man041_Woman046_0602,okay
Man041_Woman046_0603,[Laughter]
Man041_Woman046_0604,and I think I think the idea of strict
Man041_Woman046_0605,monogamy is actually a newer idea sure I
Man041_Woman046_0606,think that we as humans have not been
Man041_Woman046_0607,strictly monogamous for nearly as long
Man041_Woman046_0608,as we think you know
Man041_Woman046_0609,you're hitting a topic that we dislike
Man041_Woman046_0610,it's hard to have a deep conversation is
Man041_Woman046_0611,really just women getting the permission
Man041_Woman046_0612,to have more than one relationship
Man041_Woman046_0613,because men had that permission for
Man041_Woman046_0614,thousands of years up until a certain
Man041_Woman046_0615,point at which point women were suddenly
Man041_Woman046_0616,encouraged to fight back yeah and then
Man041_Woman046_0617,and now this is the return of feminism
Man041_Woman046_0618,in his now relationship I hope I hope
Man041_Woman046_0619,it's I'm like whatever you want to call
Man041_Woman046_0620,it a five-year commitment ceremony or
Man041_Woman046_0621,what not it we have one like our like
Man041_Woman046_0622,our friends who have had one in which
Man041_Woman046_0623,they just are having a party with all
Man041_Woman046_0624,they're all there's like friends all
Man041_Woman046_0625,their sexy friends I like I hope that
Man041_Woman046_0626,there is an after party thank you
Man041_Woman046_0627,how is sex different with your other
Man041_Woman046_0628,partners than it is with me or any more
Man041_Woman046_0629,hesitant and more complicated and
Man041_Woman046_0630,there's a lot more second-guessing and I
Man041_Woman046_0631,have to give a lot more feedback and I
Man041_Woman046_0632,can't just be like you don't try it's
Man041_Woman046_0633,like you just don't have that really
Man041_Woman046_0634,really honest honest relationship try
Man041_Woman046_0635,like you would just move 5 centimeters
Man041_Woman046_0636,to the left to bossy or make them feel
Man041_Woman046_0637,like they're doing a bad job interesting
Man041_Woman046_0638,I would have said I would have taken a
Man041_Woman046_0639,I mean I agree with the thing you said
Man041_Woman046_0640,that sex with other people is more
Man041_Woman046_0641,awkward I would also have said that like
Man041_Woman046_0642,I think there's just literal things that
Man041_Woman046_0643,I do with other partners that I don't do
Man041_Woman046_0644,with you some some of which probably
Man041_Woman046_0645,just cuz I haven't explored up with you
Man041_Woman046_0646,some of which goes there into specific
Man041_Woman046_0647,things but that it like that's the way
Man041_Woman046_0648,sex is really different there's
Man041_Woman046_0649,literally just different acts that get
Man041_Woman046_0650,done in different places you watched a
Man041_Woman046_0651,guy massage me and you're like oh you
Man041_Woman046_0652,like to be massaged like yes how did we
Man041_Woman046_0653,not have this conversation the first two
Man041_Woman046_0654,years of our relationship and then bone
Man041_Woman046_0655,it just works out perfectly for me this
Man041_Woman046_0656,is like and I think there's people up to
Man041_Woman046_0657,a completely different style or they're
Man041_Woman046_0658,do they're into something different and
Man041_Woman046_0659,and you try that and you're like I think
Man041_Woman046_0660,you get into a rut when you don't have
Man041_Woman046_0661,outside input and outside ideas whether
Man041_Woman046_0662,that idea is like I saw someone do
Man041_Woman046_0663,something or about something but I think
Man041_Woman046_0664,it gets stale really quickly
Man041_Woman046_0665,you
Man041_Woman046_0666,what you get from other partners that
Man041_Woman046_0667,you don't get from me specifically with
Man041_Woman046_0668,Amanda I think that there is a degree of
Man041_Woman046_0669,like ridiculous you ready what do you
Man041_Woman046_0670,get from other partners that you don't
Man041_Woman046_0671,get from me
Man041_Woman046_0672,the one thing I can think of is with
Man041_Woman046_0673,Amanda I get a ridiculous amount of just
Man041_Woman046_0674,like she wants me in like I don't get me
Man041_Woman046_0675,wrong like you want me and and hers is
Man041_Woman046_0676,just this ridiculously like she doesn't
Man041_Woman046_0677,understand she hasn't dealt with it with
Man041_Woman046_0678,any other people so this unrestrained
Man041_Woman046_0679,unquenchable I don't know
Man041_Woman046_0680,thing and then that's that that like to
Man041_Woman046_0681,the point where it causes her to ignore
Man041_Woman046_0682,the like core things about the way she
Man041_Woman046_0683,lived you know to pursue that that's the
Man041_Woman046_0684,only thing there's like a degree of
Man041_Woman046_0685,validation I think you know to go so far
Man041_Woman046_0686,in your life saying no no no and to be
Man041_Woman046_0687,the guy got her to say yes it's pretty
Man041_Woman046_0688,awesome I thought you were gonna say
Man041_Woman046_0689,that you don't get the pain play alright
Man041_Woman046_0690,there's that thing but I think we've
Man041_Woman046_0691,already been over that thing repeatedly
Man041_Woman046_0692,at the end of the day I think if I
Man041_Woman046_0693,really wanted you to do it you would you
Man041_Woman046_0694,would at least acquiesce to some extent
Man041_Woman046_0695,to me now but that's the the thing I'm
Man041_Woman046_0696,trying to describe
Man041_Woman046_0697,is the thing outside the sex I think
Man041_Woman046_0698,yeah yeah no I think that is maybe
Man041_Woman046_0699,that's why I like watching you guys fuck
Man041_Woman046_0700,because it is like super hot and
Man041_Woman046_0701,passionate she's wild untamed like give
Man041_Woman046_0702,this girl two drinks I kind of see what
Man041_Woman046_0703,happened she would have gotten all
Man041_Woman046_0704,flustered so I think well when I'm
Man041_Woman046_0705,dating a girl I get a vagina which I
Man041_Woman046_0706,don't get from you right in a way I
Man041_Woman046_0707,don't know how that is
Man041_Woman046_0708,I think I just get a different
Man041_Woman046_0709,perspective on things and in her
Man041_Woman046_0710,backstory and sometimes a different
Man041_Woman046_0711,skillset and then different passions
Man041_Woman046_0712,true there's nothing like consistent
Man041_Woman046_0713,then I go around looking for well yeah I
Man041_Woman046_0714,think it's gonna vary person to person
Man041_Woman046_0715,like there's no like oh I know exactly
Man041_Woman046_0716,what I'm gonna get from other people
Man041_Woman046_0717,that I'm not gonna get you guys
Man041_Woman046_0718,I mean aside from a novelty like
Man041_Woman046_0719,obviously every new person has novelty
Man041_Woman046_0720,associated with them for some period of
Man041_Woman046_0721,time
Man041_Woman046_0722,[Laughter]
Man041_Woman046_0723,seriously though because we're thank you
Man041_Woman046_0724,that's the real answer cuz I wanna I
Man041_Woman046_0725,want to dink I don't
Man041_Woman046_0726,kids don't make you happier but every
Man041_Woman046_0727,parent will tell you they do yeah I do
Man041_Woman046_0728,feel obligated to help the next
Man041_Woman046_0729,generation in some way so I'm gonna
Man041_Woman046_0730,that's why I want to be an awesome God
Man041_Woman046_0731,basher yeah like mentor I was mentoring
Man041_Woman046_0732,college kids at school so we don't end
Man041_Woman046_0733,up in a world like it yeah Chrissy I
Man041_Woman046_0734,don't think it's necessarily in range of
Man041_Woman046_0735,that thing so I plan on being with you
Man041_Woman046_0736,for as long as man ik so that's not my
Man041_Woman046_0737,answer right there that I recognize that
Man041_Woman046_0738,I really give you the truth yeah no I
Man041_Woman046_0739,really should and and you know when I
Man041_Woman046_0740,hate I think the bar for romanticism is
Man041_Woman046_0741,so high and that I'm supposed to say to
Man041_Woman046_0742,you like I love you more than life
Man041_Woman046_0743,itself
Man041_Woman046_0744,I'd die for you and we're gonna be
Man041_Woman046_0745,together until one of us is dead and
Man041_Woman046_0746,that's supposed to be super hot I would
Man041_Woman046_0747,rather say you're the most important
Man041_Woman046_0748,person in my life and there's nothing I
Man041_Woman046_0749,can imagine in the future changing that
Man041_Woman046_0750,so we're so pragmatic
Man041_Woman046_0751,I just think that you're using right I
Man041_Woman046_0752,just think that there's a I mean there's
Man041_Woman046_0753,a reality and the reality is for some
Man041_Woman046_0754,period of time which might be a year or
Man041_Woman046_0755,a hundred years or a thousand or
Man041_Woman046_0756,whatever
Man041_Woman046_0757,sciences technology expander lives to be
Man041_Woman046_0758,we're gonna be good for each other
Man041_Woman046_0759,and as long as as long as that's true
Man041_Woman046_0760,I'd want to stay together like and I
Man041_Woman046_0761,imagine even the way we stay together
Man041_Woman046_0762,good shit
Man041_Woman046_0763,over time it could mutate but that
Man041_Woman046_0764,doesn't change the fact that as long as
Man041_Woman046_0765,there's something good here I'd want
Man041_Woman046_0766,that to be true
Man041_Woman046_0767,I'd want this to be no if I could just
Man041_Woman046_0768,stop worrying about unknown really just
Man041_Woman046_0769,say you know here we are 18 and I know
Man041_Woman046_0770,exactly who I am and will always be and
Man041_Woman046_0771,I want you to be exactly who you are and
Man041_Woman046_0772,like the couples we don't grow together
Man041_Woman046_0773,they don't change together and then all
Man041_Woman046_0774,of a sudden they get to 27 and they're
Man041_Woman046_0775,like oh my god you know we have to get a
Man041_Woman046_0776,divorce it's not working and it's like
Man041_Woman046_0777,well duh oh you who you wanted to be
Man041_Woman046_0778,with at 18 is may be completely
Man041_Woman046_0779,different from who you want to be with a
Man041_Woman046_0780,27 I'm just glad that we got our
Man041_Woman046_0781,practice relationships before meeting
Man041_Woman046_0782,each other that's practiced well and
Man041_Woman046_0783,accept that everything everything
Man041_Woman046_0784,do you want to ask me anything
Man041_Woman046_0785,plus one thing we can do - what's one
Man041_Woman046_0786,thing we can do that would make our
Man041_Woman046_0787,relationship better get more vacation
Man041_Woman046_0788,time in our next contract negotiation I
Man041_Woman046_0789,think I have to get back on track about
Man041_Woman046_0790,getting us out of town once a weekend
Man041_Woman046_0791,the guest stars work out how we work
Man041_Woman046_0792,with a guest star if boi unicorns exist
Man041_Woman046_0793,not a boy unicorn I think I have to get
Man041_Woman046_0794,unstuck career-wise so that we can plan
Man041_Woman046_0795,the next couple of years what are your
Man041_Woman046_0796,parents think of our relationship my
Man041_Woman046_0797,parents relationship they're really
Man041_Woman046_0798,happy that I'm happy they think you're
Man041_Woman046_0799,really sweet I think that there's a to
Man041_Woman046_0800,be honest I don't really know my dad
Man041_Woman046_0801,things because it's about as he's opaque
Man041_Woman046_0802,to me in many ways and it's only as a
Man041_Woman046_0803,result of mom telling me what he thinks
Man041_Woman046_0804,that I ever learned but I think that I
Man041_Woman046_0805,think that they in some ways probably
Man041_Woman046_0806,struggle in the sense that it's
Man041_Woman046_0807,non-traditional and thus they're not as
Man041_Woman046_0808,familiar / able to process it the same
Man041_Woman046_0809,way but I think mostly my parents are
Man041_Woman046_0810,like really happy
Man041_Woman046_0811,and I found someone that I cared about
Man041_Woman046_0812,who obviously cares about me
Man041_Woman046_0813,I have no idea what your parents think
Man041_Woman046_0814,of me they like you they like you a lot
Man041_Woman046_0815,actually my grandmother loves ya well
Man041_Woman046_0816,yeah I think I made I think I made a
Man041_Woman046_0817,super good impression grandparents but
Man041_Woman046_0818,your Corinth I can't tell I don't know
Man041_Woman046_0819,you well enough to make any sort of
Man041_Woman046_0820,really I mean I think they're like your
Man041_Woman046_0821,parents so they're like I like that you
Man041_Woman046_0822,like her I don't know you very well I've
Man041_Woman046_0823,spent a couple hours with you that you
Man041_Woman046_0824,seem alright and you're a lot less crazy
Man041_Woman046_0825,than my last boyfriend so that's good if
Man041_Woman046_0826,I hit that point where I start getting
Man041_Woman046_0827,that's crazy as Benny you should tell me
Man041_Woman046_0828,that we should talk about that far
Man041_Woman046_0829,before I hit maybe try and fix the
Man041_Woman046_0830,problem as opposed to letting me slide
Man041_Woman046_0831,in the madness I'm not saying it's your
Man041_Woman046_0832,fault
