Woman031_Woman032_0005,funny because this is a nice memory but
Woman031_Woman032_0006,I don't really remember it that well but
Woman031_Woman032_0007,there's like bits of it that I remember
Woman031_Woman032_0008,going to the Bronx Zoo I think and
Woman031_Woman032_0009,getting froggy dough wasn't at the Bronx

Woman031_Woman032_0013,bunch of big frogs on the like up on the
Woman031_Woman032_0014,shelves I think that's right yeah that's
Woman031_Woman032_0015,such a hard question like like how can I
Woman031_Woman032_0016,choose one memory so probably that just
Woman031_Woman032_0017,because I don't remember it that well
Woman031_Woman032_0018,and I love froggy Doo that's fine
Woman031_Woman032_0019,that'll work actually what's your
Woman031_Woman032_0020,favorite childhood memory my favorite
Woman031_Woman032_0021,childhood memory and why my childhood
Woman031_Woman032_0022,your childhood of your child
Woman031_Woman032_0023,mm probably I remember like coming to
Woman031_Woman032_0024,the stairs and seeing a whole bunch of
Woman031_Woman032_0025,foil covered chocolate bunnies for
Woman031_Woman032_0026,Easter and I just felt like so rich and
Woman031_Woman032_0027,abundant like the it just felt like this

Woman031_Woman032_0029,feeling of like oh yes I have so much
Woman031_Woman032_0030,and somebody loves me so much that I
Woman031_Woman032_0031,have all these chocolate Easter bunnies
Woman031_Woman032_0032,and then later on I found out they
Woman031_Woman032_0033,weren't even for my parents yeah but
Woman031_Woman032_0034,that's one of them oh and actually
Woman031_Woman032_0035,something that I always go back to the
Woman031_Woman032_0036,the hill going around in Germany around
Woman031_Woman032_0037,the corner up the hill and just making
Woman031_Woman032_0038,daisy chains it was like so relaxing I
Woman031_Woman032_0039,that's one of my happy places that I go
Woman031_Woman032_0040,to when I want to relax okay
Woman031_Woman032_0041,wait do us one now then since I know
Woman031_Woman032_0042,what are your fondest memories with me I
Woman031_Woman032_0043,remember like when when we were sleeping
Woman031_Woman032_0044,like next to each other and just looking
Woman031_Woman032_0045,into each other's eyes and you would
Woman031_Woman032_0046,like smile and and it was just like cozy
Woman031_Woman032_0047,and in 157 or anywhere it's like I
Woman031_Woman032_0048,wasn't aware where we were it was just
Woman031_Woman032_0049,remembering that you were there and it
Woman031_Woman032_0050,was like a nice feeling it was like I'm
Woman031_Woman032_0051,not alone in the world like that what's
Woman031_Woman032_0052,the greatest lesson I taught you
Woman031_Woman032_0053,well I think their lesson is that you
Woman031_Woman032_0054,weren't like hey look know this about
Woman031_Woman032_0055,life it was just like from growing up I
Woman031_Woman032_0056,think being like strong and independent
Woman031_Woman032_0057,and just like I don't know I feel like I
Woman031_Woman032_0058,have like a adventurous and like strong
Woman031_Woman032_0059,personality because like I just
Woman031_Woman032_0060,witnessed that and you so it's and I
Woman031_Woman032_0061,like that that's something I learned
Woman031_Woman032_0062,from you without it being like oh you
Woman031_Woman032_0063,should know this about life you know it
Woman031_Woman032_0064,was like you never told me that it's
Woman031_Woman032_0065,just like you were just being yourself
Woman031_Woman032_0066,and through that and I really get out
Woman031_Woman032_0067,saving money to really good with money
Woman031_Woman032_0068,sixty okay yeah what do you think are my
Woman031_Woman032_0069,best qualities as a mother oh it was
Woman031_Woman032_0070,your takeover okay when were you
Woman031_Woman032_0071,proudest of me and why one particular
Woman031_Woman032_0072,thing
Woman031_Woman032_0073,[Music]
Woman031_Woman032_0074,just it's not like a moment or anything
Woman031_Woman032_0075,like I just seeing you grow into an
Woman031_Woman032_0076,adult like I remember when you were even
Woman031_Woman032_0077,a teenager and reading things at your
Woman031_Woman032_0078,Road and it was like always having to
Woman031_Woman032_0079,correct so much and like ah don't you
Woman031_Woman032_0080,understand
Woman031_Woman032_0081,you know and then now like I'll read
Woman031_Woman032_0082,things at you right it's like hey this
Woman031_Woman032_0083,is like she's a person and it's like
Woman031_Woman032_0084,it's like a I feel proud that you are
Woman031_Woman032_0085,perfect that sounds crazy but it's like
Woman031_Woman032_0086,this weird thing cuz you're like this
Woman031_Woman032_0087,little and then it you know just yeah I
Woman031_Woman032_0088,mean I'm proud of you you're like a good
Woman031_Woman032_0089,person think there's like a lot of
Woman031_Woman032_0090,things that are part of you for and yeah
Woman031_Woman032_0091,okay so what do you think are my best
Woman031_Woman032_0092,qualities as a mother best qualities as
Woman031_Woman032_0093,a mother
Woman031_Woman032_0094,[Laughter]
Woman031_Woman032_0095,okay you're all ready I won't look at
Woman031_Woman032_0096,you no you can look at me those
Woman031_Woman032_0097,qualities as a mother I mean I think it
Woman031_Woman032_0098,goes back to what I said like what
Woman031_Woman032_0099,you've taught me I think that you you
Woman031_Woman032_0100,know you were a mother by yourself
Woman031_Woman032_0101,that's like I don't you know I can't
Woman031_Woman032_0102,like choose one thing there were like
Woman031_Woman032_0103,good things and bad things about you
Woman031_Woman032_0104,being a mother but like you did it I
Woman031_Woman032_0105,think that's the best thing you know you
Woman031_Woman032_0106,you were young and you decided to be a
Woman031_Woman032_0107,mother and do the best you could and you
Woman031_Woman032_0108,know I never felt neglected of love
Woman031_Woman032_0109,which is pretty good for someone who's
Woman031_Woman032_0110,doing it by themselves you know there's
Woman031_Woman032_0111,moments works like Oh like you know are
Woman031_Woman032_0112,Oh have you hugged you're like you know
Woman031_Woman032_0113,you're not that affectionate but like I
Woman031_Woman032_0114,never felt like you didn't love me ever
Woman031_Woman032_0115,yeah I think that's that's something
Woman031_Woman032_0116,that I it's funny and like now that I'm
Woman031_Woman032_0117,the age I am I am like lately I've been
Woman031_Woman032_0118,thinking about the fact that like you
Woman031_Woman032_0119,were this age and you had kids like
Woman031_Woman032_0120,that's crazy to me like I can't imagine
Woman031_Woman032_0121,that's crazy to me so I think that you
Woman031_Woman032_0122,just like kept going you know
Woman031_Woman032_0123,what do you most admire about me you
Woman031_Woman032_0124,have an optimistic outlook you
Woman031_Woman032_0125,appreciate things that can be come you
Woman031_Woman032_0126,could choose to see it as a negative but
Woman031_Woman032_0127,you're mature enough now to be able to
Woman031_Woman032_0128,see the positive in it for example the
Woman031_Woman032_0129,fact that you're paying for your own
Woman031_Woman032_0130,college and technically I could pay for
Woman031_Woman032_0131,it what I choose not to and the fact
Woman031_Woman032_0132,that instead of being a jerk about it
Woman031_Woman032_0133,and being like what was me you're like
Woman031_Woman032_0134,you know what this is good because it's
Woman031_Woman032_0135,teaching me independence I'm doing
Woman031_Woman032_0136,really well because I'm doing it myself
Woman031_Woman032_0137,and you're seeing the lesson in it
Woman031_Woman032_0138,instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Woman031_Woman032_0139,and that says a lot you know you're not
Woman031_Woman032_0140,pitying yourself you're like what could
Woman031_Woman032_0141,I get out of this and and you see what
Woman031_Woman032_0142,I'm trying to say and you I feel like
Woman031_Woman032_0143,sometimes you can understand where I'm
Woman031_Woman032_0144,coming from
Woman031_Woman032_0145,and you know what advice would you give
Woman031_Woman032_0146,me to being a better mother
Woman031_Woman032_0147,hmm maybe I think advice I'd give you is
Woman031_Woman032_0148,just like well we've talked about like
Woman031_Woman032_0149,and it sucks because I kind of overheard
Woman031_Woman032_0150,you into a little bit but not on this
Woman031_Woman032_0151,question or anything but just that
Woman031_Woman032_0152,concept of like the whole like comparing
Woman031_Woman032_0153,thing like the wanting or feeling like
Woman031_Woman032_0154,you didn't get certain things in life so
Woman031_Woman032_0155,you like feel a type of way about like
Woman031_Woman032_0156,what you give us I guess I'm not trying
Woman031_Woman032_0157,to explain it but I advise I maybe be be
Woman031_Woman032_0158,proud of yourself more and give yourself
Woman031_Woman032_0159,more credit because I think that in
Woman031_Woman032_0160,areas where where it seems like you're
Woman031_Woman032_0161,like oh I didn't get this so why should
Woman031_Woman032_0162,they get that you know that whole thing
Woman031_Woman032_0163,I think that comes from like not
Woman031_Woman032_0164,recognizing like pitying yourself for
Woman031_Woman032_0165,your situation rather than recognizing
Woman031_Woman032_0166,how like well you're doing in your
Woman031_Woman032_0167,situation so probably also being a
Woman031_Woman032_0168,little bit more positive when it comes
Woman031_Woman032_0169,to and a little bit more confident
Woman031_Woman032_0170,because that rubs off on other people I
Woman031_Woman032_0171,think that there's areas where it's like
Woman031_Woman032_0172,yeah of course everyone's insecure about
Woman031_Woman032_0173,certain things and it's hard to be alone
Woman031_Woman032_0174,and like have all these feelings and not
Woman031_Woman032_0175,have someone supporting you and like
Woman031_Woman032_0176,making you feel like you know not having
Woman031_Woman032_0177,a partner like oh you're a great mom you
Woman031_Woman032_0178,know it's like you know what I mean I
Woman031_Woman032_0179,mean it's true it's like I think that
Woman031_Woman032_0180,you just need to have more of an
Woman031_Woman032_0181,awareness of how
Woman031_Woman032_0182,like love you are and how you know well
Woman031_Woman032_0183,you've done and then that will just
Woman031_Woman032_0184,spread out to your children and other
Woman031_Woman032_0185,people you know what I mean so it's like
Woman031_Woman032_0186,I guess being a little bit more positive
Woman031_Woman032_0187,I guess that's my advice
Woman031_Woman032_0188,yeah that's a hard question they're all
Woman031_Woman032_0189,hard what moment or moments do you feel
Woman031_Woman032_0190,I let you down and how do you feel about
Woman031_Woman032_0191,it now what it's my turn oh oh I took
Woman031_Woman032_0192,your turn again I'm sorry I don't even
Woman031_Woman032_0193,know if I did that was when or what was
Woman031_Woman032_0194,the toughest moment and our relationship
Woman031_Woman032_0195,and how do you feel about it when you
Woman031_Woman032_0196,were a teenager and you were out of
Woman031_Woman032_0197,control and you were like screaming at
Woman031_Woman032_0198,me and being disrespectful they even
Woman031_Woman032_0199,said I hate you or something I think you
Woman031_Woman032_0200,said that I was like what how does that
Woman031_Woman032_0201,even come out of your mouth and just I
Woman031_Woman032_0202,was flabbergasted yeah how do you feel
Woman031_Woman032_0203,about it now oh I feel like oh you know
Woman031_Woman032_0204,what that was just a face she went
Woman031_Woman032_0205,through and thankfully she's matured
Woman031_Woman032_0206,since then and that was like just this
Woman031_Woman032_0207,thing it's not like part of who you are
Woman031_Woman032_0208,you just went through something and
Woman031_Woman032_0209,you've grown you've matured and you
Woman031_Woman032_0210,don't do that stuff anymore and I'm very
Woman031_Woman032_0211,glad about that yeah it's really cool
Woman031_Woman032_0212,it's just in a few years so you changed
Woman031_Woman032_0213,just in a few years like a lot
Woman031_Woman032_0214,now what moment or moments do you feel I
Woman031_Woman032_0215,let you down and how do you feel about
Woman031_Woman032_0216,it now
Woman031_Woman032_0217,I don't know I think like you compared
Woman031_Woman032_0218,me to tie a lot and I don't know I think
Woman031_Woman032_0219,that you were like you were a little bit
Woman031_Woman032_0220,too hard on the grounding stuff yeah I
Woman031_Woman032_0221,feel like tie was bad and then you were
Woman031_Woman032_0222,like preparing yourself for like let me
Woman031_Woman032_0223,make sure this kid isn't bad you know
Woman031_Woman032_0224,yeah I feel like you like expected me to
Woman031_Woman032_0225,be bad and sure I was bad on my own I'm
Woman031_Woman032_0226,not believing you for me being bad but
Woman031_Woman032_0227,like there was a lot of instances where
Woman031_Woman032_0228,you made me feel like a really bad kid
Woman031_Woman032_0229,before I like you've got a chance to be
Woman031_Woman032_0230,one yeah
Woman031_Woman032_0231,and how do you feel about now oh I don't
Woman031_Woman032_0232,fully understand but I'm like able to
Woman031_Woman032_0233,recognize that it's hard to you know
Woman031_Woman032_0234,parent someone and like hard to know how
Woman031_Woman032_0235,to you know make sure that they're you
Woman031_Woman032_0236,do the right thing and do the wrong
Woman031_Woman032_0237,thing so in it I was just like you know
Woman031_Woman032_0238,I felt however I felt I felt hurt or
Woman031_Woman032_0239,didn't understand but I'm sure no you're
Woman031_Woman032_0240,just trying to make sure that your kid
Woman031_Woman032_0241,is good and then there's no rulebook
Woman031_Woman032_0242,yes were you here for this oh I mean we
Woman031_Woman032_0243,say this all the time you know yeah it's
Woman031_Woman032_0244,like there's no right way like you could
Woman031_Woman032_0245,have done you could have done that or
Woman031_Woman032_0246,you you could have done something
Woman031_Woman032_0247,differently and you know it's like the
Woman031_Woman032_0248,achieve result is this what do I do to
Woman031_Woman032_0249,get that click click click click
Woman031_Woman032_0250,yeah if only my turn Oh
Woman031_Woman032_0251,what are you hesitant to tell me I mean
Woman031_Woman032_0252,I might have already told you this but I
Woman031_Woman032_0253,don't trust Nico oh yeah like I don't
Woman031_Woman032_0254,want you to have negative feelings for
Woman031_Woman032_0255,me about my feelings for Nico but I
Woman031_Woman032_0256,don't trust him I think he's very
Woman031_Woman032_0257,selfish and even though like whenever he
Woman031_Woman032_0258,shows his vulnerable side my heart goes
Woman031_Woman032_0259,out to him but I don't trust him I don't
Woman031_Woman032_0260,like him in my house what yeah are you
Woman031_Woman032_0261,serious I mean that sucks
Woman031_Woman032_0262,not without preparing me not without
Woman031_Woman032_0263,like the way you keep like you know oh
Woman031_Woman032_0264,by the way we're over here or something
Woman031_Woman032_0265,like that like drives me nuts you know
Woman031_Woman032_0266,and I like it limited to just a little
Woman031_Woman032_0267,bit here and there I wonder if it's Nico
Woman031_Woman032_0268,or just people like I feel like you're
Woman031_Woman032_0269,just not very open with your home you
Woman031_Woman032_0270,know I mean I'm not cuz it's messy but
Woman031_Woman032_0271,also I don't trust him yeah it's like
Woman031_Woman032_0272,he's sure hey I've seen evidence of that
Woman031_Woman032_0273,he's out for himself
Woman031_Woman032_0274,and he puts himself in front of
Woman031_Woman032_0275,everybody he puts himself first always
Woman031_Woman032_0276,like he doesn't strike me as someone who
Woman031_Woman032_0277,really cares about anyone but himself
Woman031_Woman032_0278,oh yeah I mean honestly that's just oh
Woman031_Woman032_0279,and I know I feel bad telling you this
Woman031_Woman032_0280,because like I don't want you to I know
Woman031_Woman032_0281,you got mad at me before because I said
Woman031_Woman032_0282,something about him and like your
Woman031_Woman032_0283,feelings for him and that I thought you
Woman031_Woman032_0284,were weak from being with him all the
Woman031_Woman032_0285,time which you know I'm glad you're
Woman031_Woman032_0286,stronger an hour and everything like
Woman031_Woman032_0287,that but yeah anyway I don't hate him
Woman031_Woman032_0288,okay even though you already told me
Woman031_Woman032_0289,that
Woman031_Woman032_0290,I was like did I tell you or now that
Woman031_Woman032_0291,you know sometimes it's like something
Woman031_Woman032_0292,on your mind and you're like skipping
Woman031_Woman032_0293,you like don't want to tell someone then
Woman031_Woman032_0294,and then you tell them anyway and then
Woman031_Woman032_0295,you still you forgot that you told them
Woman031_Woman032_0296,because you like yeah okay I cannot get
Woman031_Woman032_0297,it straight
Woman031_Woman032_0298,what does a mistake you see me make
Woman031_Woman032_0299,repeatedly why do you think I keep
Woman031_Woman032_0300,making it what is a mistake I think you
Woman031_Woman032_0301,make repeatedly like in general or in
Woman031_Woman032_0302,life were with kids like I we've talked
Woman031_Woman032_0303,about this before and I stand by it this
Woman031_Woman032_0304,concept that you have not even the
Woman031_Woman032_0305,concept just like the way you go about
Woman031_Woman032_0306,it that whole like the world owes me
Woman031_Woman032_0307,something like yes absolutely the world
Woman031_Woman032_0308,owes everyone something you know I think
Woman031_Woman032_0309,it's the attitude behind it like no it's
Woman031_Woman032_0310,it seems weird it's weird to me because
Woman031_Woman032_0311,like you know I know you're a good
Woman031_Woman032_0312,person but it makes you seem like a bad
Woman031_Woman032_0313,person when you say that like it makes
Woman031_Woman032_0314,you seem when you say that too ugly to
Woman031_Woman032_0315,me
Woman031_Woman032_0316,and I think having that attitude having
Woman031_Woman032_0317,that attitude like they're I don't know
Woman031_Woman032_0318,I it's not you're not gonna get what you
Woman031_Woman032_0319,want if you're sitting around like the
Woman031_Woman032_0320,world owes me something you know it's
Woman031_Woman032_0321,just I think that that can hold you back
Woman031_Woman032_0322,and do I like to say it the way so you
Woman031_Woman032_0323,don't say it a lot you don't but I mean
Woman031_Woman032_0324,your did you say it to me because it's
Woman031_Woman032_0325,moments where you're just like no
Woman031_Woman032_0326,confiding but you understand why no I
Woman031_Woman032_0327,absolutely understand why you and I
Woman031_Woman032_0328,don't and if I had it and I think some
Woman031_Woman032_0329,people should feel that way and I feel
Woman031_Woman032_0330,like some people have a right to feel
Woman031_Woman032_0331,that way and some people don't have a
Woman031_Woman032_0332,right to feel that way
Woman031_Woman032_0333,you know like in in the world there's
Woman031_Woman032_0334,it's the balance you know and some
Woman031_Woman032_0335,people have like a lot of bad stuff and
Woman031_Woman032_0336,very little good stuff and vice-versa or
Woman031_Woman032_0337,whatever and and I always try to balance
Woman031_Woman032_0338,it out it's like my mission in life
Woman031_Woman032_0339,whenever I see somebody who has like I
Woman031_Woman032_0340,would never help someone who's in a
Woman031_Woman032_0341,better position than me like yeah I try
Woman031_Woman032_0342,not to like anyone who has more money
Woman031_Woman032_0343,than me and they're younger than me and
Woman031_Woman032_0344,they ask me how for something you just
Woman031_Woman032_0345,have a very like I understand your
Woman031_Woman032_0346,concepts of the world but it's like so
Woman031_Woman032_0347,weird and OCD it's like yeah I've been
Woman031_Woman032_0348,like I get everything I get what you're
Woman031_Woman032_0349,saying but like I don't know it's just
Woman031_Woman032_0350,like the way you think about it it's
Woman031_Woman032_0351,like it's weird I don't know I think
Woman031_Woman032_0352,what I think what it is is I think that
Woman031_Woman032_0353,you should just like you know accept
Woman031_Woman032_0354,what's going on and you should think
Woman031_Woman032_0355,that like you know you should want
Woman031_Woman032_0356,things and what things for yourself but
Woman031_Woman032_0357,like just that I don't know there's
Woman031_Woman032_0358,something about like the world owes me
Woman031_Woman032_0359,it's just it's just strange to me and I
Woman031_Woman032_0360,think it's just a weird way to put it
Woman031_Woman032_0361,it's it seems selfish and you have a
Woman031_Woman032_0362,right to be selfish because you you know
Woman031_Woman032_0363,you've not had that much of an
Woman031_Woman032_0364,opportunity to live your own life
Woman031_Woman032_0365,you know but I think in some situations
Woman031_Woman032_0366,it holds you back like socially you know
Woman031_Woman032_0367,just having that yeah it does now
Woman031_Woman032_0368,live your life and stop thinking about
Woman031_Woman032_0369,it so much just let it come don't be
Woman031_Woman032_0370,like once my stuff gonna come this week
Woman031_Woman032_0371,yeah okay okay what's the hardest thing
Woman031_Woman032_0372,about being the mom oh I'm gonna use my
Woman031_Woman032_0373,safe answer not knowing what to do not
Woman031_Woman032_0374,not knowing what words to say what
Woman031_Woman032_0375,actions to take in order to achieve the
Woman031_Woman032_0376,desired results that's the hardest thing
Woman031_Woman032_0377,and also like knowing that no matter
Woman031_Woman032_0378,what you do it could be wrong no matter
Woman031_Woman032_0379,what you do your kids could end up like
Woman031_Woman032_0380,having bad feelings about you and no
Woman031_Woman032_0381,matter you could be like having the best
Woman031_Woman032_0382,intentions and then you do it this way
Woman031_Woman032_0383,or that way or the other way or the
Woman031_Woman032_0384,opposite way and no matter which way you
Woman031_Woman032_0385,do it they're gonna end up mad and
Woman031_Woman032_0386,having bad thoughts about you and stuff
Woman031_Woman032_0387,or other people will and and bad things
Woman031_Woman032_0388,are gonna happen no matter what
Woman031_Woman032_0389,that that I mean I'm not saying always
Woman031_Woman032_0390,bad things but I'm just saying that's
Woman031_Woman032_0391,the hard part like being afraid of the
Woman031_Woman032_0392,consequences of every single decision
Woman031_Woman032_0393,that you make and it's like this is your
Woman031_Woman032_0394,making decision making that's it making
Woman031_Woman032_0395,choices like deciding what should I do
Woman031_Woman032_0396,that
Woman031_Woman032_0397,it's really hard right mm-hmm
Woman031_Woman032_0398,what's the pain in me you'd like to heal
Woman031_Woman032_0399,just like
Woman031_Woman032_0400,I think the fact that you feel like
Woman031_Woman032_0401,alone you know I've always I mean I
Woman031_Woman032_0402,don't know if I told you this and I feel
Woman031_Woman032_0403,bad but one day I went to the basement
Woman031_Woman032_0404,and I like opened one of the books and I
Woman031_Woman032_0405,read a little bit it was just like you
Woman031_Woman032_0406,know you felt trapped having kids and I
Woman031_Woman032_0407,don't know it's it's weird and I'm glad
Woman031_Woman032_0408,you had us and stuff but sometimes I
Woman031_Woman032_0409,feel bad I feel like you know you didn't
Woman031_Woman032_0410,get to like you know live as much as you
Woman031_Woman032_0411,could have were like you know we're held
Woman031_Woman032_0412,back by having kids in some ways and I
Woman031_Woman032_0413,don't know I've always like felt this
Woman031_Woman032_0414,like I wish I could just like brick put
Woman031_Woman032_0415,love into my mom to life like and yeah I
Woman031_Woman032_0416,mean I can give you love and stuff like
Woman031_Woman032_0417,that but like having like I guess a
Woman031_Woman032_0418,significant other like that's always
Woman031_Woman032_0419,really bothered me because it's like you
Woman031_Woman032_0420,know why is my mom alone like you know
Woman031_Woman032_0421,and it's like there's nothing wrong with
Woman031_Woman032_0422,you so that's not the problem and that's
Woman031_Woman032_0423,why I feel like the problem is you don't
Woman031_Woman032_0424,even have time to go out and find that
Woman031_Woman032_0425,because you're just like here you know
Woman031_Woman032_0426,being a mom all the time so that I you
Woman031_Woman032_0427,know that's not something I can heal I
Woman031_Woman032_0428,mean the only thing I can do is like
Woman031_Woman032_0429,give my love and appreciation but it's
Woman031_Woman032_0430,still like I don't know yeah that's
Woman031_Woman032_0431,something that you have to go out and
Woman031_Woman032_0432,find yourself and I guess the only way I
Woman031_Woman032_0433,can like heal that is by being
Woman031_Woman032_0434,supportive like just as like a person to
Woman031_Woman032_0435,person and like I think like helping you
Woman031_Woman032_0436,with your store and stuff and for our
Woman031_Woman032_0437,store
Woman031_Woman032_0438,like giving you that I think that once
Woman031_Woman032_0439,you have more free time you'll be able
Woman031_Woman032_0440,to go out into the world but you still
Woman031_Woman032_0441,have a kid to raise also you should kick
Woman031_Woman032_0442,my butt and make me do like when those
Woman031_Woman032_0443,babies no don't do dating service just
Woman031_Woman032_0444,go into the world alright well we could
Woman031_Woman032_0445,do both okay when you were younger did
Woman031_Woman032_0446,you ever imagine having a kid like me
Woman031_Woman032_0447,[Laughter]
Woman031_Woman032_0448,what's one thing you've learned from my
Woman031_Woman032_0449,relationships that you'll carry into
Woman031_Woman032_0450,yours wow that's a big question because
Woman031_Woman032_0451,there's relationships there's so many

Woman031_Woman032_0456,lately you're like oh like you're seeing
Woman031_Woman032_0457,something else in her like your view of

Woman031_Woman032_0466,want us to have like negative feelings
Woman031_Woman032_0467,about judging people based on the way
Woman031_Woman032_0468,they look you know even though you care
Woman031_Woman032_0469,a lot about beauty and stuff like you
Woman031_Woman032_0470,still and you'll have your own little
Woman031_Woman032_0471,toxic like ill that about ill about
Woman031_Woman032_0472,someone
Woman031_Woman032_0473,for the most part I think you kind of
Woman031_Woman032_0474,try to check yourself and like see the
Woman031_Woman032_0475,inner beauty of people and I think that
Woman031_Woman032_0476,and also seeing even your relationship
Woman031_Woman032_0477,so it's like things you know like I've
Woman031_Woman032_0478,told you this before like I see like the
Woman031_Woman032_0479,beauty and little small things like
Woman031_Woman032_0480,little weird things just like you and
Woman031_Woman032_0481,also strangely I think like I don't know
Woman031_Woman032_0482,it in a sense even though it makes me
Woman031_Woman032_0483,sad that you're not with someone that
Woman031_Woman032_0484,like absence has taught me something
Woman031_Woman032_0485,about intimate relationships even though
Woman031_Woman032_0486,like I never was like watching and
Woman031_Woman032_0487,intimate relationship like just the
Woman031_Woman032_0488,knowing that I don't know know how to
Woman031_Woman032_0489,explain it like I think I just artists
Woman031_Woman032_0490,of the absence of a relationship right
Woman031_Woman032_0491,yeah I like have this I don't know I
Woman031_Woman032_0492,have this like I am a certain way with
Woman031_Woman032_0493,the opposite sex or like someone that
Woman031_Woman032_0494,I'm interested in because I didn't see a
Woman031_Woman032_0495,an intimate relationship growing up I
Woman031_Woman032_0496,don't know how to explain that any
Woman031_Woman032_0497,further but it's taught me something
Woman031_Woman032_0498,about like being in relationship even
Woman031_Woman032_0499,though you weren't okay okay
Woman031_Woman032_0500,oh I'm like all like shaky man cuz I
Woman031_Woman032_0501,just like got really sad but that was
Woman031_Woman032_0502,interesting and I like doing actually
Woman031_Woman032_0503,sitting here I was like it's hard for me
Woman031_Woman032_0504,to be having this conversation and
Woman031_Woman032_0505,acting like there isn't people around
Woman031_Woman032_0506,because there are and it made me think
Woman031_Woman032_0507,like I'd like to I don't know how we
Woman031_Woman032_0508,would do it but like I'd like to sit
Woman031_Woman032_0509,down and have like do this you know
Woman031_Woman032_0510,maybe not this everything but like just
Woman031_Woman032_0511,without people around yeah like like
Woman031_Woman032_0512,hear about your thoughts about their
Woman031_Woman032_0513,like like having cards because I mean
Woman031_Woman032_0514,it's not like it's like you're not the
Woman031_Woman032_0515,one who is asking the question in a way
Woman031_Woman032_0516,like there's that whole thing of oh no
Woman031_Woman032_0517,I'm not asking this question there this
Woman031_Woman032_0518,other person's asking wants me to ask
Woman031_Woman032_0519,you this question it's not me you know
Woman031_Woman032_0520,so you're kind of like innocent and so
Woman031_Woman032_0521,the person can't hold it against you for
Woman031_Woman032_0522,asking the question right they gives you
Woman031_Woman032_0523,a freedom there yeah I feel like you
Woman031_Woman032_0524,were a lot less defensive than you very
Woman031_Woman032_0525,still a little bit but that's natural
