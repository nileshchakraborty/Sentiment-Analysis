Man046_Woman051_0001,what are the three best memories we
Man046_Woman051_0002,share it's a difficult question I don't
Man046_Woman051_0003,really I was thinking of being in the
Man046_Woman051_0004,Chevy with all the boogie boards and
Man046_Woman051_0005,stuff piled in the back and then just
Man046_Woman051_0006,pulling up to the beach and knowing we
Man046_Woman051_0007,were gonna spend the day that's very
Man046_Woman051_0008,much you know and even though there's
Man046_Woman051_0009,part of me that was always nervous that
Man046_Woman051_0010,you guys weren't gonna like be near
Man046_Woman051_0011,where the lifeguard was or that they
Man046_Woman051_0012,just felt very carefree I think some of
Man046_Woman051_0013,the nice one of my nicest earliest
Man046_Woman051_0014,memories is when I would come home from
Man046_Woman051_0015,st. Mark's and I would be in the kitchen
Man046_Woman051_0016,and the light will be coming through the
Man046_Woman051_0017,windows and you'd cook me tortellini
Man046_Woman051_0018,from Jack about Zeus and I would just
Man046_Woman051_0019,sit at the table and eat it ya know I
Man046_Woman051_0020,have a difficult time with specific
Man046_Woman051_0021,memories there are one or two that are
Man046_Woman051_0022,in my mind but they're not really nice
Man046_Woman051_0023,ones they come to the surface because
Man046_Woman051_0024,our people always ask me that they say
Man046_Woman051_0025,oh do you remember this time do you
Man046_Woman051_0026,remember this was it I don't okay like

Man046_Woman051_0047,crossed white swords on the back and and
Man046_Woman051_0048,then just hoping you get ready to be the
Man046_Woman051_0049,character you wanted to be in different
Man046_Woman051_0050,ways and you you know digging through
Man046_Woman051_0051,the toy box to find like when you want

Man046_Woman051_0080,about me
Man046_Woman051_0081,done a lot of things that have taught me
Man046_Woman051_0082,a lot of things we've never done
Man046_Woman051_0083,anything ridiculous in my eyes you have
Man046_Woman051_0084,to put that on the light switches so
Man046_Woman051_0085,they didn't get all sloppy with paintin

Man046_Woman051_0094,preempt you here but it could mean could
Man046_Woman051_0095,be really good I thought about that I
Man046_Woman051_0096,think you know it'd be just really
Man046_Woman051_0097,stupid you don't really do stupid things
Man046_Woman051_0098,though ever I've never said I've never
Man046_Woman051_0099,thought something you've done is stupid
Man046_Woman051_0100,I may have not agreed with it but I've
Man046_Woman051_0101,maybe eventually understood why you've
Man046_Woman051_0102,done something
Man046_Woman051_0103,one of the on I want to answer the
Man046_Woman051_0104,question because I think it's a good
Man046_Woman051_0105,question but I'm trying to think
Man046_Woman051_0106,when was when was the time you were
Man046_Woman051_0107,proudest of me and why okay
Man046_Woman051_0108,proudest proudest may be getting up to
Man046_Woman051_0109,read that poem at your dad's memorial
Man046_Woman051_0110,service because nobody asked you to do
Man046_Woman051_0111,anything I didn't expect you to you know
Man046_Woman051_0112,you weren't even 13 and you found
Man046_Woman051_0113,something very special that meant
Man046_Woman051_0114,something to you that poem and you got
Man046_Woman051_0115,up and did it that made me feel like you
Man046_Woman051_0116,knew who you were and you wanted to yeah
Man046_Woman051_0117,I thought I did yeah what do you think
Man046_Woman051_0118,are my best quality
Man046_Woman051_0119,what do you think are my best qualities
Man046_Woman051_0120,as a mother sensitivity you know you
Man046_Woman051_0121,don't think everyone grows up the same
Man046_Woman051_0122,way as you do you think you know our old
Man046_Woman051_0123,parents love their children and do all
Man046_Woman051_0124,these things for their children and care
Man046_Woman051_0125,about them are not understanding in a
Man046_Woman051_0126,sensitive I'm forging is not the case
Man046_Woman051_0127,and understanding well you know everyone
Man046_Woman051_0128,asked me like you know what happened
Man046_Woman051_0129,with your work you know what did your
Man046_Woman051_0130,mom say what did you and I just tell
Man046_Woman051_0131,them sort of what you said to me when I
Man046_Woman051_0132,came home and I just said that I needed
Man046_Woman051_0133,your help I don't think there are many
Man046_Woman051_0134,people that have reacted like that
Man046_Woman051_0135,that's right that's amazing well you
Man046_Woman051_0136,asked for help both from people at work
Man046_Woman051_0137,and from me and I think that's that's
Man046_Woman051_0138,like one of the hardest things to do to
Man046_Woman051_0139,ask people for help just to like reach
Man046_Woman051_0140,out and hope that somebody's gonna come
Man046_Woman051_0141,towards you with something that's gonna
Man046_Woman051_0142,help and I find it hard to ask for help
Man046_Woman051_0143,I just I want to I want to be seen as
Man046_Woman051_0144,someone who knows how to get things done
Man046_Woman051_0145,you know what happened with your work
Man046_Woman051_0146,you know what did your mom say what did
Man046_Woman051_0147,you I just tell them sort of what you
Man046_Woman051_0148,said to me when I came home and I just
Man046_Woman051_0149,said that I needed your help I don't
Man046_Woman051_0150,know many people that have reacted like
Man046_Woman051_0151,that that's right
Man046_Woman051_0152,that's amazing well you asked for help
Man046_Woman051_0153,both from people at work and from me and
Man046_Woman051_0154,I think that's that's like one of the
Man046_Woman051_0155,hardest things to do to ask people for
Man046_Woman051_0156,help just to like reach out and hope
Man046_Woman051_0157,that somebody's gonna come towards you
Man046_Woman051_0158,and I find it hard to ask for help I
Man046_Woman051_0159,just I want to I want to be seen as
Man046_Woman051_0160,someone who knows how to get things done
Man046_Woman051_0161,what is the hardest thing about being a
Man046_Woman051_0162,mother well it's it's like watching
Man046_Woman051_0163,you're watching your child make mistakes
Man046_Woman051_0164,and I know that they're making them well
Man046_Woman051_0165,from from my point of view I'm not you
Man046_Woman051_0166,and I'm I'm not a young man in the
Man046_Woman051_0167,middle of a family of three boys who
Man046_Woman051_0168,lost their dad I grew up in a big in a
Man046_Woman051_0169,very different kind of a big nuclear
Man046_Woman051_0170,family and it's just really hard to see
Man046_Woman051_0171,your kids stumble and fall and not want
Man046_Woman051_0172,to run immediately and pick them up like
Man046_Woman051_0173,even when you were really little there
Man046_Woman051_0174,were other parents around like if their
Man046_Woman051_0175,kid you know like we had that big
Man046_Woman051_0176,climbing frame in back right and kids
Man046_Woman051_0177,from the neighborhood were always on the
Man046_Woman051_0178,slide or on that rope bridge and you
Man046_Woman051_0179,know kids were always falling often and
Man046_Woman051_0180,there were there they would be like as
Man046_Woman051_0181,soon as something happened with their
Man046_Woman051_0182,kid they brush them and go Oh be brave
Man046_Woman051_0183,be brave and I don't think that's really
Man046_Woman051_0184,the way the neighborhood were always on
Man046_Woman051_0185,the slide or on that rope bridge and you
Man046_Woman051_0186,know kids were always falling off and
Man046_Woman051_0187,and they were there they would be like
Man046_Woman051_0188,as soon as something happened with their
Man046_Woman051_0189,kid they brush them and go Oh be brave
Man046_Woman051_0190,be brave and I'd go no I just don't
Man046_Woman051_0191,think that's really the way to do it can
Man046_Woman051_0192,you just wait and see how your kid
Man046_Woman051_0193,reacts and know that they can kind of
Man046_Woman051_0194,just wait to see how much they can pick
Man046_Woman051_0195,themselves up and know how much help
Man046_Woman051_0196,they need but I would also say it's been
Man046_Woman051_0197,hard for me to have the courage to be
Man046_Woman051_0198,angry with you know I actually don't
Man046_Woman051_0199,think I've done that enough and to have
Man046_Woman051_0200,more strength of purpose behind what I
Man046_Woman051_0201,was thinking what's the biggest
Man046_Woman051_0202,sacrifice you think I've made for you
Man046_Woman051_0203,just dealing with me in general and not
Man046_Woman051_0204,sort of do you remember when I first
Man046_Woman051_0205,started going to therapy and a big thing
Man046_Woman051_0206,was that I was I didn't want to burden
Man046_Woman051_0207,you with anything else because of
Man046_Woman051_0208,everything else that you were dealing
Man046_Woman051_0209,with not because I felt insecure about
Man046_Woman051_0210,myself and I was insignificant and I but
Man046_Woman051_0211,just because my what I was feeling
Man046_Woman051_0212,relative to these other things that were
Man046_Woman051_0213,going on they were very important to me
Man046_Woman051_0214,but out there they seemed now doesn't
Man046_Woman051_0215,mean they wouldn't be important to you
Man046_Woman051_0216,and you told me that yeah my decision to
Man046_Woman051_0217,stop doing drugs was a much about me as
Man046_Woman051_0218,it was about you you know I just felt
Man046_Woman051_0219,like who the fuck am I to be doing that
Man046_Woman051_0220,again to you after what Raffy did
Man046_Woman051_0221,and someone you know sometimes I
Man046_Woman051_0222,wouldn't want to go home
Man046_Woman051_0223,you know before you know and Raph was
Man046_Woman051_0224,there and screaming and shouting and
Man046_Woman051_0225,throwing what was whining you know and I
Man046_Woman051_0226,but but then again I never thought like
Man046_Woman051_0227,oh I'll never do that because of him
Man046_Woman051_0228,which is strange people say that's so
Man046_Woman051_0229,weird you know why nothing of that makes
Man046_Woman051_0230,sense but it got well I understand the
Man046_Woman051_0231,sense of burden or not wanting to give
Man046_Woman051_0232,your parent more to worry about but I
Man046_Woman051_0233,think there's only so much you can think
Man046_Woman051_0234,about in terms of somebody else and that
Man046_Woman051_0235,I think maybe what you're saying it's
Man046_Woman051_0236,like ultimately the impact is on you and
Man046_Woman051_0237,and it's it's about you you can't always
Man046_Woman051_0238,be thinking of other people you can't
Man046_Woman051_0239,always thinking about how it affects me
Man046_Woman051_0240,what what happened with one of your
Man046_Woman051_0241,other siblings sure you're right no I
Man046_Woman051_0242,don't I'm not doing it all for other
Man046_Woman051_0243,people I'm also doing it because of what
Man046_Woman051_0244,I want to hopefully achieve and and all
Man046_Woman051_0245,these you know and everything else and I
Man046_Woman051_0246,want to be healthy and I want to be
Man046_Woman051_0247,happy you know a you know but I think
Man046_Woman051_0248,that is like a sacrifice to be able to
Man046_Woman051_0249,just put up with me
Man046_Woman051_0250,big one well I what I was feeling
Man046_Woman051_0251,relative to these other things that were
Man046_Woman051_0252,going on they were very important to me
Man046_Woman051_0253,but out there they seemed now doesn't
Man046_Woman051_0254,mean they wouldn't be important to you
Man046_Woman051_0255,and you told me that yeah but you know
Man046_Woman051_0256,my decision to stop doing drugs was a
Man046_Woman051_0257,much about me as it was about you you
Man046_Woman051_0258,know I just felt like who the fuck am I
Man046_Woman051_0259,to be doing that again to you after what
Man046_Woman051_0260,Raffy did and some lime you know
Man046_Woman051_0261,sometimes I wouldn't want to go home you
Man046_Woman051_0262,know before you know and Raph was there
Man046_Woman051_0263,and screaming and shouting and throwing
Man046_Woman051_0264,what was whining you know and I but but
Man046_Woman051_0265,then again I never thought like oh I'll
Man046_Woman051_0266,never do that because of him which is
Man046_Woman051_0267,strange people say that's so weird
Man046_Woman051_0268,you know why nothing of that makes sense
Man046_Woman051_0269,but it that well I understand the sense
Man046_Woman051_0270,of burden or not wanting to give your
Man046_Woman051_0271,parent more to worry about but I think
Man046_Woman051_0272,there's only so much you can think about
Man046_Woman051_0273,in terms of somebody else and that I
Man046_Woman051_0274,think maybe what you're saying it's like

Man046_Woman051_0287,that is like a sacrifice to be able to
Man046_Woman051_0288,just put up with me
Man046_Woman051_0289,what are you hesitant to tell me yeah
Man046_Woman051_0290,you should just go for it nobody said it
Man046_Woman051_0291,I think you have a sense you kind of
Man046_Woman051_0292,have an overdeveloped sense of
Man046_Woman051_0293,responsibility because of what happened
Man046_Woman051_0294,I agree and I I don't and and it also
Man046_Woman051_0295,gets back to me saying maybe I wish that
Man046_Woman051_0296,I'd been more hardline about you saying
Man046_Woman051_0297,in school you're actually boring
Man046_Woman051_0298,intellectually curious and I don't want
Man046_Woman051_0299,you to narrow down the world I think you
Man046_Woman051_0300,have a sense you kind of have an
Man046_Woman051_0301,overdeveloped sense of responsibility
Man046_Woman051_0302,because of what happened I agree and I I
Man046_Woman051_0303,don't and and it also gets back to me
Man046_Woman051_0304,saying maybe I wish that I'd been more
Man046_Woman051_0305,hardline about you staying in school
Man046_Woman051_0306,because I think you're a very you're
Man046_Woman051_0307,actually boring intellectually curious
Man046_Woman051_0308,and I don't want you to narrow down the
Man046_Woman051_0309,world cuz you've got really into
Man046_Woman051_0310,philosophy and economics and and you and
Man046_Woman051_0311,you've always been like you know you
Man046_Woman051_0312,couldn't decide whether it use your
Man046_Woman051_0313,right or your left hand when when you
Man046_Woman051_0314,were really small and you eventually
Man046_Woman051_0315,went through you're right and then the
Man046_Woman051_0316,same with your feet and you you know you
Man046_Woman051_0317,were such a good soccer player because
Man046_Woman051_0318,you could use your left foot and I
Man046_Woman051_0319,always felt like Benji's brain must be
Man046_Woman051_0320,like that - hmm
Man046_Woman051_0321,you know like the right side and the
Man046_Woman051_0322,left side there's so much crossing over
Man046_Woman051_0323,all the time and I just want I just want
Man046_Woman051_0324,you to keep as open as you can for both
Man046_Woman051_0325,sides to work as an SDK I think you're
Man046_Woman051_0326,right so it's my turn if you could
Man046_Woman051_0327,change one thing in our past present or
Man046_Woman051_0328,future what would it be and why
Man046_Woman051_0329,I mean that's there's such an obvious
Man046_Woman051_0330,answer to that but I feel that but at
Man046_Woman051_0331,the same time I don't want to say that
Man046_Woman051_0332,because it's like I'm Who I am now and
Man046_Woman051_0333,like I would but yes I wouldn't would
Man046_Woman051_0334,want my father to be alive yeah there
Man046_Woman051_0335,was one thing I want how do you think
Man046_Woman051_0336,our family's history has affected us I
Man046_Woman051_0337,think it's made us I think it's made us
Man046_Woman051_0338,I hope more sensitive people to each
Man046_Woman051_0339,other and to like I know you know three
Man046_Woman051_0340,brothers you go through different phases
Man046_Woman051_0341,and you know also I think a triangle is
Man046_Woman051_0342,difficult so if there's a pairing
Man046_Woman051_0343,there's always someone left out and I
Man046_Woman051_0344,feel like you're the one who's been left
Man046_Woman051_0345,out more between the relationships with
Man046_Woman051_0346,your brothers definitely and I
Man046_Woman051_0347,I just hope especially because of not
Man046_Woman051_0348,having your dad that the three of you
Man046_Woman051_0349,will eventually be super close not that
Man046_Woman051_0350,you're in you know well we are we're not

Man046_Woman051_0354,want there to be like the strongest
Man046_Woman051_0355,possible ties between us as we can
Man046_Woman051_0356,manage throughout our lives hmm so we
Man046_Woman051_0357,can't we can't take anyone's presence
Man046_Woman051_0358,for granted
Man046_Woman051_0359,we'll eventually be super close

Man046_Woman051_0429,granted I just thinking that's just
Man046_Woman051_0430,hoping that there was to the one that
Man046_Woman051_0431,there wasn't going to be any extra
Man046_Woman051_0432,additional problems I don't know if
Man046_Woman051_0433,that's maybe it is taking me for granted
Man046_Woman051_0434,for my behavior yeah making assumptions
Man046_Woman051_0435,about who I wanted you to be but it
Man046_Woman051_0436,didn't say it always said like that no
Man046_Woman051_0437,my behavior wasn't that wasn't wasn't
Man046_Woman051_0438,that bad but those things you were
Man046_Woman051_0439,selling that I found in that like the
Man046_Woman051_0440,footstool of that chair in your room
Man046_Woman051_0441,nitrous oxide canisters I mean you get
Man046_Woman051_0442,them from you get them from a dining
Man046_Woman051_0443,supply company for my behavior yeah
Man046_Woman051_0444,making assumptions about who I wanted
Man046_Woman051_0445,you to be but it didn't say always say
Man046_Woman051_0446,like that no my behavior wasn't that
Man046_Woman051_0447,wasn't wasn't that bad but those things
Man046_Woman051_0448,you were selling that I found in the
Man046_Woman051_0449,like the footstool of that chair in your
Man046_Woman051_0450,room
Man046_Woman051_0451,nitrous oxide canisters I mean you get
Man046_Woman051_0452,them from you get them from a dining
Man046_Woman051_0453,supply company whatever you could change
Man046_Woman051_0454,one thing about me what would it be and
Man046_Woman051_0455,why well nothing is hypothetically it's
Man046_Woman051_0456,not unchangeable but you're not a man
Man046_Woman051_0457,you know no and that's very difficult
Man046_Woman051_0458,sometimes only having a mother and then
Man046_Woman051_0459,the other men in your life being ones
Man046_Woman051_0460,that are so can could
Man046_Woman051_0461,so overbearing and want you to do so
Man046_Woman051_0462,much of the right thing the right
Man046_Woman051_0463,decision that that influence was always
Man046_Woman051_0464,a one out of love and like trying to
Man046_Woman051_0465,help but wasn't always the most helpful
Man046_Woman051_0466,I mean like Barbie
Man046_Woman051_0467,well like Bobbie or like jera or like I
Man046_Woman051_0468,mean Jerez not really like that actually
Man046_Woman051_0469,Jerry is actually amazing and I value
Man046_Woman051_0470,you know but but it's difficult when
Man046_Woman051_0471,you're a young boy growing up and you
Man046_Woman051_0472,want to do things and you have a mother
Man046_Woman051_0473,only a mother that's very sensitive and
Man046_Woman051_0474,cares a lot about your worries about you
Man046_Woman051_0475,you know and then and then I guess just
Man046_Woman051_0476,sometimes certain things I've wanted to
Man046_Woman051_0477,do and you haven't maybe that's just me
Man046_Woman051_0478,being sort of spoil and wanting to out
Man046_Woman051_0479,wanting you to agree with everything
Man046_Woman051_0480,that I want to do but that also is about
Man046_Woman051_0481,your life and where you've come from in
Man046_Woman051_0482,your family and I'm very grateful to
Man046_Woman051_0483,have to have had parents who come from
Man046_Woman051_0484,very different type and then I guess
Man046_Woman051_0485,just sometimes certain things I've
Man046_Woman051_0486,wanted to do and you haven't maybe
Man046_Woman051_0487,that's just me being sort of spoiled and
Man046_Woman051_0488,wanting to have wanting you to agree
Man046_Woman051_0489,with everything that I want to do but
Man046_Woman051_0490,that also is about your life and where
Man046_Woman051_0491,you've come from in your family and I'm
Man046_Woman051_0492,very grateful to have to have had
Man046_Woman051_0493,parents who come from very different
Man046_Woman051_0494,types of places you know it's a big part
Man046_Woman051_0495,of me being able to sort of accept more
Man046_Woman051_0496,people and you know not like not like
Man046_Woman051_0497,one's white and lived in a palace and
Man046_Woman051_0498,one's you know green and you know grew
Man046_Woman051_0499,up on another planet but you did
Man046_Woman051_0500,certainly come from different parts of
Man046_Woman051_0501,the world different and that's I think
Man046_Woman051_0502,that's an amazing thing for me to have
Man046_Woman051_0503,grown up in a in a house where there you
Man046_Woman051_0504,know people from different places yeah
Man046_Woman051_0505,yeah I don't I don't feel like you guys

Man046_Woman051_0524,I know it's like a normal disk and this
Man046_Woman051_0525,isn't about family isn't about normal
Man046_Woman051_0526,isn't about normal what's right or
Man046_Woman051_0527,what's wrong it's just like I can't
Man046_Woman051_0528,control my feelings towards it and I
Man046_Woman051_0529,don't care where I am or what I'm doing
Man046_Woman051_0530,or if I'm in a big house or a small
Man046_Woman051_0531,house or you know I love being let my
Man046_Woman051_0532,memories of that Christmas of Christmas
Man046_Woman051_0533,is there are some of my most wonderful
Man046_Woman051_0534,memories but maybe it's because I also
Man046_Woman051_0535,stopped you know stopped drinking and so
Man046_Woman051_0536,when people do drink and want to drink
Man046_Woman051_0537,it's much more apparent to me because
Man046_Woman051_0538,I'm like looking and I'm also trying to
Man046_Woman051_0539,protect myself yeah yeah but I also you
Man046_Woman051_0540,know it's also about not necessarily
Man046_Woman051_0541,about not having a good time there but
Man046_Woman051_0542,it's also missing the other family so
Man046_Woman051_0543,when you grow like I'm sure being in
Man046_Woman051_0544,London you missed your American family
Man046_Woman051_0545,like who the fuck are these people like
Man046_Woman051_0546,doing this stuff like and like they care
Man046_Woman051_0547,about all these things that like wow you
Man046_Woman051_0548,know I'm not saying they're different
Man046_Woman051_0549,like different completely different
Man046_Woman051_0550,human beings but I'm sure you felt that
Man046_Woman051_0551,at times and so I got I miss them
Man046_Woman051_0552,you want to ask the next one is it me is
Man046_Woman051_0553,it me maybe it's me means but I'm sure
Man046_Woman051_0554,you felt that at times and so like that
Man046_Woman051_0555,I miss them you know you want to ask the
Man046_Woman051_0556,next one is it me is it me maybe it's me
Man046_Woman051_0557,you could ask I wanted to carry on
Man046_Woman051_0558,talking now what mistakes do you see me
Man046_Woman051_0559,making that you have also made what
Man046_Woman051_0560,would you advise me to do I you know
Man046_Woman051_0561,what I think it's a sense of
Man046_Woman051_0562,responsibility I think it's I think it's
Man046_Woman051_0563,I grew up in the middle of a big family
Man046_Woman051_0564,and I'm always weighing up one side the
Man046_Woman051_0565,other I'm I'm being I'm always I am
Man046_Woman051_0566,aware of being thinking a lot about
Man046_Woman051_0567,other people so not selfish enough I
Man046_Woman051_0568,don't I'm not saying be ruthless and go
Man046_Woman051_0569,for whatever you want at any cost but I
Man046_Woman051_0570,think they're know people have said that
Man046_Woman051_0571,to me not so much recently but people
Man046_Woman051_0572,have said that to me before that I
Man046_Woman051_0573,haven't looked out for myself enough
Man046_Woman051_0574,when or what was the toughest moment in
Man046_Woman051_0575,our relationship and how do you feel
Man046_Woman051_0576,about it now
Man046_Woman051_0577,the toughest moment in our relationship
Man046_Woman051_0578,I think the toughest moment in our
Man046_Woman051_0579,relationship was more about me than it
Man046_Woman051_0580,was about you but I don't really see it
Man046_Woman051_0581,as I am moment there are a lot of
Man046_Woman051_0582,different times that come to mind for me
Man046_Woman051_0583,I think you know in you know one might
Man046_Woman051_0584,think Oh it'll be you know when when
Man046_Woman051_0585,when Dad died and that that that that
Man046_Woman051_0586,for me it was like such an overarching
Man046_Woman051_0587,powerful thing that there wasn't really
Man046_Woman051_0588,anything else existing at the time it
Man046_Woman051_0589,was just that and it was everywhere and
Man046_Woman051_0590,so it wasn't like this is difficult come
Man046_Woman051_0591,it was just like that's what it is right
Man046_Woman051_0592,now yeah so I guess I guess it was
Man046_Woman051_0593,difficult for me when when I sort of
Man046_Woman051_0594,realized that I could you know that that
Man046_Woman051_0595,wasn't like my whole life that there was
Man046_Woman051_0596,a that there was you know that I could
Man046_Woman051_0597,decide to be the type of person I wanted
Man046_Woman051_0598,to be and like but I didn't really I
Man046_Woman051_0599,don't think I really knew how to be yes
Man046_Woman051_0600,when I was younger and I wasn't behaving
Man046_Woman051_0601,very well and I just didn't care what
Man046_Woman051_0602,anyone told me didn't want to listen to
Man046_Woman051_0603,anyone but then again also when you know
Man046_Woman051_0604,you've been depressed about Rafi or
Man046_Woman051_0605,something else and like just when
Man046_Woman051_0606,someone's depressed they're not really
Man046_Woman051_0607,nice to be around yeah yeah so I love
Man046_Woman051_0608,having that's why I she loved selfishly
Man046_Woman051_0609,I love Ned being around more than not
Man046_Woman051_0610,being around because he makes you very
Man046_Woman051_0611,happy and then that makes the atmosphere
Man046_Woman051_0612,and the environment more happy and it's
Man046_Woman051_0613,a nicer one to be around I mean that's I
Man046_Woman051_0614,mean also I like the heat that you get
Man046_Woman051_0615,on so Ellen whatever it is that you feel
Man046_Woman051_0616,between each other I don't entirely know
Man046_Woman051_0617,about it's a bit benefits me you think
Man046_Woman051_0618,even now like even though I'm with Ned
Man046_Woman051_0619,and when he's not with us I'm still
Man046_Woman051_0620,depressed no I don't mean that at all I
Man046_Woman051_0621,just mean you're happy and more
Man046_Woman051_0622,lighthearted when he's around no I don't
Man046_Woman051_0623,I don't I don't think you've been
Man046_Woman051_0624,I haven't seen you as been depressed
Man046_Woman051_0625,like that for a long time put that down
Man046_Woman051_0626,on paper and have other people see it I
Man046_Woman051_0627,mean I think you've kind of I mean it's
Man046_Woman051_0628,not it's pretty much you and Raffi and
Man046_Woman051_0629,Sandro and Sam that's what it is that's
Man046_Woman051_0630,exactly what it is actually it is
Man046_Woman051_0631,there's no getting around that it's not
Man046_Woman051_0632,anyone else and it's all from experience
Man046_Woman051_0633,and I think I think it's very brave to
Man046_Woman051_0634,put that down I mean not everyone will
Man046_Woman051_0635,know exactly but I mean the people
Man046_Woman051_0636,who've seen it so far do I think that's
Man046_Woman051_0637,very no what is it really about maybe
Man046_Woman051_0638,it's about it's a it's another way of
Man046_Woman051_0639,being able to sort of release and sort
Man046_Woman051_0640,of grieve in a way and and move and move
Man046_Woman051_0641,forward you know like really getting
Man046_Woman051_0642,something out as much you can yeah it's
Man046_Woman051_0643,a very therapeutic thing sometimes it
Man046_Woman051_0644,feels that way sometimes it doesn't it's
Man046_Woman051_0645,like you have to go over and over it
Man046_Woman051_0646,again you have to rewrite you have to
Man046_Woman051_0647,listen to other people say the words and
Man046_Woman051_0648,you you know you have to be committed to
Man046_Woman051_0649,it and I think there was a part of me
Man046_Woman051_0650,that's like whoa get it out throw it on
Man046_Woman051_0651,the page whether it looks like vomit or
Man046_Woman051_0652,not and now it's like oh fuck I've got
Man046_Woman051_0653,to stick with this and I have to look at
Man046_Woman051_0654,it in different ways so it's taken on a
Man046_Woman051_0655,different life than I then was what I
Man046_Woman051_0656,thought originally how am i how am i
Man046_Woman051_0657,most like you and how does that scare
Man046_Woman051_0658,you I think we touched on it sort of you
Man046_Woman051_0659,know you being like a responsible person
Man046_Woman051_0660,and thinking a lot about others and and
Man046_Woman051_0661,I I I don't know maybe it's also
Man046_Woman051_0662,drinking you know like you know there's
Man046_Woman051_0663,a lot of bit of my family I'm yeah
Man046_Woman051_0664,definitely
Man046_Woman051_0665,forward having a drink even we were
Man046_Woman051_0666,talking yesterday out at Denise's for
Man046_Woman051_0667,her Kentucky Derby party that she
Man046_Woman051_0668,admitted that she she buys wine in those
Man046_Woman051_0669,cartons yeah so she can't voices you
Man046_Woman051_0670,know why so she can't tell how much
Man046_Woman051_0671,she's had to drink if you have a bottle
Man046_Woman051_0672,you can see it go down you can think oh
Man046_Woman051_0673,maybe I should stop her oh that's not so
Man046_Woman051_0674,bad
Man046_Woman051_0675,huh I was like wow okay we you know we
Man046_Woman051_0676,got a plan here and it made me realize
Man046_Woman051_0677,how many how many things we think about
Man046_Woman051_0678,are involved in the process of doing it
Man046_Woman051_0679,and it was horrifying for me that after
Man046_Woman051_0680,everything with Rafi you had I'm sure
Man046_Woman051_0681,you've done more and that you haven't
Man046_Woman051_0682,even told me about but I mean the idea
Man046_Woman051_0683,that it was hard it was horrifying for
Man046_Woman051_0684,me that after everything with Rafi you
Man046_Woman051_0685,had I'm sure you've done more that you
Man046_Woman051_0686,haven't even told me about but I mean
Man046_Woman051_0687,the idea that it was hard drugs as well
Man046_Woman051_0688,as well I see that's not true actually
Man046_Woman051_0689,I've never really done anything hard
Man046_Woman051_0690,drugs I've never done anything but
Man046_Woman051_0691,cocaine okay that's a really hard drug
Man046_Woman051_0692,I'm just saying you said other things
Man046_Woman051_0693,you already knew about that right yeah I
Man046_Woman051_0694,guess I hoped it was only alcohol but
Man046_Woman051_0695,actually statistically I think it's the
Man046_Woman051_0696,thing that is worse for you and anything
Man046_Woman051_0697,else so anyway I don't want to I just
Man046_Woman051_0698,that's what I that's you know part of me
Man046_Woman051_0699,that is also obviously in you that that
Man046_Woman051_0700,scares me hard drugs I've never done
Man046_Woman051_0701,anything but cocaine okay that's a
Man046_Woman051_0702,really hard drug I'm just saying you
Man046_Woman051_0703,said other things you already knew about
Man046_Woman051_0704,that right yeah I guess I hoped it was
Man046_Woman051_0705,only alcohol but actually statistically
Man046_Woman051_0706,I think it's the thing that is worse for
Man046_Woman051_0707,you and anything else so anyway I don't
Man046_Woman051_0708,want to huh
Man046_Woman051_0709,I just that's what I that's you know a
Man046_Woman051_0710,part of me that is also obviously in you
Man046_Woman051_0711,that that scares me
Man046_Woman051_0712,what's the pain in me you'd like to heal
Man046_Woman051_0713,I mean it's on I guess it's unhealable I
Man046_Woman051_0714,mean maybe that's a very cynical way of
Man046_Woman051_0715,looking at it and it's funny cuz I was
Man046_Woman051_0716,gonna I was in my mind I was answering
Man046_Woman051_0717,that question for you I was gonna say
Man046_Woman051_0718,I'm actually healing you are healing
Man046_Woman051_0719,right now
Man046_Woman051_0720,well yeah I suppose through this but
Man046_Woman051_0721,also just in general with maybe writing
Man046_Woman051_0722,the play and having moved and knowing
Man046_Woman051_0723,that I needed to start life on my own
Man046_Woman051_0724,terms somewhere else instead of in
Man046_Woman051_0725,London with another family but that was
Man046_Woman051_0726,not my question to answer correct it was
Man046_Woman051_0727,not I mean I don't think I know enough
Man046_Woman051_0728,about your pain your deep pains to
Man046_Woman051_0729,really answer that properly I mean I can
Man046_Woman051_0730,assume what what things have caused you
Man046_Woman051_0731,a lot of pain but I guess there's yeah
Man046_Woman051_0732,what you said is true I think you made a
Man046_Woman051_0733,lot of massive steps to move in the
Man046_Woman051_0734,direction that you want to move in and
Man046_Woman051_0735,find you know hopefully done a lot of
Man046_Woman051_0736,things for yourself you know not worry
Man046_Woman051_0737,too much about us or what we thought or
Man046_Woman051_0738,where we were or I don't know if you
Man046_Woman051_0739,feel you do more I don't know if you
Man046_Woman051_0740,feel you should do more of that and you
Man046_Woman051_0741,haven't done enough I don't know how
Man046_Woman051_0742,you're doing each no I know that but I
Man046_Woman051_0743,mean right now I'm wondering and I hope
Man046_Woman051_0744,mozi is like writing an essay Wow
Man046_Woman051_0745,how do you think my father's passing
Man046_Woman051_0746,affected me different than my brothers
Man046_Woman051_0747,I don't I don't know why I'm having a
Man046_Woman051_0748,hard time answering that because there's
Man046_Woman051_0749,something sort of maybe more superficial
Man046_Woman051_0750,than I can think that doesn't feel say
Man046_Woman051_0751,them well I I feel one of the things
Man046_Woman051_0752,that you always got from him was you
Man046_Woman051_0753,know that that sort of super athleticism
Man046_Woman051_0754,and he was always on it with you he
Man046_Woman051_0755,always wanted to be part of it with you
Man046_Woman051_0756,and I and also academically I mean I
Man046_Woman051_0757,just I just think he could have helped
Man046_Woman051_0758,you more when you got older and that you
Man046_Woman051_0759,might you might have taken a different
Man046_Woman051_0760,path or maybe just stayed in school or
Man046_Woman051_0761,gone going to university in London and I
Man046_Woman051_0762,don't mean I'm not saying it because I
Man046_Woman051_0763,wanted you to go to Cambridge or
Man046_Woman051_0764,something it was just that I think you
Man046_Woman051_0765,would have been on like a stronger
Man046_Woman051_0766,narrower path somehow and that it all
Man046_Woman051_0767,started to kind of like seep out in
Man046_Woman051_0768,these different directions when do you
Man046_Woman051_0769,worry about me and why I don't really
Man046_Woman051_0770,sorry I don't anymore I don't get I
Man046_Woman051_0771,think there's so much has happened that
Man046_Woman051_0772,right now the water is relatively
Man046_Woman051_0773,extremely calm yeah so I don't and I
Man046_Woman051_0774,actually really like the fact that I
Man046_Woman051_0775,don't because it makes my life a lot
Man046_Woman051_0776,easier because a lot of my life before a
Man046_Woman051_0777,lot when I was young it was just like
Man046_Woman051_0778,hoping that you were okay yeah you know
Man046_Woman051_0779,and just like feeling so angry at
Man046_Woman051_0780,everyone else and what had happened it's
Man046_Woman051_0781,just not fair on anyone but you know
Man046_Woman051_0782,nothing's ever fair of course no I'm
Man046_Woman051_0783,really really nice for me to say that
Man046_Woman051_0784,not that I don't care you know but I
Man046_Woman051_0785,just don't worry in the same way that I
Man046_Woman051_0786,used to
Man046_Woman051_0787,that's really nice thing to say hmm
Man046_Woman051_0788,what's one lesson or idea you want me to
Man046_Woman051_0789,never forget
Man046_Woman051_0790,I think it's about I just think it's
Man046_Woman051_0791,about resilience I think about and I
Man046_Woman051_0792,feel like you are learning this lesson
Man046_Woman051_0793,mmm you've been knocked down a lot for
Man046_Woman051_0794,different reasons health issues and
Man046_Woman051_0795,everything else and just just to keep
Man046_Woman051_0796,getting up and trying I actually find it
Man046_Woman051_0797,really hard I'm I'm someone who to do it
Man046_Woman051_0798,yourself yeah I find it really really
Man046_Woman051_0799,hard to follow through and not let other
Man046_Woman051_0800,people's opinion knock me back and I
Man046_Woman051_0801,just want that to be a lesson that you
Man046_Woman051_0802,never forget hmm I don't think it comes
Man046_Woman051_0803,from one specific lesson having bent
Man046_Woman051_0804,learnt I think it's the lifelong thing
Man046_Woman051_0805,I'm saying it for me - hmm - what do you
Man046_Woman051_0806,think is special about our relationship
Man046_Woman051_0807,I think that I mean I think that we care
Man046_Woman051_0808,a huge amount about each other and love
Man046_Woman051_0809,each other huge amount which sets should
Man046_Woman051_0810,sound normal you know should be a normal
Man046_Woman051_0811,thing but I don't think it is you know
Man046_Woman051_0812,I've just a lot of people I've met don't
Man046_Woman051_0813,have that type of relationship I think
Man046_Woman051_0814,we're very sensitive to each other I
Man046_Woman051_0815,hope I'm saying that more that happy
Man046_Woman051_0816,that you feel that I'm that you I know
Man046_Woman051_0817,that you're that to me I only tried to
Man046_Woman051_0818,do that
Man046_Woman051_0819,I also like the fact that maybe it is
Man046_Woman051_0820,because I because I dad's not here but I
Man046_Woman051_0821,like the fact that I've been able to
Man046_Woman051_0822,sort of help if like Mose has a problem
Man046_Woman051_0823,some with like something that you two
Man046_Woman051_0824,are discussing you know he will come to
Man046_Woman051_0825,me and say you know like can you help me
Man046_Woman051_0826,with this or just I like that we can
Man046_Woman051_0827,discuss you know and you're listening to
Man046_Woman051_0828,me and you're you actually value my
Man046_Woman051_0829,opinion there are a lot of people out
Man046_Woman051_0830,there that say yeah yeah okay yeah
Man046_Woman051_0831,that's a great idea
Man046_Woman051_0832,you know like cool you're 17 or you're
Man046_Woman051_0833,22 or you're 10 very sweet that you're
Man046_Woman051_0834,saying that but I'll stick to my yeah I
Man046_Woman051_0835,think you actually consider my opinion
Man046_Woman051_0836,on things if it's something that we're
Man046_Woman051_0837,discussing right in regards to something
Man046_Woman051_0838,or someone else or you know just like
Man046_Woman051_0839,when I when I was deciding whether to
Man046_Woman051_0840,not stay in school or not and work you
Man046_Woman051_0841,know we really talked about it we talked
Man046_Woman051_0842,about you didn't really do it I that's
Man046_Woman051_0843,not the point
Man046_Woman051_0844,that's not the point I would hope that
Man046_Woman051_0845,whatever I would say you would still do
Man046_Woman051_0846,what you wanted to do that's me singing
Man046_Woman051_0847,so I can just feel like I can I can do
Man046_Woman051_0848,whatever I want to do but yeah it's a
Man046_Woman051_0849,boring one we've already answered that
Man046_Woman051_0850,don't we have to stare at each other for
Man046_Woman051_0851,10 seconds why do you love me how could
Man046_Woman051_0852,I not love you oh my god I think that's
Man046_Woman051_0853,a terrible question so you don't answer
Man046_Woman051_0854,no because I just I
Man046_Woman051_0855,you're my little benjamine oh I used to
Man046_Woman051_0856,call you my honey-coated mischief-maker
Man046_Woman051_0857,oh my god so sweet and you didn't always
Man046_Woman051_0858,want to go out either it's really nice
Man046_Woman051_0859,to watch videos with you and there's so
Man046_Woman051_0860,many things
Man046_Woman051_0861,I think you're like just a really
Man046_Woman051_0862,beautiful person I'm really really proud
Man046_Woman051_0863,that you're my son
