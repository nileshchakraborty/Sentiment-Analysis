Man049_Woman054_0001,I do this all the time you are very
Man049_Woman054_0002,creeping out and then has to tell you
Man049_Woman054_0003,stuff
Man049_Woman054_0004,what do you think about the first time
Man049_Woman054_0005,you met what do you remember
Man049_Woman054_0006,oh we've had this conversation before I
Man049_Woman054_0007,remember it's a really cute guy and we
Man049_Woman054_0008,talked about politics he was drunk
Man049_Woman054_0009,I didn't know that you told me after the
Man049_Woman054_0010,fact I had no idea
Man049_Woman054_0011,yeah and liked her political views yeah
Man049_Woman054_0012,and I think I probably clearly this at
Man049_Woman054_0013,one point but that was one of the
Man049_Woman054_0014,initial moments right realized that
Man049_Woman054_0015,maybe drinking wasn't something I'm
Man049_Woman054_0016,gonna do it in the long turn because you
Man049_Woman054_0017,said you were looking for volunteers to
Man049_Woman054_0018,lucky to the subway rather sketchy
Man049_Woman054_0019,neighborhood couldn't blame you and you
Man049_Woman054_0020,didn't know I was drunk because you said
Man049_Woman054_0021,and I would ask you but I'm sorry you're
Man049_Woman054_0022,too drunk yeah yeah well no that was
Man049_Woman054_0023,like guyot if I had enough all that

Man049_Woman054_0034,and I remember you were there with your
Man049_Woman054_0035,sister and I remember I said you know
Man049_Woman054_0036,I'm just a little nervous about the
Man049_Woman054_0037,prospect of killing Bushman I think that
Man049_Woman054_0038,might make him a martyr and maybe
Man049_Woman054_0039,there's some way we get this cut it in
Man049_Woman054_0040,then peach and something like that and
Man049_Woman054_0041,you said he said no no I think we should

Man049_Woman054_0085,what's your favorite thing about them
Man049_Woman054_0086,that is a tough question and I was
Man049_Woman054_0087,afraid that there's gonna be one of the
Man049_Woman054_0088,questions because I could pick so many
Man049_Woman054_0089,things I think I would have to say it is
Man049_Woman054_0090,your compassion and your smile can I go
Man049_Woman054_0091,with the type and you're hearing okay

Man049_Woman054_0096,you but let's start with your compassion
Man049_Woman054_0097,I'm amazed at your ability to show love
Man049_Woman054_0098,and support and understanding to people
Man049_Woman054_0099,and situations that I find myself very
Man049_Woman054_0100,challenged in I I find I get rattled by
Man049_Woman054_0101,people I get tech knocked by people and
Man049_Woman054_0102,I want to brush people F but right
Man049_Woman054_0103,people laugh but the fact that you're
Man049_Woman054_0104,always able to meet people on their own
Man049_Woman054_0105,terms and doesn't doesn't mean that you
Man049_Woman054_0106,despise the person questions but but if
Man049_Woman054_0107,you if you in the person have a common
Man049_Woman054_0108,goal which is certainly the case and you
Man049_Woman054_0109,know the activist work that you do and
Man049_Woman054_0110,you've introduced me to you're able to
Man049_Woman054_0111,lay aside differences and build

Man049_Woman054_0125,getting through I cannot pull out of
Man049_Woman054_0126,this you know
Man049_Woman054_0127,IT emergency this this is hard drive
Man049_Woman054_0128,crash or whatever I considered emergency
Man049_Woman054_0129,in the course of my day
Man049_Woman054_0130,so I love that ya know you went to
Man049_Woman054_0131,college it's only because I there are so
Man049_Woman054_0132,many things that I love about to you but
Man049_Woman054_0133,that's probably my top favorite thing
Man049_Woman054_0134,like to you especially I think in
Man049_Woman054_0135,situations where you haven't had a
Man049_Woman054_0136,personal exposure most of us are
Man049_Woman054_0137,activists because we've had some kind of
Man049_Woman054_0138,personal connection to it you know a lot
Man049_Woman054_0139,of us in the women's rights movement
Man049_Woman054_0140,we've had women we love treated badly
Man049_Woman054_0141,and that filled us you've cared about
Man049_Woman054_0142,people and groups that have had
Man049_Woman054_0143,absolutely no connection to like your
Man049_Woman054_0144,work against Islamophobia alone before
Man049_Woman054_0145,you knew me I think just danger really
Man049_Woman054_0146,touches me because you know even as an
Man049_Woman054_0147,activist I choose things that I have
Man049_Woman054_0148,personal connections to but you've
Man049_Woman054_0149,chosen things that you just you just
Man049_Woman054_0150,went out there to learn about Islam
Man049_Woman054_0151,because you saw this learn will be out
Man049_Woman054_0152,there without any personal connection
Man049_Woman054_0153,because he wanted to speak up about it I
Man049_Woman054_0154,just think that's I wish everybody was
Man049_Woman054_0155,like that well thank you I was like you
Man049_Woman054_0156,but I feel I gonna be self-centered
Man049_Woman054_0157,align these self-centered person in the
Man049_Woman054_0158,world this is not this is not me going
Man049_Woman054_0159,for flattery on camera this is I mean I
Man049_Woman054_0160,used I feel that I can be I feel that I
Man049_Woman054_0161,I actually can't get caught up in my I
Man049_Woman054_0162,wish I wish you know you heard what your
Man049_Woman054_0163,family and me and the people who love

Man049_Woman054_0170,Clyde you want full of yourself and I
Man049_Woman054_0171,was like I'm not dealing with that again
Man049_Woman054_0172,and here I kind of wish you were full of
Man049_Woman054_0173,yourself because you're just so humble
Man049_Woman054_0174,because we're on the phone the the first
Man049_Woman054_0175,cup like long phone conversation we have
Man049_Woman054_0176,and I was turning to flirt with you and
Man049_Woman054_0177,it was totally going over your head so I
Man049_Woman054_0178,somehow it came out that you had German
Man049_Woman054_0179,ancestry so I said oh yeah German said
Man049_Woman054_0180,to be really good-looking and like it
Man049_Woman054_0181,didn't even register with you just kept
Man049_Woman054_0182,talking and I was like is this one of
Man049_Woman054_0183,these other good-looking jerks because
Man049_Woman054_0184,I'm not going down that path
Man049_Woman054_0185,I'm sorry mind is really bad
Man049_Woman054_0186,good-looking no no I know you I know now
Man049_Woman054_0187,you must have been picking like I'm not
Man049_Woman054_0188,doing this again
Man049_Woman054_0189,like I'd repeat my system the PT to you
Man049_Woman054_0190,know make sure that you heard me I just
Man049_Woman054_0191,didn't yeah
Man049_Woman054_0192,I mean what I had to do to convince you
Man049_Woman054_0193,that that I actually liked you and and
Man049_Woman054_0194,it worked because you did ask me out
Man049_Woman054_0195,finally the end of the conversation I
Man049_Woman054_0196,mean it was the first time you know that
Man049_Woman054_0197,everybody alright well what do you a lot
Man049_Woman054_0198,of better relationship oh there's so
Man049_Woman054_0199,many things I'm about your relationship
Man049_Woman054_0200,I you know I I loved I so many of our
Man049_Woman054_0201,friends and family members look at us as
Man049_Woman054_0202,the perfect relationship does what they
Man049_Woman054_0203,aspire to be and especially as you know
Man049_Woman054_0204,working on the one that's right smooth
Man049_Woman054_0205,men I see so many girlfriends who are
Man049_Woman054_0206,just with these colossal jerks who are
Man049_Woman054_0207,strong and beautiful and smart but
Man049_Woman054_0208,they're with these jerks because that's
Man049_Woman054_0209,what society teaches us you know you you
Man049_Woman054_0210,shouldn't like the bad boys who treats
Man049_Woman054_0211,you like crap and we give them the
Man049_Woman054_0212,example of white a healthy really she
Man049_Woman054_0213,should canna be like what a beautiful
Man049_Woman054_0214,supportive true partnership can look
Man049_Woman054_0215,like you know like all the wonderful
Man049_Woman054_0216,goodness aspects and like we don't
Man049_Woman054_0217,compromise on anything we we're
Man049_Woman054_0218,adventurous and we really support each
Man049_Woman054_0219,other I think most relationships even
Man049_Woman054_0220,the most loving relationships it's very
Man049_Woman054_0221,very hard to find that balance somebody
Man049_Woman054_0222,is always a little more somebody's
Man049_Woman054_0223,always taking a little bit more whether
Man049_Woman054_0224,somebody's a little more I don't know
Man049_Woman054_0225,where they're somebody does more than
Man049_Woman054_0226,the house or somebody not more than the
Man049_Woman054_0227,house like how do I explain this
Man049_Woman054_0228,somebody's ego is always taking care of
Man049_Woman054_0229,more than the others in relationships
Man049_Woman054_0230,even in very very loving relationships
Man049_Woman054_0231,but I don't think that's the case in our
Man049_Woman054_0232,relationship we are each other's biggest
Man049_Woman054_0233,cheerleaders we really support each
Man049_Woman054_0234,other like we really are not jealous of
Man049_Woman054_0235,each other
Man049_Woman054_0236,we're not insecure of each other and I
Man049_Woman054_0237,think that is huge and our communication
Man049_Woman054_0238,it's not like we don't argue bye we're
Man049_Woman054_0239,so honest with each other and we're just
Man049_Woman054_0240,it's our communication you even laugh at
Man049_Woman054_0241,my horrendous jokes
Man049_Woman054_0242,I got I got a year you're lucky you're
Man049_Woman054_0243,cute as opposed to you shaking your head
Man049_Woman054_0244,no yeah I mean absolutely I think I
Man049_Woman054_0245,think that I think the fact that I just
Man049_Woman054_0246,love I just love how many things you've
Man049_Woman054_0247,shared with me of a conceptual nature I
Man049_Woman054_0248,mean like for instance this was this was
Man049_Woman054_0249,on my reader but the whole idea of the
Man049_Woman054_0250,slippery slope of boundaries you know
Man049_Woman054_0251,like like you've talked about it in in
Man049_Woman054_0252,the activist field looking at violence
Man049_Woman054_0253,you mean it's a spectrum that begins
Man049_Woman054_0254,with boundaries not being respected and
Man049_Woman054_0255,you know this woman I always thought I
Man049_Woman054_0256,had been pretty good at you know I think
Man049_Woman054_0257,I had them a decent job of it but I mean
Man049_Woman054_0258,it's something this simple is I you know
Man049_Woman054_0259,I'm really not in the mood to take your
Man049_Woman054_0260,bad jokes right now so oh they're not to
Man049_Woman054_0261,tell them no but I mean even something
Man049_Woman054_0262,like that just kind of helping to
Man049_Woman054_0263,understand just kind of how that
Man049_Woman054_0264,spectrum works and and how I think I can
Man049_Woman054_0265,kind of be part of the solution even you
Man049_Woman054_0266,know mine either way I just kind of not
Man049_Woman054_0267,contributing to the problem you know in
Man049_Woman054_0268,my native and so I I feel like you
Man049_Woman054_0269,helped me to see my place in the world
Man049_Woman054_0270,really and I don't mean that like sort
Man049_Woman054_0271,of a caste system capacity but you know
Man049_Woman054_0272,like more my capacity to to contribute
Man049_Woman054_0273,to the world in in a substantive way I
Man049_Woman054_0274,really hope that youth I really love
Man049_Woman054_0275,that you've helped me with that and I
Man049_Woman054_0276,love the fact that we can you know
Man049_Woman054_0277,everything you teach me I I think I love
Man049_Woman054_0278,that about us is that we have knowledge
Man049_Woman054_0279,in different fields and we're always
Man049_Woman054_0280,done reaching each other
Man049_Woman054_0281,just going back to kind of what the egos
Man049_Woman054_0282,where you know there are men who will
Man049_Woman054_0283,take women who days
Man049_Woman054_0284,not that smart so they cannot like
Man049_Woman054_0285,always feel smarter or maybe women
Man049_Woman054_0286,who'll take men that they think are not
Man049_Woman054_0287,as attractive so they can always be the
Man049_Woman054_0288,attractive person of the couple
Man049_Woman054_0289,we're just we're all about bringing each
Man049_Woman054_0290,other up and making the other person
Man049_Woman054_0291,better I can honestly say I'm a better
Man049_Woman054_0292,person since I'm gonna deal and you know
Man049_Woman054_0293,I hope I hope that for everybody for any
Man049_Woman054_0294,relationship when do you feel closest to
Man049_Woman054_0295,me I would have to say it's when we're
Man049_Woman054_0296,watching Star Gate or guardian or
Man049_Woman054_0297,Firefly or I don't know I guess whatever
Man049_Woman054_0298,the next show will be after we finish
Man049_Woman054_0299,this the run that we're done and we're
Man049_Woman054_0300,staying on the couch and we've managed
Man049_Woman054_0301,to keep the cushions in place and I'd
Man049_Woman054_0302,like to slight enough in the find which
Man049_Woman054_0303,they didn't used to do so I know why
Man049_Woman054_0304,they did it but it's yeah it's when
Man049_Woman054_0305,we're hanging out when we when we're
Man049_Woman054_0306,laughing we're sitting closer and we're
Man049_Woman054_0307,affectionate you just didn't really even
Man049_Woman054_0308,that kind of incidental capacity it's
Man049_Woman054_0309,like and a lot of ways I do you feel
Man049_Woman054_0310,that's one we're closest because it's
Man049_Woman054_0311,it's I feel like it's it's kind of that
Man049_Woman054_0312,harmony of of tenderness and levity that
Man049_Woman054_0313,I think is the product of being in a
Man049_Woman054_0314,relationship that's that's been going on
Man049_Woman054_0315,for a while that's kind of gotten past
Man049_Woman054_0316,sort of the inaugural discomforts and
Man049_Woman054_0317,but you know going back to boundaries to
Man049_Woman054_0318,like recognizing if there's still plenty
Man049_Woman054_0319,of arenas for a new discomfort and
Man049_Woman054_0320,trying to be respectful of that and work
Man049_Woman054_0321,around that but you know it's like

Man049_Woman054_0367,pretty pretty open yeah sometimes

Man049_Woman054_0369,me to turn away so I don't say yeah yeah
Man049_Woman054_0370,yeah there those slits well I'll tell
Man049_Woman054_0371,you there are a few things I'm certain
Man049_Woman054_0372,categories of things I'm still hesitant
Man049_Woman054_0373,to admit sometimes as you know I'm very
Man049_Woman054_0374,self-conscious about feeling like a
Man049_Woman054_0375,memory deficiencies you know it's
Man049_Woman054_0376,something that I'm half of its real half
Man049_Woman054_0377,of its just exacerbated by the suspicion
Man049_Woman054_0378,that it might be real and you know like
Man049_Woman054_0379,I'm figuring that stuff out but like
Man049_Woman054_0380,it's really hard for you that sometimes
Man049_Woman054_0381,that I've forgotten something which is
Man049_Woman054_0382,interesting because you don't care often
Man049_Woman054_0383,unless it's something of vital
Man049_Woman054_0384,importance the things that will
Man049_Woman054_0385,important seem to be what bugged me the
Man049_Woman054_0386,most I don't know why but it's it was
Man049_Woman054_0387,kind of tough for me and it's and I'm
Man049_Woman054_0388,not sure what you could do necessarily
Man049_Woman054_0389,heat it to make me not feel that way I'm
Man049_Woman054_0390,not sure what anyone could do I mean
Man049_Woman054_0391,it's really kind of between me and
Man049_Woman054_0392,myself but it's there are still things I
Man049_Woman054_0393,wish there was
Man049_Woman054_0394,well there is more I can do I can not
Man049_Woman054_0395,make you feel bad what you to forget
Man049_Woman054_0396,stuff especially when I forget to clean
Man049_Woman054_0397,the peanut butter off almond butter
Man049_Woman054_0398,knife I did this I think I got this
Man049_Woman054_0399,morning there right yeah but now I mean

Man049_Woman054_0401,me with that stuff my memory is not
Man049_Woman054_0402,perfect so your memories overrated
Man049_Woman054_0403,anyway
Man049_Woman054_0404,yeah well it's yeah it's we we use a
Man049_Woman054_0405,memory very broadly and referred it I
Man049_Woman054_0406,think a lot of different route to refer
Man049_Woman054_0407,to focused to refer to retention to
Man049_Woman054_0408,refer to as my side yeah nothing your
Man049_Woman054_0409,head tell me
Man049_Woman054_0410,[Music]
Man049_Woman054_0411,well I think I've I've had a hard time
Man049_Woman054_0412,getting out of the my cultural and
Man049_Woman054_0413,family thing of being polite not to hurt
Man049_Woman054_0414,feelings like I just think it's so
Man049_Woman054_0415,wonderful that he cook and you clean and
Man049_Woman054_0416,you're so wonderful around the house and
Man049_Woman054_0417,it was really hard for me to tell you
Man049_Woman054_0418,that I didn't like that one dish they
Man049_Woman054_0419,didn't move they're not very aware that
Man049_Woman054_0420,was I think it is use too much of the
Man049_Woman054_0421,olive oil in the pan because that's what
Man049_Woman054_0422,I hesitate to tell you and you actually
Man049_Woman054_0423,enjoy it

Man049_Woman054_0425,you're not supermen don't be cold I
Man049_Woman054_0426,write maybe but then that would also
Man049_Woman054_0427,mean there would be like Lex Luthor help
Man049_Woman054_0428,us other problems
Man049_Woman054_0429,yeah well challenges perfect I just knew
Man049_Woman054_0430,she had some infidelity
Man049_Woman054_0431,if you could change one thing in our
Man049_Woman054_0432,relationship what would it be and why
Man049_Woman054_0433,hmm that's a good I would have to say
Man049_Woman054_0434,[Music]
Man049_Woman054_0435,I think we each have our own challenges
Man049_Woman054_0436,that we're working through i'ma I
Man049_Woman054_0437,already talked about what some of mine
Man049_Woman054_0438,where memory and focus and I get
Man049_Woman054_0439,scattered and they have a hard time
Man049_Woman054_0440,managing my own times and sometimes I
Man049_Woman054_0441,mean your own challenges and that you
Man049_Woman054_0442,were working on I admire you for the
Man049_Woman054_0443,work that you're doing with it and I
Man049_Woman054_0444,just feel like we gets we're so worn out
Man049_Woman054_0445,by them sometimes yeah you know like it
Man049_Woman054_0446,is in the summer we have our adventures
Man049_Woman054_0447,and what are we every adventure is not
Man049_Woman054_0448,quite as many especially as closest and
Man049_Woman054_0449,lately but you know I just I just I
Man049_Woman054_0450,guess I look forward to the point where
Man049_Woman054_0451,we're we're both just feeling a little
Man049_Woman054_0452,bit more solid in ourselves which i
Man049_Woman054_0453,think is the quest of any any thinking
Man049_Woman054_0454,any compassionate any driven person out
Man049_Woman054_0455,there I look forward to a point where we
Man049_Woman054_0456,can or we can be that you know be in
Man049_Woman054_0457,that space and not just want to I should
Man049_Woman054_0458,speak for myself at least but not just
Man049_Woman054_0459,want to pass out sometimes you know like
Man049_Woman054_0460,you're a magnificent dancer a little bit
Man049_Woman054_0461,dance more often but I'm tired a lot
Man049_Woman054_0462,because of all that stuff but I'm
Man049_Woman054_0463,working through I was you know I'm sure
Man049_Woman054_0464,there are points for I know there are
Man049_Woman054_0465,points where you you feel like doing
Man049_Woman054_0466,something and and then the time comes
Man049_Woman054_0467,trying to do it and and you're tired I'd
Man049_Woman054_0468,like to get to a point where we're both
Man049_Woman054_0469,less tired and where we can dance I
Man049_Woman054_0470,don't know any dance
Man049_Woman054_0471,I think it's also a function of both of
Man049_Woman054_0472,us being really busy and you're working
Man049_Woman054_0473,too many hours I could be more efficient
Man049_Woman054_0474,we can take that Lachlan oh you didn't
Man049_Woman054_0475,who is more power in the relationship
Man049_Woman054_0476,very me I think we already answered that
Man049_Woman054_0477,this is a very feminist marriage so it
Man049_Woman054_0478,we don't want any kind of power play we
Man049_Woman054_0479,want to really egalitarian relationship
Man049_Woman054_0480,I think each one of us has more
Man049_Woman054_0481,knowledge and certain subjects that we
Man049_Woman054_0482,rely on each other for buy I would not
Man049_Woman054_0483,be in a comfortable I would not be
Man049_Woman054_0484,comfortable in a relationship or there
Man049_Woman054_0485,was a power imbalance yeah I agree I
Man049_Woman054_0486,think you have more power on the dance
Man049_Woman054_0487,floor you're a more arresting presence I
Man049_Woman054_0488,don't know I got dancing on my mind now
Man049_Woman054_0489,tell me about the time I disappointed
Man049_Woman054_0490,you and how do you feel about it now
Man049_Woman054_0491,yeah we already talked about how much
Man049_Woman054_0492,disappointed about how the enchilada
Man049_Woman054_0493,this turned out so I guess I had to get
Man049_Woman054_0494,it there I think it would be I don't
Man049_Woman054_0495,know if it would be you disappointing
Man049_Woman054_0496,again I think just in terms of outcomes
Man049_Woman054_0497,that we're disappointing I guess I go
Man049_Woman054_0498,back to our I'd go back to our main trip
Man049_Woman054_0499,11 that was such an amazing time seeing
Man049_Woman054_0500,that I gonna to interview the one the
Man049_Woman054_0501,last remaining shakers out there and you
Man049_Woman054_0502,were just again you really were very
Man049_Woman054_0503,interesting with that
Man049_Woman054_0504,in very commanding with that and I had
Man049_Woman054_0505,been letting them main driver and a rib
Man049_Woman054_0506,rage get to me and you know I was kind
Man049_Woman054_0507,of worn out and that that state and I
Man049_Woman054_0508,just remember there was a point where we
Man049_Woman054_0509,were ready I had to go into the
Man049_Woman054_0510,interview and we'd had an argument about
Man049_Woman054_0511,something that kind of built out of all
Man049_Woman054_0512,of that and I just for the reason it's
Man049_Woman054_0513,just let's just go in there and let's
Man049_Woman054_0514,just go in there and kind of get this
Man049_Woman054_0515,over with
Man049_Woman054_0516,and I don't know there's just one flight
Man049_Woman054_0517,whereas like I just I wish this this
Man049_Woman054_0518,moment hadn't turned out like that but
Man049_Woman054_0519,but I love about our relationship is and
Man049_Woman054_0520,you've kind of touched on this a little
Man049_Woman054_0521,bit I mean just the fact that we
Man049_Woman054_0522,communicate as well as we do I don't
Man049_Woman054_0523,know if you remember we had our
Man049_Woman054_0524,interview it went great
Man049_Woman054_0525,then we were back on the road and like
Man049_Woman054_0526,20 minutes later it was clear that we
Man049_Woman054_0527,both needed to talk it was an empty
Man049_Woman054_0528,country ready like pull over on the side
Man049_Woman054_0529,of the road and we talked it out and I
Man049_Woman054_0530,think that was that was one of the first
Man049_Woman054_0531,points where I really knew yes we can we
Man049_Woman054_0532,can experience disappointment but we can
Man049_Woman054_0533,we can build our way out of it because
Man049_Woman054_0534,we can talk and we can say you know this
Man049_Woman054_0535,I would not ideal what's that's how the
Man049_Woman054_0536,next hour the ideals and it was yeah we
Man049_Woman054_0537,saw a Punchbowl wonderful and I got to
Man049_Woman054_0538,hug a hemlock tree I got to say this is
Man049_Woman054_0539,what this is what I'm like you know this
Man049_Woman054_0540,is the forest of home look like it was a
Man049_Woman054_0541,beautiful beautiful evening and a very
Man049_Woman054_0542,long drive back to New York
Man049_Woman054_0543,do you plan on meeting with me for
Man049_Woman054_0544,everything just for one lifetime we can
Man049_Woman054_0545,start with that we've talked about this
Man049_Woman054_0546,to you I would rather I don't really
Man049_Woman054_0547,believe in reincarnation or rather I
Man049_Woman054_0548,don't want to believe in reincarnation
Man049_Woman054_0549,because I don't know if I want to go
Man049_Woman054_0550,through all of this again but I would do
Man049_Woman054_0551,it for you if it meant I could be with
Man049_Woman054_0552,you again oh that's easy
Man049_Woman054_0553,why don't you want children with me
Man049_Woman054_0554,[Laughter]
Man049_Woman054_0555,because children are great I love
Man049_Woman054_0556,children I love being around children
Man049_Woman054_0557,they're amazing but one of the things I
Man049_Woman054_0558,love most about children and my
Man049_Woman054_0559,relationship with children is when I am
Man049_Woman054_0560,done with them at the end of the day I
Man049_Woman054_0561,can give them back to the people who
Man049_Woman054_0562,have to put them to bed or feed them or
Man049_Woman054_0563,any number of things which I happily
Man049_Woman054_0564,have not put on my agenda and I know
Man049_Woman054_0565,that you feel the same way even use the
Man049_Woman054_0566,same words I think we would have great
Man049_Woman054_0567,kids I think we would contribute to the
Man049_Woman054_0568,feminist community and what I think
Man049_Woman054_0569,would be a fairly attractive manner I
Man049_Woman054_0570,hope they would inherit my sense of
Man049_Woman054_0571,humor but yeah I think we both like in
Man049_Woman054_0572,what was it it was it was the term again
Man049_Woman054_0573,yeah yeah right
Man049_Woman054_0574,part-time part-time yeah professional

Man049_Woman054_0576,kids professional aunt no kids yes I
Man049_Woman054_0577,love that
Man049_Woman054_0578,and less of the carbon footprint also
Man049_Woman054_0579,but I digress okay the answer is yes
Man049_Woman054_0580,right am I the best sex you've ever had
Man049_Woman054_0581,I think for my family's sake we're gonna
Man049_Woman054_0582,pass on that one for my family safety
Man049_Woman054_0583,yes no yes was the answer the question
Man049_Woman054_0584,not the oh I know I know the answer to
Man049_Woman054_0585,this also do we have enough sex do we
Man049_Woman054_0586,have enough sex no what's the hardest
Man049_Woman054_0587,thing about a relationship not enough
Man049_Woman054_0588,time together I miss you so much when
Man049_Woman054_0589,we're at work and I miss you when you
Man049_Woman054_0590,work so many hours and I wish we were
Man049_Woman054_0591,like independently wealthy so all we
Man049_Woman054_0592,could do is just travel around the world
Man049_Woman054_0593,together how have I changed since we
Man049_Woman054_0594,first met
Man049_Woman054_0595,what do you miss about me what do I miss
Man049_Woman054_0596,about you I don't know that I missed
Man049_Woman054_0597,anything about you I think what I miss
Man049_Woman054_0598,are some of the things I know that you
Man049_Woman054_0599,had in your life at the time I don't
Man049_Woman054_0600,think it changed as a consequence of
Man049_Woman054_0601,being with me but you know no you were
Man049_Woman054_0602,you had school you had the Women's
Man049_Woman054_0603,Rights Coalition and that was something
Man049_Woman054_0604,that was very meaningful for you and
Man049_Woman054_0605,Richie and inspiring and I guess I worry
Man049_Woman054_0606,sometimes that there's not enough of
Man049_Woman054_0607,that for you
Man049_Woman054_0608,the dog shows and you love that and but
Man049_Woman054_0609,I guess just were you with that what's
Man049_Woman054_0610,been happening with now lately and but
Man049_Woman054_0611,what's been happening lately with the
Man049_Woman054_0612,circles that you know one time we're
Man049_Woman054_0613,inspiring for you kind of now become in
Man049_Woman054_0614,a source of anxiety and and happiness
Man049_Woman054_0615,like I just died I miss what I would I
Man049_Woman054_0616,what exhale ease perceived as being the
Man049_Woman054_0617,case at the time which was just more
Man049_Woman054_0618,things that I guess there's more things
Man049_Woman054_0619,that maybe you maybe you happy other
Man049_Woman054_0620,than what I could give other than what I
Man049_Woman054_0621,could contribute directly but leaving
Man049_Woman054_0622,that aside I wish there was more just in
Man049_Woman054_0623,your life really happy with the chapter
Man049_Woman054_0624,I think it's hard once you leave college
Man049_Woman054_0625,because in college you have this like
Man049_Woman054_0626,you know available base of people you
Man049_Woman054_0627,can just hang out with I think once you
Man049_Woman054_0628,enter once you leave that there's just
Man049_Woman054_0629,not like these dozens of people you're
Man049_Woman054_0630,surrounded with that you can just find
Man049_Woman054_0631,commonality Wed
Man049_Woman054_0632,have a club with I think it's just hard
Man049_Woman054_0633,yeah what is our biggest challenges a
Man049_Woman054_0634,couple you can't see us that we don't
Man049_Woman054_0635,have that time together actually really
Man049_Woman054_0636,happy and personally I would love to
Man049_Woman054_0637,have more money and you know my dream of
Man049_Woman054_0638,I buying a house and having my mom lived
Man049_Woman054_0639,there and having your mom live there and
Man049_Woman054_0640,so Hannah could come and visit us I
Man049_Woman054_0641,love if you could see her family more
Man049_Woman054_0642,often
Man049_Woman054_0643,and I could see them more often - so
Man049_Woman054_0644,it's the fundamental problem that the
Man049_Woman054_0645,scope for the glib that's our biggest

Man049_Woman054_0651,anything that I love and anything that I
Man049_Woman054_0652,value being temporary just being
Man049_Woman054_0653,inherently temporary I don't know why
Man049_Woman054_0654,that is I like I was raised in abundance
Man049_Woman054_0655,in in in some respects not the
Man049_Woman054_0656,wealthiest family to speak of it but
Man049_Woman054_0657,certainly abundance in terms of love and
Man049_Woman054_0658,compassion and support and I'm happy
Man049_Woman054_0659,with the job that I have and I really
Man049_Woman054_0660,haven't suffered too many too much in
Man049_Woman054_0661,the way of bitter disappointments I not

Man049_Woman054_0672,that I would wake up in the world would
Man049_Woman054_0673,be covered in water and I don't know if
Man049_Woman054_0674,that's part of it but but I do always
