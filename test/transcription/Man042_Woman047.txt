Man042_Woman047_0060,everybody could tolerate us crazy when
Man042_Woman047_0061,do you feel when do you feel the closest
Man042_Woman047_0062,to me I always feel close to you even
Man042_Woman047_0063,when we're not together like even when
Man042_Woman047_0064,you're away on business or I guess I
Man042_Woman047_0065,feel the closest to you when we're in
Man042_Woman047_0066,your house and both cats are there
Man042_Woman047_0067,because you know traveling with Miko you
Man042_Woman047_0068,know and just sometimes not even talking
Man042_Woman047_0069,it's like being on the sectional you
Man042_Woman047_0070,know pajamas you know like sometimes
Man042_Woman047_0071,falling asleep during a movie on TV or
Man042_Woman047_0072,something no no it's it's always there

Man042_Woman047_0082,that there will be distance but you'll
Man042_Woman047_0083,feel more distant from me when I think I
Man042_Woman047_0084,do feel closer to you every time we
Man042_Woman047_0085,fight I would say my favourite point of
Man042_Woman047_0086,of being close to you is you know when

Man042_Woman047_0130,and that there may be how I feel about
Man042_Woman047_0131,my transition today might not be the way
Man042_Woman047_0132,I feel about tomorrow and I'm hesitant
Man042_Woman047_0133,to tell you when I'm scared and
Man042_Woman047_0134,sometimes it might be scared to tell you
Man042_Woman047_0135,something

Man042_Woman047_0140,let them sit inside of me and eat away
Man042_Woman047_0141,at me I have to get it out and just deal
Man042_Woman047_0142,with the reaction so I feel safe talking
Man042_Woman047_0143,to you about anything
Man042_Woman047_0144,I wonder if hesitant falls into the same
Man042_Woman047_0145,category of you know what you're afraid
Man042_Woman047_0146,of or what you'll hold back you know I'm
Man042_Woman047_0147,saying has it in as a if that's asked in
Man042_Woman047_0148,different ways one might be different
Man042_Woman047_0149,conversation or you think who cooks it I
Man042_Woman047_0150,pick this one yeah good first I picked
Man042_Woman047_0151,you pick now I think this mmm Oh tell me
Man042_Woman047_0152,about the time I disappointed you
Man042_Woman047_0153,and how did you feel about it now and
Man042_Woman047_0154,how do you feel about it now
Man042_Woman047_0155,I can't really say that you truly have
Man042_Woman047_0156,ever disappointed me to the point that I
Man042_Woman047_0157,was like devastated you know I think
Man042_Woman047_0158,I've asked you not to say certain things
Man042_Woman047_0159,and when you say them I feel a little
Man042_Woman047_0160,disappointed but I tell you it's not
Man042_Woman047_0161,like I'm gone
Man042_Woman047_0162,oh he said that again you know like you
Man042_Woman047_0163,know like when we argue sometimes you'll
Man042_Woman047_0164,allude to bailing instead of just
Man042_Woman047_0165,reacting just go through this and know
Man042_Woman047_0166,we're gonna get past it together you
Man042_Woman047_0167,know and so I guess that's really the
Man042_Woman047_0168,only thing but it's not really a
Man042_Woman047_0169,disappointment

Man042_Woman047_0175,thought that you were disappointing me
Man042_Woman047_0176,but then when I answer the part about
Man042_Woman047_0177,how I feel about it now I realize it's
Man042_Woman047_0178,kind of like you didn't disappoint me I
Man042_Woman047_0179,disappoint myself because I have this
Man042_Woman047_0180,way of how it should be or something
Man042_Woman047_0181,that I'm taken from another relationship
Man042_Woman047_0182,of putting on you so I've just I would
Man042_Woman047_0183,have to say I don't I don't think you've

Man042_Woman047_0194,on together to make well the the
Man042_Woman047_0195,promises that we've made to each other

Man042_Woman047_0211,fail you Kat well we've had recent
Man042_Woman047_0212,conversations heated conversations about
Man042_Woman047_0213,things and sometimes we're on different
Man042_Woman047_0214,pages or different levels or being
Man042_Woman047_0215,patient being impatient with different
Man042_Woman047_0216,things you know like I think we both
Man042_Woman047_0217,have fear about being in limbo with
Man042_Woman047_0218,different things and and if thing was
Man042_Woman047_0219,all gonna be the way they are and just
Man042_Woman047_0220,stay that way then I think we need to be

Man042_Woman047_0229,relationships like you said that
Man042_Woman047_0230,recently about your past relationships
Man042_Woman047_0231,when I say like old tapes or something
Man042_Woman047_0232,just the way things played out the way
Man042_Woman047_0233,people transition the way
Man042_Woman047_0234,do things you know and so I have fear
Man042_Woman047_0235,that sometimes it's not gonna happen or
Man042_Woman047_0236,I'm gonna get impatient but even if it
Man042_Woman047_0237,doesn't happen I still want to be with
Man042_Woman047_0238,you and you should know that you know
Man042_Woman047_0239,whatever reasons you have you know that
Man042_Woman047_0240,failure is no option for me anyway so

Man042_Woman047_0246,take me for granted so what do you think
Man042_Woman047_0247,like you know why what is taking
Man042_Woman047_0248,somebody for granted and relationship
Man042_Woman047_0249,expectations like um if somebody doesn't
Man042_Woman047_0250,do something and they normally doing
Man042_Woman047_0251,something the other person's I go you
Man042_Woman047_0252,didn't do this or you let me down you
Man042_Woman047_0253,usually do this now why aren't you doing
Man042_Woman047_0254,this now or mind-reading you know you
Man042_Woman047_0255,should have known this I expected you
Man042_Woman047_0256,you know if you really knew me you would
Man042_Woman047_0257,have known that we don't do that with
Man042_Woman047_0258,each other okay that's me how do I feel
Man042_Woman047_0259,I take you for granted
Man042_Woman047_0260,I think it's all the stuff that I that I
Man042_Woman047_0261,do because I love you
Man042_Woman047_0262,and then I put on you crannis what
Man042_Woman047_0263,should we just which I just it's a
Man042_Woman047_0264,couple days ago but sometimes you'll say
Man042_Woman047_0265,that I do and I do and I do and I'll say
Man042_Woman047_0266,stop with the martyr thing yeah and then
Man042_Woman047_0267,it starts an argument I was like if you
Man042_Woman047_0268,don't want to do it just say it
Man042_Woman047_0269,yeah just say it I do want to do it but
Man042_Woman047_0270,I think I you know what this is like
Man042_Woman047_0271,this is like what I hear my parents and
Man042_Woman047_0272,I mean this is what I hear since I was a
Man042_Woman047_0273,kid my mother the one thing where I saw
Man042_Woman047_0274,my grandmother's do I don't know about
Man042_Woman047_0275,you your grandparents I saw my mother do
Man042_Woman047_0276,stuff for my father or for us and then
Man042_Woman047_0277,feel she was being taken for granted but
Man042_Woman047_0278,I never saw that when my grandmother's
Man042_Woman047_0279,what my grandfathers and us you mean my
Man042_Woman047_0280,mother does that to to the grandkids you
Man042_Woman047_0281,know I'm saying do it don't like you
Man042_Woman047_0282,know I'm bitch about it
Man042_Woman047_0283,mm-hm did I guess that first what would
Man042_Woman047_0284,you do if I cheated on you like never
Man042_Woman047_0285,mess with a nurse I know what you're
Man042_Woman047_0286,allergic to
Man042_Woman047_0287,no I would just leave you know because I
Man042_Woman047_0288,I get the way I am the person that I'm
Man042_Woman047_0289,with is mine and if somebody else has
Man042_Woman047_0290,been there I get turned off I get
Man042_Woman047_0291,disgusted and I would just shut down and
Man042_Woman047_0292,so I mean eventually in time we could be
Man042_Woman047_0293,somewhat friendly you know I've always
Man042_Woman047_0294,loved in the past this ever happened
Man042_Woman047_0295,before in the past I was cheating on
Man042_Woman047_0296,once in the past and I left Laurie
Man042_Woman047_0297,that's right away well I had a fire in
Man042_Woman047_0298,apartment but it was within a month of
Man042_Woman047_0299,her cheating yeah that's me
Man042_Woman047_0300,what would you do if I cheated on you I
Man042_Woman047_0301,agree
Man042_Woman047_0302,everything would die you know when
Man042_Woman047_0303,somebody was like touching her hair you
Man042_Woman047_0304,know you were touching them in ways you
Man042_Woman047_0305,touch me or don't but would you go you'd
Man042_Woman047_0306,be dead to me you'd be dead to me I
Man042_Woman047_0307,might be gone what is missing from our
Man042_Woman047_0308,relationship
Man042_Woman047_0309,I think I you think I'm going to answer
Man042_Woman047_0310,this one particular way that you would
Man042_Woman047_0311,like me to take a pass what again no no
Man042_Woman047_0312,really I could really answer it but you
Man042_Woman047_0313,know you can't said oh yes I will be
Man042_Woman047_0314,sensitive I would like us to be a little
Man042_Woman047_0315,bit more intimate but I wanted to say
Man042_Woman047_0316,that the intimacy or the frequency of
Man042_Woman047_0317,the of the intimacy is what I feel is
Man042_Woman047_0318,missing from our relationship I think
Man042_Woman047_0319,it's the talking about it and working
Man042_Woman047_0320,through it together is what's missing
Man042_Woman047_0321,from our relationship like so soon what

Man042_Woman047_0334,their reactions and my family has always
Man042_Woman047_0335,been very accepting exceptionally

Man042_Woman047_0469,not the word failed what is it it's
Man042_Woman047_0470,about you know people being on different

Man042_Woman047_0542,listen to us to talk about it okay but
Man042_Woman047_0543,in the back of my mind it's not that
Man042_Woman047_0544,it's not that in the back of my mind
Man042_Woman047_0545,like what if what if you met somebody
Man042_Woman047_0546,that was I don't know just turned your
Man042_Woman047_0547,head like how are you wonder how is it

Man042_Woman047_0557,you know might have more money than me
Man042_Woman047_0558,you know might not have all this hanging
Man042_Woman047_0559,skin that I do can turn your head and
Man042_Woman047_0560,you would walk away I could tell you
Man042_Woman047_0561,know you're gonna believe what you want
Man042_Woman047_0562,to believe you know and I can tell you
Man042_Woman047_0563,know and I can reassure you but if you
Man042_Woman047_0564,have that thing in your head I don't
Man042_Woman047_0565,know how you feel like that because then
Man042_Woman047_0566,it's like
Man042_Woman047_0567,every day of relationship you feel like
Man042_Woman047_0568,you know feel secure know the back of my
Man042_Woman047_0569,mind okay the back of my mind they used
Man042_Woman047_0570,to be in the front of my mind which led
Man042_Woman047_0571,to Howie right yeah used to be in the
Man042_Woman047_0572,front of my mind it's not it's in the
Man042_Woman047_0573,way way way back hopefully you know no
Man042_Woman047_0574,go you go who would struggle more if we
Man042_Woman047_0575,broke up you realize how these questions
Man042_Woman047_0576,are pretty much what we talk about you
Man042_Woman047_0577,get this recently too
Man042_Woman047_0578,I know it will be I miss kitty cat
Man042_Woman047_0579,though you know I throw this out and say
Man042_Woman047_0580,that you'd be on the floor under that
Man042_Woman047_0581,said that he'd be on the floor
Man042_Woman047_0582,that's it would be me
Man042_Woman047_0583,who would struggle more if we broke up I
Man042_Woman047_0584,think we would both have struggles
Man042_Woman047_0585,different struggles I think I might seem
Man042_Woman047_0586,okay on the outside you know because of
Man042_Woman047_0587,that uh keeping myself busy going and
Man042_Woman047_0588,going and going thing that I would do
Man042_Woman047_0589,but I would have internal struggle for
Man042_Woman047_0590,sure
Man042_Woman047_0591,never let them see you sweat right who
Man042_Woman047_0592,has more power in the relationship you
Man042_Woman047_0593,were made well I was just told a few
Man042_Woman047_0594,minutes ago that I was the puppet master
Man042_Woman047_0595,which is not the case the case and you
Man042_Woman047_0596,know sometimes you tell me that I
Man042_Woman047_0597,micromanage you and well I think that
Man042_Woman047_0598,runs in my family with the women and it
Man042_Woman047_0599,comes off as nagging and I can see it I
Man042_Woman047_0600,can see it when it's happening but like
Man042_Woman047_0601,I have to say things like it's their
Man042_Woman047_0602,suggestions that's all it's its
Man042_Woman047_0603,suggestions and what do you take them or
Man042_Woman047_0604,leave them I have to say them I know
Man042_Woman047_0605,like you don't even want to hear
Man042_Woman047_0606,anything you just want to do it your way
Man042_Woman047_0607,you know I think I think my family and
Man042_Woman047_0608,friends that I don't have anymore I
Man042_Woman047_0609,think you have all the power like your
Man042_Woman047_0610,Yoko Ono and I'm you know John Lennon no
Man042_Woman047_0611,it's true like I'm like a little how
Man042_Woman047_0612,much you can't guess what I'm saying
Man042_Woman047_0613,that people say people think that there
Man042_Woman047_0614,should be power in the relationship that
Man042_Woman047_0615,I'm weak that I'm like this old fat
Man042_Woman047_0616,lesbo who now thinks they're transgender
Man042_Woman047_0617,and that you're coming and you know
Man042_Woman047_0618,putting that in my head
Man042_Woman047_0619,that other what you know mean yeah
Man042_Woman047_0620,that's what it when I think of power
Man042_Woman047_0621,well I think but really when you when
Man042_Woman047_0622,you put everything to decide we would
Man042_Woman047_0623,think that one should be more power ful
Man042_Woman047_0624,in a relationship no I think it should
Man042_Woman047_0625,be equal I mean I I think of you know
Man042_Woman047_0626,you feel the other person has the upper
Man042_Woman047_0627,hand then you're not gonna grow together
Man042_Woman047_0628,you're not gonna grow separately and
Man042_Woman047_0629,you're not gonna grow together I think
Man042_Woman047_0630,that a lot of resentments
Man042_Woman047_0631,hmm would build up and come out in all
Man042_Woman047_0632,different ways yeah absolutely right
Man042_Woman047_0633,absolutely right
Man042_Woman047_0634,ask me who has more power in a
Man042_Woman047_0635,relationship you were me I don't think
Man042_Woman047_0636,either one of us has more power but I
Man042_Woman047_0637,think that when I first came to this
Man042_Woman047_0638,relationship power and a relationship
Man042_Woman047_0639,over a woman was important to me as the
Man042_Woman047_0640,man I must be honest you know I love you

Man042_Woman047_0691,different things you know we've been
Man042_Woman047_0692,going through a lot with the situation
Man042_Woman047_0693,with my mom's health a lot and it's
Man042_Woman047_0694,taking a toll on us you know and we can
Man042_Woman047_0695,both be clinical people you know you're
Man042_Woman047_0696,in food service and I'm a nurse but it's
Man042_Woman047_0697,somebody we love and it's hard you know
Man042_Woman047_0698,and but we've bonded together and it's
Man042_Woman047_0699,still going on there's still more
Man042_Woman047_0700,adventures waiting for that to happen
Man042_Woman047_0701,and that's the way we look at it it's
Man042_Woman047_0702,not like drudgery Oh what's the next
Man042_Woman047_0703,step
Man042_Woman047_0704,where is the next placement you know
Man042_Woman047_0705,we're doing it together
Man042_Woman047_0706,and I don't know if you've ever had that
Man042_Woman047_0707,with somebody you know but it really I
Man042_Woman047_0708,think you've come you've changed in a
Man042_Woman047_0709,lot of different ways a lot of different
Man042_Woman047_0710,ways
Man042_Woman047_0711,um for the better I'm glad to hear you
Man042_Woman047_0712,say that cuz you know sometimes I don't
Man042_Woman047_0713,know if you see the difference I see the
Man042_Woman047_0714,difference in myself you know no longer
Man042_Woman047_0715,a reviewed as a bitch you know like you
Man042_Woman047_0716,say at work you know you want me to come
Man042_Woman047_0717,out at work and you want me to and
Man042_Woman047_0718,that's going to come but I think
Man042_Woman047_0719,everything is a transition I think that
Man042_Woman047_0720,in the best circumstances every
Man042_Woman047_0721,relationship her transgender guy is
Man042_Woman047_0722,gonna be you know for his relationships
Man042_Woman047_0723,with his friends his work and you want
Man042_Woman047_0724,to be you know careful with them and and
Man042_Woman047_0725,sometimes takes a long time I think in
Man042_Woman047_0726,the business world you have to be a
Man042_Woman047_0727,little bit more professional with it
Man042_Woman047_0728,that I'm no longer the fact that I'm no
Man042_Woman047_0729,longer viewed as a bitch and and male
Man042_Woman047_0730,what women pronouns in feedback I get
Man042_Woman047_0731,from my direct reports and people have
Man042_Woman047_0732,gone you know to while they describe me
Man042_Woman047_0733,now and yeah I you know thank you for
Man042_Woman047_0734,saying that difference in me what do you
Man042_Woman047_0735,miss about me the old you thought I
Man042_Woman047_0736,wonder well that's interesting how have
Man042_Woman047_0737,I changed since we first met and what do
Man042_Woman047_0738,you miss about me hmm
Man042_Woman047_0739,I guess if this was a negative change
Man042_Woman047_0740,you know you see you take that well I
Man042_Woman047_0741,could say something well you know you
Man042_Woman047_0742,still have the ability to show emotion
Man042_Woman047_0743,and get teary and cry yeah and I love
Man042_Woman047_0744,that and we've talked about how that
Man042_Woman047_0745,female energy that's deep inside of you
Man042_Woman047_0746,alone allows that I mean there are
Man042_Woman047_0747,sensitive men
Man042_Woman047_0748,okay but you know and I've told you that
Man042_Woman047_0749,people have been with once they start
Man042_Woman047_0750,testosterone they lose that ability to
Man042_Woman047_0751,cry and the road rage I've seen and the
Man042_Woman047_0752,change with that surging through their
Man042_Woman047_0753,blood like yes they have facial hair and
Man042_Woman047_0754,their voice drops
Man042_Woman047_0755,well then once I've doing me what do you
Man042_Woman047_0756,miss about the old mate well the old you
Man042_Woman047_0757,is that it's still there that you still
Man042_Woman047_0758,are sensitive
Man042_Woman047_0759,and can cry so I don't really miss it
Man042_Woman047_0760,but if you went on TV I wouldn't miss it
Man042_Woman047_0761,so I'm kind of projecting no kind of
Man042_Woman047_0762,future so then yeah obviously the old
Man042_Woman047_0763,way I was I didn't lose anything that
Man042_Woman047_0764,was I took everything that was good how
Man042_Woman047_0765,have I changed since we first met
Man042_Woman047_0766,you have changed somebody tell you
Man042_Woman047_0767,something
Man042_Woman047_0768,you have changed tremendously you were
Man042_Woman047_0769,like I know you're gonna say because I'm
Man042_Woman047_0770,using your words but I don't know how
Man042_Woman047_0771,you could say use new words and not want
Man042_Woman047_0772,me to say them back but anyway I think
Man042_Woman047_0773,you were very sealed over I think that
Man042_Woman047_0774,you when we first met you know and
Man042_Woman047_0775,you're you told me that was just a
Man042_Woman047_0776,networking meeting yet sometimes you'll
Man042_Woman047_0777,throw it out there that I went on and
Man042_Woman047_0778,dated others before we went on our
Man042_Woman047_0779,second interaction but you were very
Man042_Woman047_0780,sealed over you're coming out of a long
Man042_Woman047_0781,five-year relationship that you would
Man042_Woman047_0782,obviously settled on and I see you
Man042_Woman047_0783,coming to you're coming to your own I
Man042_Woman047_0784,know it makes you tick
Man042_Woman047_0785,you know and it's nice to see you coming
Man042_Woman047_0786,to your own like I say to you you should
Man042_Woman047_0787,be taking time for yourself you should
Man042_Woman047_0788,be you I mean and I want you to have
Man042_Woman047_0789,time to yourself so you have changed you
Man042_Woman047_0790,know not as rigid you know the things
Man042_Woman047_0791,should be displayed like you know you've
Man042_Woman047_0792,changed a lot
Man042_Woman047_0793,you know you've let a lot of walls come
Man042_Woman047_0794,down I think that's good to hear I mean
Man042_Woman047_0795,I definitely feel that that's a second
Man042_Woman047_0796,floor what do you miss about me
Man042_Woman047_0797,you know that you stayed that person
Man042_Woman047_0798,gotten this far and the final question
Man042_Woman047_0799,will you marry me miss know if you could
Man042_Woman047_0800,change one thing in our relationship
Man042_Woman047_0801,what would it be and why think
Man042_Woman047_0802,mm sometimes I feel the different
Man042_Woman047_0803,reasons I depend on you for things
Man042_Woman047_0804,because I don't drive and living in
Man042_Woman047_0805,suburbia
Man042_Woman047_0806,mm-hm like how do you live out here and
Man042_Woman047_0807,not drive mm-hmm and so sometimes you
Man042_Woman047_0808,know I imagine myself in a little smart
Man042_Woman047_0809,car you know or something but I guess I
Man042_Woman047_0810,would try to be you know cuz I have
Man042_Woman047_0811,Fiero driving if I could get over that I
Man042_Woman047_0812,think that would balance our
Man042_Woman047_0813,relationship more you know it would be
Man042_Woman047_0814,less sometimes it feels like pressure I
Man042_Woman047_0815,think for you I know you enjoy driving
Man042_Woman047_0816,and everything but so in our
Man042_Woman047_0817,relationship because the the things we
Man042_Woman047_0818,do together because I have the wheels
Man042_Woman047_0819,and you don't you would change that in
Man042_Woman047_0820,our relationship I guess some deeper
Man042_Woman047_0821,than that deeper what would I change I
Man042_Woman047_0822,think sometimes well I think sometimes
Man042_Woman047_0823,when we argue like you say we get wild
Man042_Woman047_0824,or I get wild like a wild cat you know
Man042_Woman047_0825,and it's like yeah you know I'd like to
Man042_Woman047_0826,not get to that point and I think it
Man042_Woman047_0827,hasn't gotten to that point every time
Man042_Woman047_0828,you know I don't like that it's not good
Man042_Woman047_0829,for me I say it's not good for my beauty
Man042_Woman047_0830,you know but I mean I get like you know
Man042_Woman047_0831,the hair gets big and then I get all
Man042_Woman047_0832,Italian and that yeah you know it's like
Man042_Woman047_0833,yeah a nice thought just to see black
Man042_Woman047_0834,like if something said something you
Man042_Woman047_0835,often you know I would just see the
Man042_Woman047_0836,color black and now I'm not really
Man042_Woman047_0837,seeing that anymore I'm able to say am I
Man042_Woman047_0838,gonna go there with this how important
Man042_Woman047_0839,is it and maybe I shouldn't say anything
Man042_Woman047_0840,let's talk about this later so I think
Man042_Woman047_0841,things have changed in our relationship
Man042_Woman047_0842,but concretely what I would like to
Man042_Woman047_0843,bring to the table that I don't bring is
Man042_Woman047_0844,the ability to drive
Man042_Woman047_0845,okay we think we can do that we can get
Man042_Woman047_0846,you know that's a scary idea right you
Man042_Woman047_0847,asked me if you could change one thing
Man042_Woman047_0848,in our relationship what would it be and
Man042_Woman047_0849,why
Man042_Woman047_0850,you know I agree with that but it's
Man042_Woman047_0851,forcing me to go a little a little bit
Man042_Woman047_0852,deeper
Man042_Woman047_0853,sometimes I think biologically you know
Man042_Woman047_0854,I wish my physical part was different so
Man042_Woman047_0855,our relationship could be fully you know
Man042_Woman047_0856,like a man and a woman like a biology
Man042_Woman047_0857,but biological man and a woman but I
Man042_Woman047_0858,think we could figure that out I
Man042_Woman047_0859,struggle with that I think sometimes I
Man042_Woman047_0860,don't think people get that when you're
Man042_Woman047_0861,in the born in the wrong body like I see
Man042_Woman047_0862,sex and executing it a certain way
Man042_Woman047_0863,I want our communication to be better
Man042_Woman047_0864,but I want us to be so like shells you
Man042_Woman047_0865,know I want I want to feel so close to
Man042_Woman047_0866,you I want you to be like having my back
Man042_Woman047_0867,at all times and and never leave me and
Man042_Woman047_0868,you know I think that but you don't
Man042_Woman047_0869,think that like I do have you I didn't
Man042_Woman047_0870,put it I know I just want to if I could
Man042_Woman047_0871,change I don't know I guess that's not
Man042_Woman047_0872,really answering it you know one thing
Man042_Woman047_0873,in our relationship that I would change
Man042_Woman047_0874,I just you know just our communication
Man042_Woman047_0875,needs to be better I wouldn't change
Man042_Woman047_0876,anything about you and and I'd like to
Man042_Woman047_0877,change maybe a little bit more of our
Man042_Woman047_0878,living before we take that step to be a
Man042_Woman047_0879,little bit more together than just the
Man042_Woman047_0880,weekends I'd like to see that I'd like
Man042_Woman047_0881,to change that a little bit more I'd
Man042_Woman047_0882,like to be with you more during the week
Man042_Woman047_0883,than just this weekend thing
Man042_Woman047_0884,like to live together with you a little
Man042_Woman047_0885,bit more well that was good all right
Man042_Woman047_0886,yeah
Man042_Woman047_0887,a question that just like you wish was
Man042_Woman047_0888,in Iowa
