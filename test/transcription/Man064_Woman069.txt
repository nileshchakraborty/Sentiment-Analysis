Man064_Woman069_0001,as it turns out I was sick and the jello
Man064_Woman069_0002,didn't set anyway fruit in it and I
Man064_Woman069_0003,didn't know that you have to like drive
Man064_Woman069_0004,the fruit before you make fruit jello
Man064_Woman069_0005,it's good you didn't show up it was bad
Man064_Woman069_0006,there was one of the first things we
Man064_Woman069_0007,discuss you know it's good that you
Man064_Woman069_0008,didn't come because the jello is gross
Man064_Woman069_0009,she's so cute and such a mess hey can
Man064_Woman069_0010,you hand me a card when was the moment
Man064_Woman069_0011,you knew you loved me I think it was a
Man064_Woman069_0012,gradual thing since we were both in kind
Man064_Woman069_0013,of a messy place and you ended up going
Man064_Woman069_0014,abroad you know we were just talking on
Man064_Woman069_0015,instant messenger with a faulty
Man064_Woman069_0016,connection and I think it took a lot of
Man064_Woman069_0017,time to soak in I think it actually
Man064_Woman069_0018,ended up being really good for it mm-hmm
Man064_Woman069_0019,I don't think there was a single like a
Man064_Woman069_0020,sudden moment when I was like right now
Man064_Woman069_0021,I was a growing thing yeah I think when
Man064_Woman069_0022,I went abroad to Peru I was gone for
Man064_Woman069_0023,three weeks I was so sad I don't know if
Man064_Woman069_0024,I would have said I loved you at that
Man064_Woman069_0025,point but I think I felt it
Man064_Woman069_0026,what are your three favorite memories
Man064_Woman069_0027,that we've shared hmm Quito fest that
Man064_Woman069_0028,was hysterical and that'll show on top
Man064_Woman069_0029,of a mountain in Latin America that was
Man064_Woman069_0030,great chances our first date I thought
Man064_Woman069_0031,it was a really sweet date with the
Man064_Woman069_0032,strawberry strawberry lemonade martinis
Man064_Woman069_0033,and pretzel sandwiches by the creek
Man064_Woman069_0034,heavy movie I thought that was really
Man064_Woman069_0035,beautiful
Man064_Woman069_0036,I mean maybe Oh our wedding night when
Man064_Woman069_0037,we went back to the hotel and sat in our
Man064_Woman069_0038,underwear and counted money that was
Man064_Woman069_0039,really fun
Man064_Woman069_0040,yeah I'm just counting money in my
Man064_Woman069_0041,underwear one of those things yeah and
Man064_Woman069_0042,that's not what you know it was awesome
Man064_Woman069_0043,that was great you hand me a card when
Man064_Woman069_0044,do you feel closest to me people around
Man064_Woman069_0045,which is great or that makes sense I is
Man064_Woman069_0046,that weird on camera I have a bottle I
Man064_Woman069_0047,can bottle feed him
Man064_Woman069_0048,you
Man064_Woman069_0049,where do you hasn't hidden to tell me
Man064_Woman069_0050,I don't hesitate to tell you much I
Man064_Woman069_0051,hesitate to tell you kind of smaller
Man064_Woman069_0052,things like I'm gonna be late because
Man064_Woman069_0053,I'll be upset about it I mean in this in
Man064_Woman069_0054,this moment I I don't think I'm a I'm
Man064_Woman069_0055,hesitant to tell you anything maybe I
Man064_Woman069_0056,guess I'm hesitant sometimes to talk
Man064_Woman069_0057,about to ask you for help I'm hesitant
Man064_Woman069_0058,to do that because I don't want to seem
Man064_Woman069_0059,like I need help with him but I do and
Man064_Woman069_0060,because you're working and I'm not I
Man064_Woman069_0061,feel like I should this is the way that
Man064_Woman069_0062,I contribute so it's more like asking I
Man064_Woman069_0063,think more hesitant to do than telling I
Man064_Woman069_0064,mean yeah it's hard when I'm working but
Man064_Woman069_0065,yeah
Man064_Woman069_0066,and sometimes when I ask you to help
Man064_Woman069_0067,with him you seem like you don't want to
Man064_Woman069_0068,I'm not that's challenging for me and I
Man064_Woman069_0069,think that's where that comes from
Man064_Woman069_0070,do you feel that way like you you resist
Man064_Woman069_0071,your resistance to I think most of the
Man064_Woman069_0072,time I don't know what to do yeah I'm
Man064_Woman069_0073,not sure what's what he needs
Man064_Woman069_0074,we're learning together first time for
Man064_Woman069_0075,everything right what's the greatest
Man064_Woman069_0076,lesson I taught you learned a lot from
Man064_Woman069_0077,each other but it's hard to pinpoint I
Man064_Woman069_0078,think you were one of the first people
Man064_Woman069_0079,that really believed in the things I
Man064_Woman069_0080,wanted to do I had a lot of voices in my
Man064_Woman069_0081,life saying that you know going going
Man064_Woman069_0082,create interaction with my career didn't
Man064_Woman069_0083,make a whole lot of sense
Man064_Woman069_0084,financially and I would support a family
Man064_Woman069_0085,I think there are some voices they gave
Man064_Woman069_0086,me fear on that and I think you were one
Man064_Woman069_0087,of the first people to say not only is
Man064_Woman069_0088,that like interesting and fun but go for
Man064_Woman069_0089,it and do it I thank you I think you
Man064_Woman069_0090,constantly remind me how to be curious
Man064_Woman069_0091,and ask questions and be adventurous I
Man064_Woman069_0092,think I would tend to to stop myself
Man064_Woman069_0093,from those experiences if it weren't for
Man064_Woman069_0094,you
Man064_Woman069_0095,I like that reputation you really help
Man064_Woman069_0096,me to be more childlike and not in a bad
Man064_Woman069_0097,way but sort of like everything's new
Man064_Woman069_0098,and shiny and beautiful and you're not
Man064_Woman069_0099,afraid to ask questions even if there's
Man064_Woman069_0100,simple questions like what does that
Man064_Woman069_0101,word mean I appreciate that
Man064_Woman069_0102,how is money a conflict in our
Man064_Woman069_0103,relationship Wow why do you snort about
Man064_Woman069_0104,it well we don't have much to conflict
Man064_Woman069_0105,which almost makes it worse right
Man064_Woman069_0106,not necessarily I feel like I don't know
Man064_Woman069_0107,I feel like we don't argue too much
Man064_Woman069_0108,about money we just don't have a lot yes
Man064_Woman069_0109,I think it becomes an issue because we
Man064_Woman069_0110,we can't be independent at this
Man064_Woman069_0111,particular moment in our lives
Man064_Woman069_0112,we're just kind of crappy like watching
Man064_Woman069_0113,all of our friends buy houses or you
Man064_Woman069_0114,know move places and get real jobs like
Man064_Woman069_0115,but I'm choosing not to work like we've
Man064_Woman069_0116,chosen that so that I can be with baby
Man064_Woman069_0117,and you have a salary which is awesome
Man064_Woman069_0118,and we can live on that
Man064_Woman069_0119,can't we yeah we can we can live on that
Man064_Woman069_0120,and we make it work and I think it it's
Man064_Woman069_0121,just challenging when we can't we can't
Man064_Woman069_0122,do something we get really excited about
Man064_Woman069_0123,like mm-hmm
Man064_Woman069_0124,let's build a tiny house and drive
Man064_Woman069_0125,wherever the heck we want we can't right
Man064_Woman069_0126,now because we don't have $30,000
Man064_Woman069_0127,sitting around you know right but I
Man064_Woman069_0128,think that doesn't stop us from dreaming
Man064_Woman069_0129,and we just have to make sure that we
Man064_Woman069_0130,find the right dream to put that money
Man064_Woman069_0131,into yeah
Man064_Woman069_0132,I can answer it I don't think that money
Man064_Woman069_0133,is really gonna conflict more about what
Man064_Woman069_0134,to do so what do we do have and that's
Man064_Woman069_0135,the conflict within myself too
Man064_Woman069_0136,you know it's a means to an end and I
Man064_Woman069_0137,don't I don't have aspirations or
Man064_Woman069_0138,financial gain so much as just being
Man064_Woman069_0139,able to do things with that yeah that
Man064_Woman069_0140,are experiential you know go and road
Man064_Woman069_0141,trips visit national parks and you know
Man064_Woman069_0142,go visit other cultures and understand
Man064_Woman069_0143,it's like to be somewhere else in the
Man064_Woman069_0144,world where I've never been I appreciate
Man064_Woman069_0145,that I don't think that's common and
Man064_Woman069_0146,right the best sex you ever had
Man064_Woman069_0147,yeah good yeah you know not much to
Man064_Woman069_0148,compare it that's not really saying much
Man064_Woman069_0149,then
Man064_Woman069_0150,[Laughter]
Man064_Woman069_0151,oh yeah what do I give you that none of
Man064_Woman069_0152,your other partners did mmm freedom to
Man064_Woman069_0153,be myself that took me a long time to
Man064_Woman069_0154,learn that I could be me in relationship
Man064_Woman069_0155,with you instead of being your something
Man064_Woman069_0156,you know like I'm not your wife or your
Man064_Woman069_0157,girlfriend I am myself and I have
Man064_Woman069_0158,entered into a partnership with you and
Man064_Woman069_0159,that gives me freedom to be who I am and
Man064_Woman069_0160,define myself by my own terms
Man064_Woman069_0161,and you have never once judged that or
Man064_Woman069_0162,suffocated that part of me and I think
Man064_Woman069_0163,that's part of the reason that I fell in
Man064_Woman069_0164,love with you and that over that I knew
Man064_Woman069_0165,it would work
Man064_Woman069_0166,you know because you never you never put
Man064_Woman069_0167,pressure on me to be anything to you
Man064_Woman069_0168,other than Who I am because I felt like
Man064_Woman069_0169,who you are and I want you to be you
Man064_Woman069_0170,somebody told me once that you should
Man064_Woman069_0171,you should be you because nobody else
Man064_Woman069_0172,will be you I think it was some one of
Man064_Woman069_0173,those motivational posters in elementary
Man064_Woman069_0174,school maybe mm-hmm really so not only
Man064_Woman069_0175,am i everybody else is also do you want
Man064_Woman069_0176,to burp in
Man064_Woman069_0177,all right work me in baby huh
Man064_Woman069_0178,[Music]
Man064_Woman069_0179,when do you worry about me and why I
Man064_Woman069_0180,think I would say I was most worried
Man064_Woman069_0181,about you when we were trying to make
Man064_Woman069_0182,things work and you were in school and
Man064_Woman069_0183,also working and I could tell you her
Man064_Woman069_0184,stressed and the panic attacks really
Man064_Woman069_0185,freaked me out
Man064_Woman069_0186,yeah it's something I'm not familiar
Man064_Woman069_0187,with I don't tend towards stress so it's
Man064_Woman069_0188,it was hard to respond to and I was
Man064_Woman069_0189,worried about you yeah yeah and I see
Man064_Woman069_0190,your mom being stressed out a lot I mean
Man064_Woman069_0191,you're very different than her in some
Man064_Woman069_0192,ways but you know yeah I just hope it's
Man064_Woman069_0193,not something that ends up really
Man064_Woman069_0194,wearing on you yeah I think I had to
Man064_Woman069_0195,figure out how to balance my life and
Man064_Woman069_0196,that when I am overwhelmed that's that's
Man064_Woman069_0197,how it manifests but I think that I
Man064_Woman069_0198,think we've kind of come to a place
Man064_Woman069_0199,where it's where's the burp ah can you
Man064_Woman069_0200,grab that such as life my love dear Oh
Man064_Woman069_0201,gross that's you made a mess
Man064_Woman069_0202,okay now alright let's see if it'll sit
Man064_Woman069_0203,on my way what would make you leave me I
Man064_Woman069_0204,think if you became abusive especially
Man064_Woman069_0205,toward the baby
Man064_Woman069_0206,but I don't know if you have an abusive
Man064_Woman069_0207,bone in your body
Man064_Woman069_0208,I do what house flies out the windows
Man064_Woman069_0209,after all but I think that would be in I
Man064_Woman069_0210,would I wouldn't put up with that
Man064_Woman069_0211,shouldn't nobody should know I know what
Man064_Woman069_0212,could I do to improve our relationship
Man064_Woman069_0213,[Music]
Man064_Woman069_0214,yeah sure what to say I feel like we're
Man064_Woman069_0215,in a really good place like communicate
Man064_Woman069_0216,well we're still in love after a few
Man064_Woman069_0217,years we got this little bundle of joy
Man064_Woman069_0218,what if I stopped cleaning before bed it
Man064_Woman069_0219,does kind of bug me actually it's not
Man064_Woman069_0220,even that you clean before bed it's that
Man064_Woman069_0221,I'm expected to help you clean before
Man064_Woman069_0222,bed
Man064_Woman069_0223,indeed you are really I want to help you
Man064_Woman069_0224,with stuff but I don't want to do right
Man064_Woman069_0225,before bed that's why down time yeah but
Man064_Woman069_0226,I mean you know in the scheme of things
Man064_Woman069_0227,that's not a big thing and what that
Man064_Woman069_0228,means that much to you you know we can
Man064_Woman069_0229,clean before bed give me crap about it
Man064_Woman069_0230,anyway I'd rather wake up and have a
Man064_Woman069_0231,coffee and then clean
Man064_Woman069_0232,yeah I know is it my turn oh no it's
Man064_Woman069_0233,your turn thank you what do you think is
Man064_Woman069_0234,the hardest thing for me right now
Man064_Woman069_0235,living at my parents house not being
Man064_Woman069_0236,able to travel with your band or build
Man064_Woman069_0237,it your dream home yeah I think just
Man064_Woman069_0238,that like where we are in this moment
Man064_Woman069_0239,it's hard for you yeah I think being
Man064_Woman069_0240,patient right now it's tough ma'am
Man064_Woman069_0241,you know I have a lot of aspirations and
Man064_Woman069_0242,I feel like I'm wasting time if I'm not
Man064_Woman069_0243,making them come true I'm not working
Man064_Woman069_0244,toward them but I mean I really value
Man064_Woman069_0245,the fact that your parents took us in
Man064_Woman069_0246,and you know I think we're in a really
Man064_Woman069_0247,good place it's just a matter of waiting
Man064_Woman069_0248,for the next thing - yeah to start and
Man064_Woman069_0249,if it's not time yeah you know it's not
Man064_Woman069_0250,easy but what do you think what's the
Man064_Woman069_0251,hardest thing for you right now
Man064_Woman069_0252,well you're supposed to say what you
Man064_Woman069_0253,think the hardest thing you ever made
Man064_Woman069_0254,okay I mean you have a whole side
Man064_Woman069_0255,challenges with learning to raise him
Man064_Woman069_0256,and I've I've relied on you from that
Man064_Woman069_0257,I'm sure that's not easy
Man064_Woman069_0258,am i right is that probably what you
Man064_Woman069_0259,would say
Man064_Woman069_0260,ha yeah I think that I think a
Man064_Woman069_0261,combination of you know being learning
Man064_Woman069_0262,how to raise a baby and also not being
Man064_Woman069_0263,able to kind of move forward with my
Man064_Woman069_0264,work yeah
Man064_Woman069_0265,I'm torn about that boy you be what's in
Man064_Woman069_0266,there yeah I think so what have you
Man064_Woman069_0267,learned about me since having our son
Man064_Woman069_0268,that you didn't know before I mean I
Man064_Woman069_0269,guess I I thought you were gonna be a
Man064_Woman069_0270,great mom
Man064_Woman069_0271,but seeing you in the role is different
Man064_Woman069_0272,you know how so not that it's a bad
Man064_Woman069_0273,thing I just you know when we met and
Man064_Woman069_0274,started dating and got married it's like
Man064_Woman069_0275,I never pictured you as as mom I can't
Man064_Woman069_0276,pictured you as my love you know and I
Man064_Woman069_0277,guess growing up we have perceptions of
Man064_Woman069_0278,parents based on our parents and you
Man064_Woman069_0279,know it's just really different seeing
Man064_Woman069_0280,it somebody who I'm so close to like
Man064_Woman069_0281,stepping into that role you know can I
Man064_Woman069_0282,be both your love and the mother of your
Man064_Woman069_0283,yeah of course it's yeah it's not a
Man064_Woman069_0284,switch it's an and yeah and you have to
Man064_Woman069_0285,be dad too you know
Man064_Woman069_0286,that's sweet to see sweet to see how
Man064_Woman069_0287,much you love him
Man064_Woman069_0288,if you love you because a little place
Man064_Woman069_0289,one drill hmm yeah just let him chew on
Man064_Woman069_0290,it whatever yeah I think it's still
Man064_Woman069_0291,weird to categorize myself as dead
Man064_Woman069_0292,yeah I'm honored by the role and you
Man064_Woman069_0293,know I'm beat I'm here to find out what
Man064_Woman069_0294,its gonna be like with him as he grows
Man064_Woman069_0295,up and we both will both grow and learn
Man064_Woman069_0296,I mean that's why babies start out as
Man064_Woman069_0297,babies so the parents tough adherence
Man064_Woman069_0298,kid I figured out we just have to do
Man064_Woman069_0299,with like basic bodily functions at
Man064_Woman069_0300,first and then they get into trouble and
Man064_Woman069_0301,then we learn I think it was you know
Man064_Woman069_0302,intended for the parents not for the
Man064_Woman069_0303,babies that they start out this
Man064_Woman069_0304,do you think that we're still a good
Man064_Woman069_0305,match why or why not I do I'd absolutely
Man064_Woman069_0306,do why I think because we constantly
Man064_Woman069_0307,challenge each other we push each other
Man064_Woman069_0308,and at the same time we're very
Man064_Woman069_0309,sensitive to each other's needs and and
Man064_Woman069_0310,don't maybe pushing in places that don't
Man064_Woman069_0311,need to be pushed you know and we
Man064_Woman069_0312,communicate really well I think that's I
Man064_Woman069_0313,think that the fact that we have always
Man064_Woman069_0314,been honest and have a policy of being
Man064_Woman069_0315,honest with each other I think that that
Man064_Woman069_0316,really helps us to work through whatever
Man064_Woman069_0317,things might otherwise become barriers
Man064_Woman069_0318,between us and I think that that open
Man064_Woman069_0319,communication and and we have some
Man064_Woman069_0320,certain things in common you know that
Man064_Woman069_0321,we can go and do together like we love
Man064_Woman069_0322,to do outdoor things and to travel and
Man064_Woman069_0323,you know those those things are things
Man064_Woman069_0324,we can enjoy together but we also have
Man064_Woman069_0325,things that we do that are not together
Man064_Woman069_0326,and I think that's also healthy like I
Man064_Woman069_0327,don't need to go moshing with you and
Man064_Woman069_0328,you don't need to go to yoga with me and
Man064_Woman069_0329,that's okay because we have our we have
Man064_Woman069_0330,our separate interests was that hard at
Man064_Woman069_0331,first it was hard at first yeah at first
Man064_Woman069_0332,because remember I had to learn how to
Man064_Woman069_0333,be me mm-hmm on my own and not not just
Man064_Woman069_0334,do whatever the guy I was dating was
Man064_Woman069_0335,doing so when I didn't come to your
Man064_Woman069_0336,classes at first I was like really upset
Man064_Woman069_0337,about it I was bummed it was like why
Man064_Woman069_0338,won't he try this but then I realized
Man064_Woman069_0339,like I have absolutely no desire to be
Man064_Woman069_0340,in a mosh pit so like I can't expect you
Man064_Woman069_0341,to you know put stretchy pants on your
Man064_Woman069_0342,head if you don't want to I think I'm
Man064_Woman069_0343,break my leg yeah yeah well I think I
Man064_Woman069_0344,would break my neck if I was Martian
Man064_Woman069_0345,yeah fortunately I have them right yeah
Man064_Woman069_0346,what is the secret that you've been too
Man064_Woman069_0347,afraid to tell me and a secret have been
Man064_Woman069_0348,too afraid to tell you to think about
Man064_Woman069_0349,that I don't I don't have any secrets we
Man064_Woman069_0350,talk about a lot yeah I sort of process
Man064_Woman069_0351,verbally
Man064_Woman069_0352,[Music]
Man064_Woman069_0353,I really think I told you all my secrets
Man064_Woman069_0354,I'm not coming up with anything
Man064_Woman069_0355,I mean we met talking about a lot of
Man064_Woman069_0356,really deep stuff and I think processing
Man064_Woman069_0357,through that Puran struggles on you know
Man064_Woman069_0358,on both sides and sharing that with each
Man064_Woman069_0359,other and and slowly sort of building an
Man064_Woman069_0360,attraction afterwards um set us up for
Man064_Woman069_0361,this point where it's like we could just
Man064_Woman069_0362,talk about anything yeah without like
Man064_Woman069_0363,losing somebody who had crushes on for
Man064_Woman069_0364,years or you know yeah there was there
Man064_Woman069_0365,was so little pressure at the beginning
Man064_Woman069_0366,that we just I at least just started off
Man064_Woman069_0367,completely open and yeah and we met each
Man064_Woman069_0368,other sort of on a level plane and we
Man064_Woman069_0369,weren't I don't think we had any
Man064_Woman069_0370,expectations of each other yeah so we we
Man064_Woman069_0371,were just able to be really authentic
Man064_Woman069_0372,and genuine I don't have any secrets
Man064_Woman069_0373,from you either except maybe when I like
Man064_Woman069_0374,buy a shirt and you told me not to

Man064_Woman069_0409,yeah but I mean yeah yeah I wish the
Man064_Woman069_0410,same also when you when I read that

Man064_Woman069_0417,within myself
Man064_Woman069_0418,[Music]
Man064_Woman069_0419,I think don't you see I think you're
Man064_Woman069_0420,rather astute astute and self reflective
Man064_Woman069_0421,so you see a lot of wonderful things in
Man064_Woman069_0422,yourself I think that they're I mean of
Man064_Woman069_0423,course I love your creativity and your
Man064_Woman069_0424,enthusiasm and your you know curiosity
Man064_Woman069_0425,but you know those things mmm
Man064_Woman069_0426,I think that there is something deeply
Man064_Woman069_0427,spiritual and reflective in you that you
Man064_Woman069_0428,you're sort of new glimpse you know that
Man064_Woman069_0429,you're sort of touching on right now in
Man064_Woman069_0430,your life that you have begun to explore
Man064_Woman069_0431,especially in your artwork lately but I
Man064_Woman069_0432,think that there's just something very
Man064_Woman069_0433,profound spiritually and you that you
Man064_Woman069_0434,you may not see sometimes because of all
Man064_Woman069_0435,of those other things that I love about
Man064_Woman069_0436,you know like you're so creative and
Man064_Woman069_0437,excited and enthusiastic and you're like
Man064_Woman069_0438,such a Sagittarius you know and your
Man064_Woman069_0439,puppy-dog yeah and those things might
Man064_Woman069_0440,sort of cloud that quiet space in you
Man064_Woman069_0441,that reflective spiritual place hmm I
Man064_Woman069_0442,was just telling somebody yesterday
Man064_Woman069_0443,actually mr. myson it was just telling
Man064_Woman069_0444,somebody that um I didn't grow up with a
Man064_Woman069_0445,whole lot of like quiet reflective time
Man064_Woman069_0446,as a kid it was punishment said
Man064_Woman069_0447,somewhere quiet you know I couldn't do
Man064_Woman069_0448,it which is I guess it was really
Man064_Woman069_0449,effective but as I hated that place not
Man064_Woman069_0450,doing anything I'm still hate that but I
Man064_Woman069_0451,think seeing the value that you get from
Man064_Woman069_0452,meditation and from yoga
Man064_Woman069_0453,I've realized that there is something
Man064_Woman069_0454,about that quiet space where the calm
Man064_Woman069_0455,allows you to think in a different way
Man064_Woman069_0456,and allows you to follow a thought far
Man064_Woman069_0457,enough to get to someplace you hadn't
Man064_Woman069_0458,before that's really new to me and it's
Man064_Woman069_0459,been interesting to kind of get into
Man064_Woman069_0460,that space a little bit yeah and like
Man064_Woman069_0461,you said yeah I think I think my recent
Man064_Woman069_0462,artwork has been a way to get into a
Man064_Woman069_0463,spiritual reflective meditative space
Man064_Woman069_0464,remember when you were in the hammock
Man064_Woman069_0465,and on the back porch in Baltimore and I
Man064_Woman069_0466,think you were like praying or something
Man064_Woman069_0467,and I came home from work and you said
Man064_Woman069_0468,that you really felt like God was
Man064_Woman069_0469,telling you to be still I remember
Man064_Woman069_0470,vaguely yeah I don't remember saying
Man064_Woman069_0471,that but yeah just take things like one
Man064_Woman069_0472,step at a time and be still and I think
Man064_Woman069_0473,that's something you struggle to do but
Man064_Woman069_0474,I also think that that would open up
Man064_Woman069_0475,amazing possibilities for you because
Man064_Woman069_0476,you're I think your mind works faster
Man064_Woman069_0477,than your body is able to like
Man064_Woman069_0478,accomplish things and maybe slowing it
Man064_Woman069_0479,down you would be able to bring to
Man064_Woman069_0480,fruition all of those amazing ideas and
Man064_Woman069_0481,big dreams that you have maybe that's
Man064_Woman069_0482,why I stopped short of finishing things
Man064_Woman069_0483,cuz I get too excited about the next
Man064_Woman069_0484,video yeah and maybe that's part of why
Man064_Woman069_0485,you have trouble feeling fulfilled like
Man064_Woman069_0486,things aren't finished
Man064_Woman069_0487,because they're not yeah
Man064_Woman069_0488,how is the baby changed our relationship
Man064_Woman069_0489,in a way you wish it had not something
Man064_Woman069_0490,you don't like yeah a lot of goods come
Man064_Woman069_0491,from it I mean we both love the
Man064_Woman069_0492,stuffings out of it yeah I mean we have
Man064_Woman069_0493,had less down time together because one
Man064_Woman069_0494,of us is usually busy with the baby and
Man064_Woman069_0495,that's tough to get used to you know but
Man064_Woman069_0496,practically I think that's just what
Man064_Woman069_0497,that's like you know you you have to
Man064_Woman069_0498,spend some time with him do and and I
Man064_Woman069_0499,don't I don't regret that but you know
Man064_Woman069_0500,date night is really tough that kind of
Man064_Woman069_0501,thing right exactly so they're like five
Man064_Woman069_0502,minutes at the end of the day where
Man064_Woman069_0503,we're like dude we hug today yeah yeah
Man064_Woman069_0504,that's been tough yeah it is but you
Man064_Woman069_0505,know I think overall we're gonna have
Man064_Woman069_0506,more joy and more laughter and and more
Man064_Woman069_0507,fun you know then we might have thought
Man064_Woman069_0508,to have on our own
Man064_Woman069_0509,even though I might wish to have more
Man064_Woman069_0510,time alone with you without a baby
Man064_Woman069_0511,screaming without you needing a nurse or
Man064_Woman069_0512,me picking up whatever you drop you know
Man064_Woman069_0513,even though I might wish that I'd that's
Man064_Woman069_0514,not stronger than then the flip side of
Man064_Woman069_0515,being glad that he's here and glad that
Man064_Woman069_0516,we're where we are in life it's a good
Man064_Woman069_0517,perspective I think
Man064_Woman069_0518,nobody said it was easy right do i
Man064_Woman069_0519,hender the dreamer in you why am I not
Man064_Woman069_0520,thanked you focus the dreamer I think I
Man064_Woman069_0521,think you find interest or value in in
Man064_Woman069_0522,some of those thoughts or those aspects
Man064_Woman069_0523,of my personality but I tend not to be
Man064_Woman069_0524,very good about kind of arranging things
Man064_Woman069_0525,and organizing and planning and making
Man064_Woman069_0526,decisions based on logic rather than
Man064_Woman069_0527,just jumping because I want to and you
Man064_Woman069_0528,know I need somebody that can be like if
Man064_Woman069_0529,you want to do that you should do this
Man064_Woman069_0530,this and this because ya look weird
Man064_Woman069_0531,that's gonna be said you know and that's
Man064_Woman069_0532,a tough thing for me to do for some
Man064_Woman069_0533,reason so no I I don't think you hinder
Man064_Woman069_0534,the dreamer at all I mean that I think
Man064_Woman069_0535,you helped me think about how to make
Man064_Woman069_0536,those dreams effective which is I think
Man064_Woman069_0537,something that like it's really honoring
Man064_Woman069_0538,it makes me feel like you care about me
Man064_Woman069_0539,and what I hope for and sometimes I
Man064_Woman069_0540,worry I wouldn't say you hold me back
Man064_Woman069_0541,hold you down
Man064_Woman069_0542,you got a face what's that one say what
Man064_Woman069_0543,is your best and worst childhood memory
Man064_Woman069_0544,that's so hard to pick the best pick the
Man064_Woman069_0545,worse than like I'm thinking of all
Man064_Woman069_0546,these things that come to mind when I
Man064_Woman069_0547,had a great childhood but I think one of
Man064_Woman069_0548,the coolest moments in my memory is each
Man064_Woman069_0549,summer would spend a week at my
Man064_Woman069_0550,grandparents house down by the
Man064_Woman069_0551,Chesapeake Bay and they had a little
Man064_Woman069_0552,rowboat and my brothers and I would get
Man064_Woman069_0553,in the rowboat and it was actually only
Man064_Woman069_0554,a two-seater but the three of us would
Man064_Woman069_0555,jump in and we'd paddle across the creek
Man064_Woman069_0556,and go exploring we made buoys out of
Man064_Woman069_0557,bottles with bobbers on them and we
Man064_Woman069_0558,called the other side of the section of
Man064_Woman069_0559,the bay we called it Treasure Island and
Man064_Woman069_0560,I felt like an explorer you know there
Man064_Woman069_0561,was a cliff and we couldn't get up it so
Man064_Woman069_0562,we didn't know what was up there and it
Man064_Woman069_0563,was always very mysterious and
Man064_Woman069_0564,interesting anyway at one point we went
Man064_Woman069_0565,down to the dock and it was later in the
Man064_Woman069_0566,afternoon and the storm is coming and
Man064_Woman069_0567,the Sun was setting and this guy was
Man064_Woman069_0568,really weird pink big dark clouds coming
Man064_Woman069_0569,towards us and the water there was
Man064_Woman069_0570,glassy flat and it could see ripples
Man064_Woman069_0571,coming from further away closer and
Man064_Woman069_0572,closer and then suddenly this wall of
Man064_Woman069_0573,air hit us and you know like like a step
Man064_Woman069_0574,back and the hair grew back and gary was
Man064_Woman069_0575,there my younger brother was there and
Man064_Woman069_0576,we were both like that was the weirdest
Man064_Woman069_0577,thing ever and just have this little
Man064_Woman069_0578,laugh about it there's something about
Man064_Woman069_0579,that that seems really profound that I
Man064_Woman069_0580,don't quite understand that kind of
Man064_Woman069_0581,sticks out I mean I have memories
Man064_Woman069_0582,playing kickball with my dad and he'd
Man064_Woman069_0583,let us ride in his lawnmower with him
Man064_Woman069_0584,well you played kickball one time you
Man064_Woman069_0585,took a kickball and I asked him how high
Man064_Woman069_0586,you could punted I asked him if he could
Man064_Woman069_0587,punch it through the clouds and he said
Man064_Woman069_0588,well let's see and he took the kickball
Man064_Woman069_0589,and kicked it as high as he could I felt
Man064_Woman069_0590,like it disappeared you know he's a
Man064_Woman069_0591,little kid it went so high
Man064_Woman069_0592,and he doesn't he doesn't kind of
Man064_Woman069_0593,indulge yeah and in silly things like
Man064_Woman069_0594,that much anymore and that was one of my
Man064_Woman069_0595,favorite memories with him yeah it's
Man064_Woman069_0596,what about the flipside worse than me
Man064_Woman069_0597,I can I can think of two points probably
Man064_Woman069_0598,that really stick out when I was
Man064_Woman069_0599,depressed in high school and and it got
Man064_Woman069_0600,to the point I didn't I decided I didn't
Man064_Woman069_0601,want to live fortunately my intentions
Man064_Woman069_0602,didn't work out or come true and I'm I'm
Man064_Woman069_0603,happy to be here but that was that that
Man064_Woman069_0604,was the lowest I've ever been
Man064_Woman069_0605,and then the girls dating in high school
Man064_Woman069_0606,we've been together for about a year and
Man064_Woman069_0607,a half probably we decided to break up
Man064_Woman069_0608,for a little while and see how it was
Man064_Woman069_0609,with things apart and so I didn't take
Man064_Woman069_0610,her to prom that year she went to her
Man064_Woman069_0611,best friend's prom in a different School
Man064_Woman069_0612,District with the best friend's brother
Man064_Woman069_0613,as a date and that night he raped her
Man064_Woman069_0614,and when I think when she told me that
Man064_Woman069_0615,and I saw I saw kind of brokenness I
Man064_Woman069_0616,hadn't seen before that was a real
Man064_Woman069_0617,little point for me too and they think
Man064_Woman069_0618,you know we ended up dating after that
Man064_Woman069_0619,again for another year or so and I
Man064_Woman069_0620,always kind of worried about it with
Man064_Woman069_0621,that you can't really I don't want to
Man064_Woman069_0622,bring it up yeah we really talked but
Man064_Woman069_0623,and I've met other people that have been
Man064_Woman069_0624,through that sense you know and
Man064_Woman069_0625,I feel like I've been able to respond a
Man064_Woman069_0626,little more intentionally to those
Man064_Woman069_0627,people you're uniquely positioned I
Man064_Woman069_0628,think to speak profoundly to people who
Man064_Woman069_0629,have experienced that kind of depth of
Man064_Woman069_0630,depression and like sexual violence I
Man064_Woman069_0631,think they that you're really able to
Man064_Woman069_0632,speak to those people in a gentle way an
Man064_Woman069_0633,understanding way that a lot of people
Man064_Woman069_0634,can't that's beautiful I think those
Man064_Woman069_0635,experiences I mean we all have
Man064_Woman069_0636,experiences that form us and shape us
Man064_Woman069_0637,and uniquely position us and those are
Man064_Woman069_0638,yours yeah I wish that of anybody you
Man064_Woman069_0639,know and you know you're the first
Man064_Woman069_0640,person who told me it wasn't my fault
Man064_Woman069_0641,maybe that's my I couldn't believe
