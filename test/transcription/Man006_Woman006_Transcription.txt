Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0001,all right let's see what we've got what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0002,do you remember from the first time we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0003,met the first time we met was at my
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0004,college at least and I was setting up
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0005,chairs and I think he thought I was a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0006,janitor I was wearing sweat pants and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0007,was not prepared to set up your life
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0008,presence out of my life or meet you and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0009,I wasn't really interested in meeting
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0010,anyone and kind of just went from there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0011,all I really remember was talking about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0012,Taylor Swift and talking about how guys
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0013,love when the bass drops in that song
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0014,that sounded like the goats I knew you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0015,were trouble yeah that's really all I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0016,remember from the first time that we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0017,read I remember the next time we met a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0018,little bit better heard a real first
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0019,song that I talked about but a good
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0020,first impression
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0021,okay first impression what do you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0022,remember about the first time we met I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0023,think probably about the same as you I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0024,mean I didn't I certainly don't think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0025,either of us wanted to have any
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0026,expectation of meeting somebody you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0027,liked in a romantic way but I remember
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0028,being happy I was there because there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0029,was a blizzard outside nothing one shows
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0030,to happen and this meeting I'm talking
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0031,to you before the show I thought you're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0032,cool but I kind of dismissed it as like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0033,well that's something that I'm not going
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0034,to meet again don't use nice I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0035,that's the truth you know I don't think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0036,they either of us really thought we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0037,would encounter each other all this all
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0038,this business
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0039,okay list your top three memories we've
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0040,had together well I mean I would say
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0041,probably the obvious one is us getting
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0042,engaged but I want to work I would say
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0043,the first would be spending that whole
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0044,first weekend together the week after we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0045,met because that was kind of where it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0046,went from like oh here's this person I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0047,was I didn't think I was gonna be ever
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0048,again - all of a sudden now we're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0049,hanging out we have this chemistry and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0050,this is really exciting but I think even
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0051,leaving that weekend neither of us
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0052,really knew what was going to happen but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0053,it was the first time in a long time
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0054,that I was like really excited about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0055,something I think well the third one is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0056,the engagement which I'll get to I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0057,number two is probably it's probably
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0058,gonna grafting with you the first summer
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0059,we were together when we I had never
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0060,gone away water rafting I was very
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0061,nervous about that yeah very very
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0062,nervous I had all sorts of visions of me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0063,getting my head against a rocket and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0064,that being the end of it but that was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0065,one of those times where I just felt
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0066,like we've been a that's like maybe like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0067,three or four months at that point and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0068,then
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0069,that was the first time that I realized
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0070,how much fun I had with you all the time
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0071,and also how adept a ten year old kid is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0072,at setting up the tents conveyances
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0073,leaving a basically flat intent for the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0074,first night but the third the third and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0075,most important one is definitely us
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0076,getting engaged because I thought the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0077,weirdest part to me still is that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0078,thought you knew what was coming because
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0079,we had talked about like what kind of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0080,ring do you want like this is something
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0081,that's somewhat imminent and might
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0082,happen and then when we're going up to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0083,your parents house that morning and you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0084,specifically said offhandedly like don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0085,ever surprise me with the proposal
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0086,because I was making fun of you for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0087,always watching the end of reality shows
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0088,before you watch the beginning because
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0089,you don't get to attach the characters
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0090,that I kind of threw me up and then the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0091,longest day that I've ever experienced
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0092,continued where it was ten hours of me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0093,literally not listening to anything you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0094,were saying but the fact that it took me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0095,taking a ring out and your entire family
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0096,knowing what's going on before you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0097,realized and then you swearing in front
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0098,of your grandmother I don't know if I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0099,can swear here but it was great all
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0100,right
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0101,you could swear by the way okay well in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0102,that case she said holy fuck in front of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0103,her 86 year old grandmother was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0104,phenomenal I don't think you a bad news
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0105,[Music]
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0106,all right well this how that goes right
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0107,into that why did you want to marry me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0108,there are a lot of reasons I wanted to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0109,marry you I think that one of the main
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0110,reasons that I wanted to marry you and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0111,still want to marry or because we get
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0112,along so seamlessly I think that when we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0113,talk about it and when people ask us you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0114,know what you argue about it or what you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0115,know what do you guys talk about theater
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0116,why do you guys get along or really just
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0117,any of those reasons there are so many
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0118,things and so many reasons that we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0119,shouldn't be together it's so many
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0120,things that shouldn't have brought us
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0121,together and so many things that like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0122,should have happened to push us apart
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0123,yeah it'll be the long distance for a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0124,year and a half and I was still in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0125,college I mean that and we could have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0126,broken up so many times in there and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0127,thanks for really hard for so long but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0128,like through all of that time and not to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0129,say that things weren't hard and like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0130,there were probably times that we both
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0131,questions whether or not we're making
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0132,the right decision but like through all
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0133,of that and just seems so clear at the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0134,end of it that you're the person that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0135,was supposed to be with it and it was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0136,crazy because moving down to New York
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0137,didn't even seem like a big deal like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0138,moving from me into New York it was like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0139,no big deal
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0140,moving in together
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0141,I mean it's so minted leading up to it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0142,but actually once we once that happen
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0143,you know yeah but now that we live
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0144,together it's like no big deal well it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0145,was like we move in together and nothing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0146,changed right I didn't even notice it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0147,almost right well no but I think I feel
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0148,like the only struggles we ever had were
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0149,due to outside factors like any time
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0150,yeah you and I being together was always
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0151,really easy yeah I also think that the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0152,fact that we just wanted to seed a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0153,little more and didn't have the ability
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0154,to I think so makes us appreciate each
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0155,other more now and I think of whatever
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0156,if we had just started dating and we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0157,lived in the same city and moved in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0158,after two months of some people did I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0159,also I think that right from the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0160,beginning one of the biggest things
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0161,about you is I've had such an inherent
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0162,level of trust in you I've never ever
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0163,damaged you like ever I have always
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0164,known that no matter what I could always
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0165,know that you've had my back
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0166,like most people and long-distance
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0167,relationships would not be able to be
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0168,like oh yeah well that's my boyfriend
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0169,this median through Charles around to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0170,different colleges where he also met me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0171,College Sutan where he also met me at a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0172,party you know and all of a sudden like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0173,how are you supposed to trust him like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0174,that but just it was almost unspoken
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0175,that we just inherently trusted each
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0176,other and having that right from the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0177,beginning was so important I think both
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0178,of us growing together and obviously you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0179,know that's core and communication is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0180,cooler listening his car yeah anytime
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0181,your long-distance and you if you don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0182,have trust in that situation you're done
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0183,that's what I wanna marry you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0184,how do you describe me to others I don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0185,know that it comes up that much I feel
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0186,like that's a weird thing to say but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0187,like in that direct of a form it like I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0188,guess I'm thinking of how well when I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0189,first described you to my parents
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0190,let's start with that because I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0191,because of the fact that there was the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0192,age difference and not even that eight
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0193,times but four and a half years which is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0194,not a big deal
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0195,in the grand scheme of things but the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0196,fact that you were at college at the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0197,time I think when I would describe you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0198,of people especially early on it would
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0199,be me having to like justify it and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0200,probably you to the same extent of like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0201,are you dating this touring example
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0202,meaningful lives in New York but when I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0203,told my parents that I the you and I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0204,were dating and that you were still in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0205,college I think they immediately judged
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0206,well what kind of person you were which
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0207,I understand because a lot of 21 year
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0208,old college girls are not the most
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0209,mature people in the world I don't think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0210,a lot of people in college are but the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0211,thing I was stressed was that it never I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0212,heard I had to remind myself and I self
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0213,remind remind yourself how young you are
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0214,relatively because I've never gotten
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0215,that vibe from you like I feel like in a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0216,lot of ways you're a lot more mature
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0217,than I am a lot more mature than a lot
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0218,of people in their 40s and that's either
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0219,your personality or just a combination
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0220,your personality and the fact that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0221,you've had to kind of be the adult a lot
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0222,of situations with your family and stuff
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0223,growing up and that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0224,and I feel like you've always had to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0225,take a lot of responsibility and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0226,therefore you didn't have the luxury of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0227,like goofing around but yeah I mean I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0228,think that was kind of the way I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0229,conveyed to my parents to let them know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0230,like I'm not something like creep and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0231,she's not so maybe it and what I told
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0232,them well I told my friends about you it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0233,was just I think the thing that I said
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0234,that most often was that it just like it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0235,felt different and I hadn't felt that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0236,way about anybody in a long time and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0237,then and then ever you know maybe like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0238,as things progressed it was clear to me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0239,that what you and I had going out was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0240,something that I hadn't had with anybody
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0241,else and I think you always are
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0242,comparing it a relationship to whatever
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0243,the best relationship you think you had
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0244,in the past was and then all of sudden
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0245,that surpasses it and you're like oh I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0246,guess I don't have to be hung up on that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0247,anymore so yeah I think just as somebody
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0248,who's kind didn't mature and someone who
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0249,I have what is similar and different so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0250,similar I definitely say that in a lot
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0251,of ways were on you know the same
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0252,wavelength when it comes to you know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0253,what we care about how we sort of like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0254,approach life like pretty even-keeled
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0255,people you know don't like to go out too
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0256,much which I also like value you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0257,obviously got a 92 but that's certainly
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0258,a job but you know I think that we have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0259,the same approach to a lot of different
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0260,issues and you know we don't we're just
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0261,kind of calm people I like that about us
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0262,I don't really know how I mean I don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0263,know how we're different that's probably
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0264,something I should well I mean not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0265,necessarily
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0266,we certainly are a lot more similar than
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0267,we are different obviously our lives are
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0268,incredibly different but yeah well
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0269,that's kind of like the biggest thing I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0270,mean obviously I work all day so that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0271,would probably be a person I mean that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0272,the thing because it's one thing to tell
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0273,people like why you're interested in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0274,somebody but the first time you you see
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0275,something with that person I think tells
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0276,you a lot and to me I've always had a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0277,good feel for that like when I see my
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0278,friends with the new grill of their date
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0279,like whether or not it's probably going
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0280,to work out and I think when people saw
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0281,us together that was the comment that we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0282,got more than anything else was like it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0283,seems like you two were just like locked
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0284,in in terms of just being on the same
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0285,wavelength in terms of not not only like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0286,sense of humor and personality but just
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0287,basically had a person I am the fact
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0288,that I'm sarcastic and I like to make
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0289,references to obscure things a lot of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0290,people were their friends their
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0291,girlfriends or anybody felt kind of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0292,alone for the rock that we know that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0293,I'll talk about but I feel like you and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0294,I both kind of bounce off each other and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0295,I mean we are kind of like a comedy duo
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0296,amongst our friends in a way of just
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0297,like something that we can work towards
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0298,yeah I think about Stephanie a big
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0299,differences you know the day job paint
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0300,job
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0301,well and also what like I think here's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0302,somebody who and obviously we've talked
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0303,about it before like you're much more
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0304,oriented towards small town than a city
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0305,house over the park of the yard or not a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0306,car and I think that's a byproduct the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0307,way you grew up but you know that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0308,something that you've been willing to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0309,compromise for the time being but I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0310,think that in terms of like what we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0311,value obviously the things that matter
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0312,in terms of family and what we believe
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0313,in a line but in terms of what be like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0314,where we envision ourselves living at
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0315,that kind of thing I think that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0316,probably been one of the only sources of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0317,my car yeah we'll deal with it another
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0318,day or ten years or five years or three
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0319,years when we move back to me why are
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0320,you hesitant to tell me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0321,I mean I think we're pretty open with
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0322,each other about most things I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0323,sometimes I'm hesitant to tell you like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0324,what my fears are regarding my future
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0325,and as a result our future like then you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0326,self doubt that I have regarding my
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0327,chosen career or whether or not I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0328,everything's in the pan now they try to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0329,I kind of try to keep that to myself as
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0330,I know earlier I was I feel like I was a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0331,lot more negative that I have now about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0332,how things were going for me and I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0333,that affected our relationship the times
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0334,of me letting that negativity or not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0335,being able to separate like I feel
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0336,shitty about the show that I've just did
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0337,so I'm gonna bring that over again for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0338,the conversation that I have with you so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0339,I think I try to kind of tamper that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0340,down when I'm able to and I don't I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0341,don't feel that way as much anymore but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0342,there are times where I feel like I'm
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0343,gonna sulk and I just kind of do that on
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0344,my own on the train that I kind of let
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0345,it go that's how I get sacks well but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0346,it's not you know I think if there's any
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0347,this situation where I'm upset I mean it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0348,just happened this weekend where I feel
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0349,like I sure didn't go well like I'll
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0350,always talk to you about that because I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0351,know not only that you're gonna listen
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0352,to me but you're gonna make me feel
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0353,better about it but I also don't want to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0354,argue with that because I work in a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0355,field where there's a lot of rejection
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0356,and negativity I did that every time I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0357,was upset about something you guys
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0358,really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0359,wimp so I don't know I mean in terms of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0360,other stuff that I have medicine to tell
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0361,you lay it all out there I don't know I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0362,mean I think we've we've gone out of our
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0363,way to talk about like people we've
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0364,dated and past relationships and that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0365,sort of thing because I think it really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0366,matters anymore like I know I feel like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0367,neither of us were really coming out
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0368,like oh I just don't wanna hear about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0369,anybody that you've been with this I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0370,feel like it's a little unhealthy
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0371,honestly when people have this weird
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0372,mindset of like oh well we're together
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0373,now so let's pretend that neither of us
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0374,have ever been with anybody else before
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0375,if anything I think that's probably not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0376,really the best approach but I don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0377,know I think we're pretty forthcoming
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0378,with each other are there things that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0379,you like actively keep from me I mean I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0380,think it goes to what we were saying
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0381,before about the difference in this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0382,where it's like every time I feel like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0383,oh okay homesickness to move back out of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0384,the city or like every time I hear a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0385,freaking car horn like can I just move
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0386,back to a place that doesn't have car
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0387,horns or you know a place where people
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0388,aren't yelling at each other all the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0389,time or you don't have to take the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0390,subway we'll don't sit on top of you or
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0391,stink all the time like lips or nose
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0392,clip their nails a public place like not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0393,a lot of that mean there isn't and you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0394,know when I think about raising a fan
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0395,getting married a lot of like my fears
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0396,around raising a family in the city come
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0397,up but I feel like where you don't tell
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0398,me all the time when you have a bad name
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0399,to show when I think about our future
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0400,together in New York I get really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0401,nervous about living here forever yeah
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0402,when we talk about buying a place in New
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0403,York like wow that seems like an awesome
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0404,idea it also seems like tying us really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0405,really deeply to New York and while
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0406,we're young that's awesome and it also
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0407,it's such a tough thing because you're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0408,so tied to here with your job and I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0409,could literally be anywhere as long as I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0410,have my computer like I could literally
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0411,anywhere and that's what makes it so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0412,tough to feel like I can always be like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0413,you know super honest about where would
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0414,be or you know how I totally see my
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0415,future with well I feel like even if we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0416,don't say it in specific terms we both
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0417,kind of have an understanding and an
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0418,agreement that like this is where I need
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0419,to be now and this is where we're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0420,probably going to be for the foreseeable
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0421,future whether that's three years for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0422,five years or seven years but that we
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0423,both agree that we don't want to raise
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0424,kids here and like live here forever but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0425,I also know that that's tough when
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0426,there's not a like it I wish that there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0427,were a scenario where I could say it's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0428,going to take me five years to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0429,accomplish XYZ that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0430,anywhere and I'll just fly over
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0431,everybody even that sort of thing but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0432,you know we know the best reality
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0433,situation I guess that's why how's it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0434,Asami
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0435,yeah alright what privileges do you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0436,think well recently but other than being
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0437,me is generally generally like what to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0438,take for granted I mean just I guess
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0439,within I feel like I'm talking about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0440,like comedy specifically but you know I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0441,get really frustrated with going to your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0442,shows mostly because I get frustrated
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0443,with many comedy specifically and I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0444,think that if we're talking like this I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0445,think I think that you erased me to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0446,family where you were brought up to be
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0447,very conscious and conscientious person
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0448,about gender and your sister and mother
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0449,and father are very smart people who I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0450,think are very aware of the way they
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0451,raised you to drew people home I go to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0452,shows I get really frustrated because I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0453,see a lot of like 95% guys and then
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0454,you're out of the show as always like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0455,the girl talking about like the period
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0456,jokes and her moves and so it's been
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0457,tough for me to like go your shows
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0458,because I then complain to you after
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0459,about like the discrepancies in comedy
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0460,where it's like all you know 150 men
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0461,doing this and then one woman doing this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0462,and then it's like why because just
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0463,numbers-wise it's a tie or side to man
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0464,versus and then I mean that's how for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0465,you just to say we like travel on your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0466,own
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0467,yeah but I don't know I don't think you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0468,specifically take a lot of things for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0469,granted I don't know you don't really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0470,walk around like some man's shirt man
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0471,you know like there's some guys just on
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0472,one of this and you know exactly who I'm
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0473,talking about the way I'm talking about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0474,these has to be well because I I could
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0475,not be engaged to someone who was this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0476,stereotypical tango guy who was the rich
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0477,leave information maybe just a person of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0478,certain race of a certain class who
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0479,works a certain job with warship types
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0480,of gloves that fins or a really certain
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0481,stereotype person yeah yeah and you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0482,don't exert yourself like that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0483,yeah good
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0484,that's your earliest political memory I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0485,mean I think the first thing that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0486,really remember being aware of was the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0487,Lewinsky thing because I was like 10 and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0488,that was all anybody talked about for a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0489,year and so I don't think it was ever
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0490,really explained to me what that like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0491,what exactly was going on absolutely
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0492,never enough that my parents didn't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0493,really feel like tackling the oral sex
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0494,is there anything oral sex conversation
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0495,I don't think that happens with kissing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0496,parents
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0497,conversation yeah so I don't know that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0498,you know because it's hard to really be
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0499,politically aware as a little kid other
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0500,than like knowing that important things
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0501,happen in the world like I remember when
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0502,the Oklahoma City bombing things like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0503,that that's more world something in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0504,politics but yeah Clinton is the first
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0505,president that I remember distinctly and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0506,we you know my parents were both
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0507,Democrats and so they liked Clinton but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0508,they're also fairly I think wasn't prude
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0509,but they're pretty traditional and so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0510,one thing with what was he happy I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0511,they were very this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0512,like well he's just confirming what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0513,we've all thought about politics for you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0514,know all the time basically this even
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0515,before that you kind of got the vibe
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0516,from him then he was this like very
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0517,slick talking kind of like smarmy guy
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0518,who he knew he was very meticulous with
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0519,how he was talking to people and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0520,somebody pulling on running so it was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0521,hard going to the 90s was nice because
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0522,everything was going so well you know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0523,but I feel like I've said this to you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0524,before I think the nineties were like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0525,our version of the 50s it was this time
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0526,that everybody was back on now like I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0527,say the best time I heard was making
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0528,those money and it was the best choice
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0529,and there's always a and weird feeling
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0530,around nostalgia when you grow up yeah I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0531,think politically that's the first thing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0532,that I really remember and then
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0533,obviously the defining moment of my
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0534,childhood is 9/11 which I mean it's hard
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0535,to not enter to find out of politics I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0536,mean that was my fourth day of high
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0537,school and I lived in New Jersey so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0538,there were people who knew people who
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0539,were there and I think that's the first
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0540,time I really like took an interest in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0541,what was going out of the world because
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0542,you couldn't ignore it anymore
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0543,like I still remember the day after that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0544,happened when we were in homeroom and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0545,they had us do the Pledge of Allegiance
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0546,and nobody could get through it like it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0547,makes me choked up now think about this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0548,is something you've recited since you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0549,were five without ever thinking about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0550,the context of it and then all of a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0551,sudden that we got this different
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0552,meaning so yeah I think that probably is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0553,the whiskey thing and then obviously
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0554,the world change living how do you think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0555,I was influenced by growing up as a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0556,first-generation American and what would
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0557,you change
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0558,I don't that means what what I change is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0559,that for me maybe I'm s to myself doing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0560,it well well how do you think I was I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0561,was influenced by growing I was the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0562,first generation in America well I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0563,that one of the interesting things about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0564,talking to your dad and listening to him
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0565,and just sort of watching him obviously
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0566,you know me I know most of my life like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0567,observing people and if I can do mostly
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0568,observing and less talking I'm a happier
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0569,person but watching your dad he's a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0570,really fascinating guy he's always
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0571,thinking about ways that he can better
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0572,himself save money and help you guys and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0573,I think those are three qualities that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0574,you have taken in and that he's not your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0575,mom as well and I think that we're gonna
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0576,happen potentially in the hallway family
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0577,like I did yeah not that my parents
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0578,didn't instill some of those qualities
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0579,but thinking about money and the ways
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0580,that he does not you know a thing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0581,we think about like if my mom wants to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0582,buy something it's like did it let's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0583,imagine I absolutely machine buy better
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0584,polar opposites in terms of you know she
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0585,doesn't really think about what she's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0586,spending her what she's spending it on
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0587,whereas my dad completely invest you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0588,know when you grow up with nothing I see
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0589,then you go one of two directions you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0590,either over adult everybody and buy all
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0591,the things that you wish you could have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0592,had or you go in his direction which is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0593,being so overly frugal that you can't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0594,even fully enjoy the money that you've
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0595,made and it kind of I mean he's occupied
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0596,like he's what almost six years old and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0597,I don't think a day goes by where he
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0598,doesn't think about money in some
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0599,capacity and it's because of growing up
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0600,that way and I feel badly for him
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0601,sometimes because he's done such amazing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0602,things for himself in America and he has
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0603,a very comfortable life but I don't know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0604,that he ever can fully appreciate that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0605,yeah but I think not that you're not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0606,appreciative of what you have but when
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0607,you have a dad like I do who came from
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0608,nothing in other stands what it means to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0609,like kind of place yourself up by the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0610,bootstraps I think that's been a good
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0611,example for me in terms of not taking
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0612,comfort for granted necessarily after I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0613,do but just knowing what he went through
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0614,it kind of is a motivating factor to not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0615,be lazy
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0616,yeah
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0617,how do you think my political views have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0618,affected my relationship with my family
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0619,well I I perceive you as somebody who
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0620,you agree with me on those things in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0621,terms of life
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0622,ideologically you know you think there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0623,should be probably more control over
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0624,your choice that's like the world I have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0625,a lot of important issues but I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0626,that you are more disillusioned with
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0627,politics that I am like I'm more
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0628,inclined to get behind somebody like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0629,Obama or that sort of thing we're in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0630,it's going well they're all kind of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0631,crappy what do you think that's an
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0632,accurate thing to say I mean I don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0633,know if I'd go that far to say they're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0634,all kind of crappy but but then I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0635,you're I think you have it sometimes you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0636,get frustrated with just how the system
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0637,is I get frustrated with media
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0638,portrayals generally of all politics
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0639,regardless of party like I get
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0640,frustrated with the fact that you know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0641,Hillary Clinton wait and Jeb Bush sad
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0642,today are things that people well in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0643,terms of your relationship with your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0644,family I think because of the fact that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0645,your mom is so like super right wing you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0646,have had to make a conscious decision as
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0647,a SMI especially to just let a lot of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0648,stuff kind of let a lot of stuff go
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0649,because it's not worth having the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0650,argument or saying what are you talking
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0651,about that's not true when you know that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0652,you not necessarily changed somebody's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0653,viewpoint because I think I mean I don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0654,know is your dad is he registered as a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0655,Republican I think actually like my dad
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0656,may be even more Republican than my mom
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0657,just not a cycle
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0658,last focus like my mom was willing to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0659,engage and just all our screaming
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0660,matches as we both yeah well know about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0661,her beliefs luckily this past year she's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0662,told that a little bit down from some of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0663,the viewpoints that she's had but if you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0664,get dad talking he's pretty right-wing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0665,in a lot of his viewpoints you know and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0666,especially this way or this way and you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0667,know on the moral side of things as well
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0668,but I think technically a might even a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0669,registered Republican because when I was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0670,able to register to vote my parents told
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0671,me that was all the only choice that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0672,had was to register you know as I didn't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0673,know that you didn't have to I really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0674,didn't like so I got to the place where
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0675,you go to vote to go vote for Obama and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0676,I like in the product brother you were
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0677,in either and I didn't realize that you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0678,couldn't vote for anyone in the front so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0679,that was a little bit of a black down to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0680,kind of like I feel like you whatever
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0681,opinions your parents have you've been
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0682,able to separate that from forming your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0683,own opinions well luckily I mean I went
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0684,to after high school because going to a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0685,Catholic High School you have so many
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0686,viewpoints pushed on to your entire life
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0687,you know if you go to a Catholic Mass
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0688,every single Wednesday and you would
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0689,amass on Sunday then you have people
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0690,telling you exactly what you need to do
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0691,then you have the bishop coming and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0692,saying hey
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0693,came from an anti-gay marriage
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0694,commercial isn't that great like you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0695,just grow up with these viewpoints
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0696,shoved in your face and so when I went
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0697,to college I had anthropology I had
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0698,gender studies I had I mean liberal arts
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0699,college yeah there were so many other
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0700,options
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0701,and so I guess I took the opposite route
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0702,and said I'm just going to do it exactly
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0703,against everything that I've been told
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0704,to do and try to just learn everything I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0705,possibly can about what else exists not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0706,follow everything I've been told to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0707,learn and just go the opposite way
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0708,you think that has more to do with kind
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0709,of rebelling against the education that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0710,you had whether climate that were more
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0711,about your parents or I think it has to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0712,do with me wanting to hope that more
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0713,exists than what people are saying
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0714,because their viewpoints yeah it'd be so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0715,sad for me if all that existed was what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0716,people sat on base so if all that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0717,existed was like nope any people are
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0718,back down and story like that right and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0719,like that's all people learned growing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0720,up so I think that was my goal of in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0721,going to college was only take classes
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0722,that were like absolutely I took classes
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0723,and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0724,I take classes and moods at my tech
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0725,classes like in every single other
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0726,religion that Catholicism just because I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0727,did not want to learn anything that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0728,had learned before she was really mad
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0729,mad that you were learning that for me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0730,to learn things that she didn't think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0731,were useful in any way wasn't what she
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0732,thought they were useful as she didn't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0733,want you taking class about Islam or
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0734,this or that but also that like when I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0735,told them I was getting a degree in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0736,gender studies that was like the world
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0737,was ending like how could I was spending
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0738,almost a quarter million dollars on a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0739,college education where I would never in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0740,a million years get a job or be thought
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0741,of as an intelligent person right like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0742,I'm not a lawyer a doctor I'm not like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0743,going to run the world because I can
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0744,only think about culture like oh god
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0745,yeah when you but when it comes up like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0746,now now with your parents obviously but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0747,someone says I go what you majored in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0748,college I saw big laughter I got laughs
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0749,yeah so what do you feel like you have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0750,to explain yourself yes no I remember
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0751,that but somebody today said oh that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0752,makes my politics degree sound like I'm
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0753,a genius and I was like I'm at work oh
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0754,yeah thinking I had your dick but in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0755,real life I was like I probably know a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0756,lot more about culture race religion and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0757,how to talk about them in a way that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0758,doesn't piss people off but also isn't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0759,to PC yeah so like you can really just
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0760,go somewhere else like it doesn't matter
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0761,yeah that's a little off topic but I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0762,think that that way of being able to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0763,shape how I talk about things too and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0764,walk that really fine line between
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0765,pissing my mom off angry my dad and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0766,still believing in what I want to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0767,believe in has been a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0768,Yeah right I think the biggest bail for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0769,you or anybody who majors in gender
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0770,studies as a woman is for people to not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0771,just assume you're someone like raving
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0772,feminist two things all men are equal
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0773,because I think that's not to see what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0774,people think about gender studies well I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0775,think that's what that questionnaire I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0776,felt like you know I don't you know I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0777,don't think that there's necessarily
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0778,like a set person and I think that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0779,walked into a lot of stereotypes when I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0780,was in college to playing hockey being
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0781,Gender Studies major being for main you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0782,know just being athletic in general you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0783,know there's a lot of different
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0784,stereotypes about you like - so are you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0785,concerned that I won't be able to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0786,provide health care for the family my
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0787,job which is a good thing because I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0788,didn't yeah yeah well luckily I work for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0789,employee benefits company so the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0790,benefits are actually a great so I don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0791,actually think in today's world that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0792,really matters who's you know getting
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0793,the we talk about this it's like we kind
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0794,of make high five that if one year
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0795,you're making a ton of money then that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0796,awesome if the next year I'm making in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0797,time I need that's awesome yeah if it's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0798,because I have a full-time job we're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0799,getting covered with healthcare that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0800,awesome so no I'm not worried good I'll
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0801,provide
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0802,how do you think that political system
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0803,has failed us you or me well I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0804,there's so little bipartisanship that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0805,it's just I mean I was saying bias that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0806,somebody who's an Obama supporter but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0807,the amount that the Republican Senate
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0808,has blocked everything that he's trying
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0809,to do even at the expense of benefiting
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0810,the American people just to promote a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0811,certain agenda it's really troubling to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0812,me so you know I think I'm not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0813,necessarily somebody who has any
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0814,delusions that one president is going to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0815,make everything great one person is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0816,gonna make everything horrible but I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0817,think there's so much bickering at this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0818,point that there's not really a lot
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0819,that's been accomplished I don't really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0820,know how how that changes obviously I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0821,don't know what do you think I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0822,definitely have to agree with you as
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0823,Steven reading daily even with the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0824,Supreme Court being at a floor floor
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0825,traveling without holding things up they
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0826,were I was reading that with them at
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0827,tides turning into that said that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0828,nothing will pass technicality and well
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0829,every other moment suggests will be shot
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0830,down yeah ice that bipartisanship is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0831,really what and here's me a lot like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0832,that so there's a lot of awesome you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0833,know people from me like Olympia Snowe
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0834,who you know left politics because of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0835,bipartisanship like it was so angering
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0836,that she would she left and she was in I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0837,think for 18 years and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0838,and it's women like that but I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0839,politics needs and I think when people
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0840,get so mired with AI Republic and I need
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0841,to believe this and I'm a Democrat I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0842,need to believe this and you can't see
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0843,anywhere in the mill thousand it's so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0844,dangerous like and people aren't even
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0845,willing to say I call somewhere in the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0846,middle because there's no candidate
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0847,that's all smart right yeah I think well
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0848,that's why I'm gonna do it on these two
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0849,and Leno or whatever we're they would
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0850,literally read people quotes from the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0851,other candidates and attributed to you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0852,know some of those like Obama versus
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0853,McCain they say like well Barack Obama
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0854,said blah blah blah even if it was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0855,McCain club and the person would be like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0856,oh no that's ridiculous even if they
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0857,said they were McCain supporter you know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0858,anything like people they all they it's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0859,a very black and white and I think that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0860,I mean that's why I think you've so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0861,similar quizzes up saying like just what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0862,are the issue that you care about and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0863,what do you believe and then we're going
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0864,to tell you who your most aligned with
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0865,politically and so that way you're not
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0866,just saying oh well I agree with that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0867,because it's Hillary and I think that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0868,ridiculous because Ted Cruz even though
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0869,I probably would be saying hey Lenny why
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0870,do you think people are so ill-informed
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0871,or missing Park develop so much like why
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0872,you think those like hey what do you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0873,think about this like those always do so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0874,well on the streets that was a dumb
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0875,people yeah yeah like I was reading
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0876,today like people were saying oh I'm so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0877,upset that my federal income tax is so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0878,high with like forty four percent of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0879,people don't you pay federal income tax
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0880,yeah like you're upset and fifty six
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0881,percent
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0882,that's you know well in a year and over
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0883,now of comments sections being the way
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0884,people communicate it's just a sound
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0885,ring also a lot outraged about something
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0886,people really don't know three people
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0887,like it and so all of a sudden gives you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0888,this ego boost
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0889,three people support your idiotic claims
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0890,and so all of a sudden you're on your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0891,massive soapbox with your political
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0892,beliefs so I just think it's dangerous
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0893,when people get out of it those tanks
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0894,and riots
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0895,yeah I think that I mean to your right
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0896,there there's no most interesting and I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0897,don't know I guess is putting in more
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0898,people than on politicians themselves
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0899,but when people have that mindset of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0900,like well this is a party online with so
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0901,everything they say is the gospel and no
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0902,logic from the other side will even
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0903,enter my brain I think that's that could
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0904,be kind of dangerous so sort of office
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0905,is on there but with I think a lot of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0906,the theme of this election with Bernie
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0907,Sanders itself is great you know how
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0908,super PACs and a lot of money has been a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0909,driving force like do you think that has
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0910,been well people have talked about what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0911,if they disallowed that from happening
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0912,what if they said you cannot take that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0913,kind of money everything has to be
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0914,funded based on like you all have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0915,essentially the same allotment for your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0916,campaign it's the same way that you know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0917,when you lost an Oh Jay show it wasn't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0918,the problem was that the legal system is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0919,unfair when one person can have a lawyer
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0920,that there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0921,the other person has a public defender
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0922,it's not going to be fair so of course
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0923,in politics that give somebody who has a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0924,ton of support financially from super
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0925,PACs and from all these supporters right
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0926,you're it's going to be very hard to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0927,compete with that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0928,for examines trying to use that to his
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0929,advantage saying like look I'm not like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0930,everybody else in taking all these
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0931,handouts I'm raising money getting small
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0932,donations on but yeah I think it would I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0933,think it would probably be better and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0934,obviously even people who get a lot of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0935,money I think it would be a lot less
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0936,stressful for them also so they could
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0937,focus on the things that you care about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0938,rather than trying to curry favor from a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0939,bunch of people who have deep pockets
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0940,that's one of what scares you the most
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0941,these days I think the fact we talk
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0942,about this but what scares me the most
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0943,is the direction of this country is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0944,heading in without a true and clear
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0945,definition of where the leadership is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0946,going you know and people are saying
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0947,yeah it's going to be Hillary and Trump
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0948,at the end and that's you know find her
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0949,the people who believe in both but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0950,that's still a little scary for me and I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0951,think that having an unclear path and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0952,such a bipartisan druing and also it's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0953,really scary that Trump has made it this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0954,far that's what really scares me it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0955,scares me that so many people in this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0956,nation can believe in a guy like that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0957,but at least we live in a place where
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0958,there is the checks and balances you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0959,know anything he's not going to be
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0960,Korean from yeah but I guess the thing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0961,about it that I cover in violence
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0962,is was my life significantly different
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0963,when george w bush was president versus
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0964,when Obama was president but I think it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0965,would be different if Travis Rosen
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0966,probably because I I think that we can
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0967,look back in 50 years
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0968,don't forget cruising he's almost I'm
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0969,gonna try to reverse a lot of things but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0970,I think that we'll look back in 50 or
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0971,100 years people could agree with this
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0972,or not disagree with this turnout but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0973,fifty or hundred years Bush and Obama I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0974,think will be looked up in history books
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0975,as you know good press hence yeah but I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0976,think that if Trump was president it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0977,would be a disaster yeah it would be a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0978,worldwide disaster it's just kind of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0979,like a mockery and that's so scary
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0980,yeah because when you when you hear
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0981,about plans or attempts at plans like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0982,destroying the Middle East building wall
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0983,but that is scary
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0984,how do you bring a child into the world
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0985,with things like that being said with
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0986,the quote where he said if I don't win
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0987,I'm not threatening violence but it may
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0988,happen like notice yeah he's a time
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0989,Cleveland like right that's a real thing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0990,that you say and he's like taunting
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0991,these white people to say like let's go
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0992,be violent against people that don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0993,vote for us that's insane that's a very
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0994,dangerous world that we are living like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0995,that's not I mean I think but again I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0996,think whoever whoever's in charge think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0997,that's scary now it's just the capacity
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0998,for like random acts of mass violence
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_0999,until that will be terrorism it can be
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1000,like in terms of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1001,but the fact that you can have seemingly
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1002,a safe plan for your day where I'm going
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1003,to get up and take a shower or go to the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1004,movies and you could get shot there like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1005,that's not how it always was so that but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1006,I also think that on the other side that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1007,you can't just live your life and that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1008,what we always try setting them on like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1009,what I'm gonna talk about living in New
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1010,York you can't live your life not riding
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1011,the drink and you can't live your life
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1012,not going to work you can't live your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1013,life afraid of absolutely everything
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1014,because anything could happen
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1015,how do you function they're just yeah
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1016,you'd be crippled is their life so what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1017,issues do you wish I cared about more
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1018,and why I think you do really that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1019,like a Syria you lack the like you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1020,really do well that's not yeah okay I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1021,think I feel like there are times where
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1022,I wish I cared about stuff more in terms
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1023,of actually like it's easy to talk about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1024,like oh I feel this very feel that way
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1025,but I don't know that either was really
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1026,do a lot about it other than having a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1027,conversation about it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1028,but I also don't know that I want to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1029,make that effort I feel like well there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1030,are some things
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1031,I feel like I just get enraged about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1032,yeah and I feel like you haven't like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1033,studied up because like I do a lot of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1034,reading during the week on the subway
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1035,and I'll just get really angry about at
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1036,the time but then when I realized that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1037,you don't or haven't read about them
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1038,either I'll just like forget about them
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1039,or drop them like what sort like a lot
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1040,of the things are just things going on
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1041,in the world or my celebrity gossip that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1042,I love dearly like I don't know I can't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1043,think about anything specifically but
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1044,usually why I bring things out hold on a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1045,sec we're getting down to the end here
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1046,how you doing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1047,Carmela yeah
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1048,we're you guys filming stuff out there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1049,for this - or different job
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1050,she helped
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1051,help ya
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1052,I can promote this car if it's Darius
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1053,how do you think that what parents
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1054,vehicle Jews have affected our
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1055,relationship of what would you change I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1056,think probably my parents have so I know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1057,that you get frustrated with the way
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1058,that my parents are such that comes
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1059,across with her political views I don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1060,think it's truly like beginning it may
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1061,have in some ways affected I don't know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1062,if I would change it this is my mom's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1063,works yeah it hasn't because of the fact
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1064,that they believe even all but all for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1065,been in the same room months oh right
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1066,yeah
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1067,that wasn't bad well it was fine but I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1068,mean the thing is if they lived in the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1069,same town and we had the opportunity for
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1070,them to get together every two weeks I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1071,don't know that that would necessarily
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1072,be a great thing but I think that in the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1073,capacity that it is now which is they
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1074,communicate through us largely and see
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1075,each other for you know our wedding and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1076,important events and that sort of thing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1077,I think everyone will be cool
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1078,who sacrifices more in our relationship
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1079,and why I mean I think just objectively
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1080,you've made more sacrifices than I have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1081,a necessity in that when we've been
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1082,together you know for a year and a half
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1083,long distance and I was here just by the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1084,nature of the situation I didn't have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1085,the flexibility to say all right well
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1086,I'm going to come to you although to me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1087,so you know I think that is the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1088,number-one thing the fact that you were
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1089,willing to leave replaced you live
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1090,literally your entire life to being an
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1091,absolutely new environment I don't think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1092,I can really equal that in any way but I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1093,think that I try to do a good job of I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1094,guess maybe smaller things or at least
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1095,listening to you or listening to your
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1096,point of view on stuff when there's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1097,something that's more important to you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1098,or something that would help Plagueis
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1099,alleviate some of the loneliness or what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1100,but no I mean when wouldn't the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1101,situation presented itself to move to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1102,where we are on Bay Ridge now and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1103,initially when you brought it up I was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1104,very I don't say dismiss it but I was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1105,very insistent that I wanted to stay in
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1106,Astoria because I liked it and I was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1107,comfortable there and I knew people you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1108,know I was friends with come to their
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1109,level but but I think that when I took a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1110,step back and realized what you were
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1111,asking of me versus what I had asked of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1112,you it wasn't even close so for me to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1113,say like no you have to live in the city
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1114,but also the one part of the one borough
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1115,that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1116,it would have been really unreasonable
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1117,and so when things like that come up or
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1118,even I mean we joke about the idea of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1119,getting a dog or something I've got the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1120,guy I understand that the reality of the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1121,situation is that I don't necessarily
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1122,have a ton of friends that I see often
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1123,but all of my family and friends are
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1124,much closer to me than yours are to you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1125,and I know that that's really hard and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1126,so even though I never imagined getting
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1127,a dog how you when something like that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1128,comes up I don't just think of it that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1129,black and white like do I want a dog
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1130,doing that one
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1131,it's what would it mean to you and would
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1132,it be something that would like improve
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1133,your quality of life quite obviously and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1134,happiness because of the fact that I've
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1135,had to ask a lot of people I think it is
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1136,like an even sacrificing obviously on
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1137,that at the beginning moving down here
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1138,was similarly a lot and I need you a lot
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1139,of my friends and especially like my
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1140,family probably even still to this day
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1141,some of my pen looks like why you why
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1142,did you move to New York I stood and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1143,kept that with you and know that I love
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1144,you and that we're getting married to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1145,get all the bad stuff from like moving
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1146,to New York
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1147,when clearly I'm so in love with the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1148,idea of Maine seems like there's crazy
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1149,idea like oh yeah you wouldn't you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1150,wouldn't have moved I mean they're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1151,planning actually there's plenty people
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1152,who live in Maine and always want to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1153,live the city of theirs so they went to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1154,Boston to New York whatever but they're
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1155,like that's not it's right but that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1156,you envision for yourself yeah anything
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1157,happen that we say would have been
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1158,easier definitely I was gonna go there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1159,anyways so go deal with this guy but I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1160,don't think that I don't think you want
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1161,to pay that sacrifice if what we had was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1162,wasn't worth because that's a huge thing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1163,to do yeah and I think that at the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1164,beginning way of beginning we both
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1165,sacrificed a lot like all those trips
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1166,driving to each other in what was ours
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1167,are mega buses mega bus yeah I mean
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1168,that's the certainly for the first year
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1169,and a half it was a lot of sacrifice
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1170,both ways in terms of just literally the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1171,logistics of it you know to make it work
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1172,to see each other at least once a month
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1173,which is what we tried to do that meant
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1174,that you or I we're going to have to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1175,drive or take a series of buses eight
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1176,hours to see each other and I think that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1177,from the beginning was the reflection of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1178,the fact that what we had going out was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1179,worth all that effort because we would
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1180,have been insane to go through that if
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1181,it was just for something like casual
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1182,sort of thing
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1183,if you have a daughter what do you hope
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1184,will be different for her in the future
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1185,as a woman
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1186,I hope that if I have a daughter that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1187,chelonian have to think about the fact
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1188,that she would be different from son if
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1189,that makes sense yeah
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1190,she wouldn't even have to think about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1191,the fact that being a Gender Studies
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1192,major would be different than being a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1193,pre-law student that she would have to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1194,think about meeting 75 cents on the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1195,dollar to like stupid things like that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1196,that people bring up every time they
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1197,think about gender disability that's a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1198,big it's a big deal and I really hope
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1199,that that type of thing is something
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1200,that she never even has to think about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1201,yeah like she could just grow up and do
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1202,whatever the hell she wants and not have
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1203,to think about who she wants to do it
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1204,what patterns you wants to use what
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1205,religion she wants to be if she wants to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1206,you know go to college or not go to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1207,college whatever like I think that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1208,like my biggest goal it's just to allow
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1209,my daughter's son whatever genders child
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1210,I have just allowing them to really be
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1211,whoever they wanted me because I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1212,that if you don't and I think a little
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1213,bit of this was on me and I luckily grew
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1214,the other way but I see and I I saw a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1215,lot of kids that grew into a very
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1216,horrible like militaristic and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1217,uneducated version of a person because
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1218,they were told what they were supposed
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1219,to be I think that that isn't healthy
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1220,and so I'm just hoping to not tell
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1221,anyone what to do other than keep them
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1222,safe yeah yeah
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1223,what you hope I've learned from you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1224,today both of us well I mean again I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1225,think we have a pretty transparent
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1226,relationship and so I don't know that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1227,necessarily came into tonight thinking
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1228,that I was gonna have some sort of you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1229,know bombshell discovery about something
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1230,that you and I had done
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1231,but I hope that it's apparent to you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1232,that these are things that I think about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1233,even if I don't localize that verbalize
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1234,that you know that if you ever feel like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1235,I'm not conscious of the sacrifices that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1236,you've made or I'm not aware of the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1237,things that are important to you or the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1238,things that you hope for us in the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1239,future that that's something that I'm
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1240,kind of always thinking about even if
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1241,I'm not specifically talking about it or
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1242,thinking about it that whole which I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1243,hope that you know that but you know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1244,it's not something that we always say
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1245,like all right well for the next 15
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1246,minutes let's talk about our future it's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1247,just stuff that we've kind of brought up
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1248,at various times and then three plus
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1249,years we've been together I didn't know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1250,I could stare at you for this long now I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1251,feel like we don't really talk that much
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1252,about political things like I think when
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1253,we finally get to spend time together
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1254,because it seems not like Rare but like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1255,kind of opportunity sort of just spend
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1256,that time together catch up on the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1257,things that happen in the day and don't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1258,really want to get weighed down by
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1259,political things or like when I because
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1260,I kind of get worked up because I just
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1261,don't like when people
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1262,and so I guess it was nice getting to
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1263,hear you you know talk a little bit
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1264,about some of your opinions about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1265,side-eye I think I started realized that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1266,we do agree on them nothing in the class
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1267,we agree but I think we actually agree a
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1268,lot more than I thought that yeah I mean
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1269,I kind of wonder how people have strong
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1270,relationships when they don't agree on
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1271,like fundamental things you know I was
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1272,worried going into this that we were and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1273,I like disagree on political things like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1274,I was the ring there are some things
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1275,that we that we do disagree on that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1276,think if you mean that we were just whoa
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1277,that's like a huge bombshell I'm like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1278,didn't know you loved Trump today like
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1279,that would have been like a big thing I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1280,would have learned but you know I think
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1281,that a lot of this stuff that we on the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1282,basilar related group all right
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1283,do you think I'd make a good president
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1284,or political leader here Obama
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1285,impression on us I don't know honey
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1286,honestly I'm sorry listen uh yeah I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1287,think that you like pleasing a lot of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1288,people and that's a good thing but you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1289,also don't like letting people down and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1290,I think that to be a leader
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1291,unfortunately I have to let at least 50%
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1292,or 49% of people check so you may well
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1293,your dream job that way no I literally
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1294,agree I think I mean up still a kind of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1295,playful Arabic I find that that one
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1296,person doesn't like me I'm very
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1297,flustered I know and so we still know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1298,exactly who that person was it didn't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1299,like that one show three years ago I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1300,don't know yeah I don't think I have the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1301,stomach for any that stuff I think that
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1302,I'm also a very I try to be a very moral
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1303,person in the sense that if I've done
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1304,something that I feel like is wrong or
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1305,slated somebody I it really bothers me
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1306,yeah why do you love me so many reasons
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1307,I love you because everything has always
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1308,been really really easy it's been
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1309,everything about us is what people say
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1310,doesn't exist when people talk about
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1311,what an ideal relationship is it doesn't
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1312,mean that you have created 100% all the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1313,time on every single thing you talk
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1314,about but it's having that perfect
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1315,perfect mixture of friendship with
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1316,attraction with respect for somebody and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1317,I think that's in our entire
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1318,relationship as angers have been each
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1319,other and
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1320,time about big things whether it was you
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1321,being willing to move here or whether or
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1322,not think you're gonna work out there
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1323,was never a time that we cursed at each
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1324,other or said things that we can take
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1325,back and I think that that has laid the
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1326,groundwork for a really awesome life
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1327,together
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1328,and I think that it's just a level of
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1329,comfort than I have with you that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1330,haven't had with anybody else and that's
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1331,why even when we think about the future
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1332,none of that scares me because I know
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1333,that as long as you and I are doing all
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1334,that stuff together it's gonna be fine
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1335,yeah Cheers have any question any other
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1336,questions I popped up for that you want
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1337,to ask each other you're worried that I
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1338,cannot respond to that answer for all
Man006_Woman006_Transcription_1339,the same reasons at one plus one
