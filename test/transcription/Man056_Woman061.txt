Man056_Woman061_0009,this medical mission at all but someone
Man056_Woman061_0010,ended up convincing me and birthing it
Man056_Woman061_0011,was just a longest night of my life and
Man056_Woman061_0012,I got up and we hold in a foreign
Man056_Woman061_0013,country I didn't know anything that was
Man056_Woman061_0014,going on and then we then we took a bus
Man056_Woman061_0015,for like three hours to a remote city
Man056_Woman061_0016,called Puebla and I remember getting off
Man056_Woman061_0017,the bus and we made a whole bunch of
Man056_Woman061_0018,people and and I remember seeing you
Man056_Woman061_0019,about 30 feet and you were standing
Man056_Woman061_0020,standing at the door and I distinctly
Man056_Woman061_0021,remember that moment because I knew
Man056_Woman061_0022,something had changed and for some
Man056_Woman061_0023,reason I was very intimidated that why
Man056_Woman061_0024,you that's what it was so incredibly
Man056_Woman061_0025,intimidated by you actually thought you
Man056_Woman061_0026,were the boss or something like that I
Man056_Woman061_0027,remember that a couple were friends were
Man056_Woman061_0028,introducing each other and they were
Man056_Woman061_0029,introducing all the doctors in the
Man056_Woman061_0030,mission and you know they introduced you
Man056_Woman061_0031,and they introduced me and I was on the
Man056_Woman061_0032,other side of the circle and it wasn't
Man056_Woman061_0033,until one of our common friends was like
Man056_Woman061_0034,oh here you guys should meet each other
Man056_Woman061_0035,you stated your name and then you left
Man056_Woman061_0036,and then ten minutes later actually for
Man056_Woman061_0037,your name again and you thought it was
Man056_Woman061_0038,amazingly rude but I was I was I just
Man056_Woman061_0039,had ended an engagement like a year a
Man056_Woman061_0040,couple months before and I was bitter
Man056_Woman061_0041,and angry and I didn't want to meet
Man056_Woman061_0042,anyone and but I met you and I felt so
Man056_Woman061_0043,intimidated I felt like something had
Man056_Woman061_0044,happened something had changed so I
Man056_Woman061_0045,don't know if you want to count it the
Man056_Woman061_0046,official first time we met or oh I
Man056_Woman061_0047,remember that day we didn't even
Man056_Woman061_0048,exchange numbers or anything like that
Man056_Woman061_0049,right we just parted ways and I was
Man056_Woman061_0050,hanging out with some friends a week

Man056_Woman061_0057,met and this time we're actually
Man056_Woman061_0058,spending time together because there's
Man056_Woman061_0059,only six of us and you were walking on
Man056_Woman061_0060,the sidewalk and I was walking on the

Man056_Woman061_0099,the altar one of the moments that I'll
Man056_Woman061_0100,I'll remember forever first of all I I
Man056_Woman061_0101,knew I was nervous obviously clearly I
Man056_Woman061_0102,was really nervous

Man056_Woman061_0105,just like what's going on but there was
Man056_Woman061_0106,a point where at her wedding where my
Man056_Woman061_0107,parents never danced and it was the
Man056_Woman061_0108,first time my mom wore a dress then
Man056_Woman061_0109,there was a point that we were dancing

Man056_Woman061_0118,right
Man056_Woman061_0119,that yeah it took four years of us

Man056_Woman061_0122,had to do but it was a it was one of
Man056_Woman061_0123,those moments where I was looking across
Man056_Woman061_0124,I was looking at my parents I was like
Man056_Woman061_0125,looking at their example and realizing
Man056_Woman061_0126,that I was building that myself with you
Man056_Woman061_0127,and and that this was only the beginning
Man056_Woman061_0128,but I was able to see that I that that
Man056_Woman061_0129,we have a trajectory of people that that
Man056_Woman061_0130,really led by by example and how we can
Man056_Woman061_0131,do this oh my god you can't do this
Man056_Woman061_0132,forget statistics and it's not just hype
Man056_Woman061_0133,it's just a commitment and in the
Man056_Woman061_0134,understanding of the Covenant that we've

Man056_Woman061_0208,you're a delicate soul that you want to
Man056_Woman061_0209,know the innermost things about my life
Man056_Woman061_0210,and me and she it's like it takes a
Man056_Woman061_0211,while I like for me it's not just like

Man056_Woman061_0217,the door and just be like here's my
Man056_Woman061_0218,heart you know it's just like I gotta
Man056_Woman061_0219,settle down and if something's bothering
Man056_Woman061_0220,me I got to think

Man056_Woman061_0222,meditator that's so me absolutely but
Man056_Woman061_0223,when do I feel closest to you I I feel
Man056_Woman061_0224,closest to you here's one I feel closest
Man056_Woman061_0225,to you I feel like everything I've ever
Man056_Woman061_0226,wanted or I thought I ever wanted I had
Man056_Woman061_0227,I I wanted to go to college went to
Man056_Woman061_0228,college I wanted a doctorate ended up
Man056_Woman061_0229,becoming a doctor I wanted a post-grad
Man056_Woman061_0230,ended up going to Harvard I felt like
Man056_Woman061_0231,nothing was impossible I wanted to go
Man056_Woman061_0232,into consulting got into a top firm
Man056_Woman061_0233,nothing was impossible and then I think
Man056_Woman061_0234,there was a point where and this this
Man056_Woman061_0235,was happening when when we were living
Man056_Woman061_0236,we both lived in Mexico City you lived
Man056_Woman061_0237,in Pachuca and I was I was living in the
Man056_Woman061_0238,Four Seasons and I was staring out out
Man056_Woman061_0239,my window I mean I was thinking I got
Man056_Woman061_0240,everything I ever wanted but I don't
Man056_Woman061_0241,feel fulfilled I think it was it was
Man056_Woman061_0242,there that I started thinking more about
Man056_Woman061_0243,it however it was the beginning of our
Man056_Woman061_0244,relationship
Man056_Woman061_0245,I started thinking more about what I
Man056_Woman061_0246,what I wanted from life when it came to
Man056_Woman061_0247,a spouse no it was 27
Man056_Woman061_0248,I think after having all that and then I
Man056_Woman061_0249,felt like I lost it all and then we're
Man056_Woman061_0250,building it up again and I for some
Man056_Woman061_0251,reason I just feel closer to you when
Man056_Woman061_0252,you tell me you believe in me cus before
Man056_Woman061_0253,everything I wanted I I knew I could
Man056_Woman061_0254,work for and you I could get I knew I
Man056_Woman061_0255,could do it but I think I've lost some
Man056_Woman061_0256,of that along the way maybe it's life
Man056_Woman061_0257,maybe it's maturity maybe it's fear but
Man056_Woman061_0258,I feel closest to you when you tell me
Man056_Woman061_0259,you believe in me the truth is that's
Man056_Woman061_0260,really all I ever wanted in a spouse my
Man056_Woman061_0261,parents my brothers my family always
Man056_Woman061_0262,believed in me
Man056_Woman061_0263,not sure about people who I did it in
Man056_Woman061_0264,the past but I know for you that's what
Man056_Woman061_0265,made the difference you you stand apart
Man056_Woman061_0266,because you believe in me you actually
Man056_Woman061_0267,think I could do things things that
Man056_Woman061_0268,seemed impossible to me and then we
Man056_Woman061_0269,achieve them and then I'm just like okay
Man056_Woman061_0270,but I feel closest to you when when I
Man056_Woman061_0271,see a problem that to me it's huge and
Man056_Woman061_0272,to you it's like you can do it
Man056_Woman061_0273,and there the truth is for some reason I
Man056_Woman061_0274,kind of feel like I can and it's a
Man056_Woman061_0275,really cool feeling yeah it's a it's an
Man056_Woman061_0276,exceptional feeling honestly

Man056_Woman061_0747,but they love you so much of it and they
Man056_Woman061_0748,love you in a different way and for me
Man056_Woman061_0749,it was so hard to comprehend I was like
Man056_Woman061_0750,that
Man056_Woman061_0751,that doesn't make sense you know love is
Man056_Woman061_0752,when we all get together you know but
Man056_Woman061_0753,there's there's one thing that at first
Man056_Woman061_0754,I was just like man this is this is all
Man056_Woman061_0755,something's off here but it was one New
Man056_Woman061_0756,Year's or that New Year's I think it was
Man056_Woman061_0757,first year of dating that I spent over
Man056_Woman061_0758,with your family and your brother who is
Man056_Woman061_0759,literally he's like super wild he
Man056_Woman061_0760,wouldn't leave till he gave your dad a
Man056_Woman061_0761,hug because he want to be the first one
Man056_Woman061_0762,to hug your dad after the New Year's or
Man056_Woman061_0763,something like that I guess it was a
Man056_Woman061_0764,tradition or something
Man056_Woman061_0765,it was NATO and mind it's like 2:00 in
Man056_Woman061_0766,the morning I'm half asleep right but I
Man056_Woman061_0767,was really impacted by that because I
Man056_Woman061_0768,realized how is it that you guys show
Man056_Woman061_0769,love and it's like maybe it's not just
Man056_Woman061_0770,all the time but when you do you do it
Man056_Woman061_0771,in a genuine way and that's that's cool
Man056_Woman061_0772,that's really really cool it's just
Man056_Woman061_0773,learning to identify those moments where
Man056_Woman061_0774,or it's like oh this is how they're
Man056_Woman061_0775,loving them do you agree you don't yeah

Man056_Woman061_0891,absolutely absolutely I definitely I
Man056_Woman061_0892,agree with you on that I think I want to
Man056_Woman061_0893,make sure that my kids understand who
Man056_Woman061_0894,God is in our lives and who God is in
Man056_Woman061_0895,their lives and for them to make their
Man056_Woman061_0896,own choices but to know that God always
Man056_Woman061_0897,loves them and believes in them and it's
Man056_Woman061_0898,rooting for them and I think the best
Man056_Woman061_0899,way to do that is by how we communicate
Man056_Woman061_0900,in our marriage I think that I think
Man056_Woman061_0901,that's gonna be a prime example the way
Man056_Woman061_0902,yeah yeah I hope our kids get to see and
Man056_Woman061_0903,a godly example in our marriage that
