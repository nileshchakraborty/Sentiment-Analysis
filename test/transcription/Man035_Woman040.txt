Man035_Woman040_0007,umbilical cord and seeing you was like a
Man035_Woman040_0008,dream come true for me that you know I

Man035_Woman040_0016,oh my god what's your favorite memory
Man035_Woman040_0017,from childhood with me when we when you
Man035_Woman040_0018,took me to see Mallory oh I don't know
Man035_Woman040_0019,how old it I think it was like 8 and I
Man035_Woman040_0020,remember I had like a gymnastics
Man035_Woman040_0021,competition
Man035_Woman040_0022,I think the same day and I did choose
Man035_Woman040_0023,the mama Mia
Man035_Woman040_0024,or the competition and so we went and it
Man035_Woman040_0025,was the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Man035_Woman040_0026,you're like dragging me through the
Man035_Woman040_0027,crowd and it was so good the show and
Man035_Woman040_0028,then after like at the end they do like
Man035_Woman040_0029,the big number and you like pushed me
Man035_Woman040_0030,out into the aisle and I went right to
Man035_Woman040_0031,like the front where the stage was and I
Man035_Woman040_0032,remember one of like everyone looking
Man035_Woman040_0033,back at the audience and like everyone
Man035_Woman040_0034,was watching the show and like it's just
Man035_Woman040_0035,like just like captured by it and I look
Man035_Woman040_0036,at you when you're like looking at me
Man035_Woman040_0037,and just like smiling and I always
Man035_Woman040_0038,remember that when you look back at the
Man035_Woman040_0039,crowd and saw their reaction to the play
Man035_Woman040_0040,did you did that help influence your
Man035_Woman040_0041,decision that you wanted to be an
Man035_Woman040_0042,actress yeah I think whenever I see like
Man035_Woman040_0043,a live performance it just like ignites
Man035_Woman040_0044,that spark like just the feeling of just
Man035_Woman040_0045,I don't know I'm just being there and
Man035_Woman040_0046,like what it can do for people and the
Man035_Woman040_0047,joy it brings I think it always I don't
Man035_Woman040_0048,know reignite that fire it was a good
Man035_Woman040_0049,time it wasn't so frothy
Man035_Woman040_0050,when do you feel closest to me
Man035_Woman040_0051,well I feel close to you all the time
Man035_Woman040_0052,you and if you're not even if we're not
Man035_Woman040_0053,under the same roof I feel like there's
Man035_Woman040_0054,a connection no matter where you are I
Man035_Woman040_0055,just always feel connected but when
Man035_Woman040_0056,we're alone I mean I could feel close to
Man035_Woman040_0057,you for watching the Bachelorette for
Man035_Woman040_0058,the car coming down here I just feel
Man035_Woman040_0059,close like I don't it's weird like we
Man035_Woman040_0060,could be in the car and not talk but I
Man035_Woman040_0061,just feel like we're having a
Man035_Woman040_0062,conversation yeah no I actually was
Man035_Woman040_0063,thinking that the dad almost only creepy
Man035_Woman040_0064,you know so I just say we have like that
Man035_Woman040_0065,connection no I was actually thinking
Man035_Woman040_0066,that when we drove down like it was
Man035_Woman040_0067,silent but it was just like you didn't
Man035_Woman040_0068,have to really be talking to make it it
Man035_Woman040_0069,wasn't just not weird to me
Man035_Woman040_0070,so when I look in the mirror what do you
Man035_Woman040_0071,think is the first thing I criticize
Man035_Woman040_0072,well your weight and I think because
Man035_Woman040_0073,it's something we both struggle with and
Man035_Woman040_0074,still struggle with and probably always
Man035_Woman040_0075,will struggle with so I think that that
Man035_Woman040_0076,is something I don't know like one of
Man035_Woman040_0077,your demons that you still fight I think
Man035_Woman040_0078,that that's another reason also with the
Man035_Woman040_0079,back to the close question why I feel
Man035_Woman040_0080,really close to you is like you also
Man035_Woman040_0081,understand another part of me like the
Man035_Woman040_0082,stealing body image and yeah I think
Man035_Woman040_0083,that your weight maybe that one bald
Man035_Woman040_0084,spot what if I just took my shirt off
Man035_Woman040_0085,right now hmm why do you think I'm
Man035_Woman040_0086,beautiful for me I don't see your beauty

Man035_Woman040_0323,family backbone everywhere but seems
Man035_Woman040_0324,like the Midwest has a strong family
Man035_Woman040_0325,thing going on there and that would have
Man035_Woman040_0326,been a that would have been a good move
Man035_Woman040_0327,when you guys were little to move that
Man035_Woman040_0328,I'm in I mean I don't see me in the
Man035_Woman040_0329,Midwest that's the only thing I'm an
Man035_Woman040_0330,East Coast guy but to have you guys
Man035_Woman040_0331,around family a little bit more we mean
Man035_Woman040_0332,you guys basically grew up with our
Man035_Woman040_0333,family around you yeah that is weird
Man035_Woman040_0334,yeah no family I mean I'm lucky I got
Man035_Woman040_0335,friends you know and you know my friends
Man035_Woman040_0336,are like family you know what I mean and
Man035_Woman040_0337,their wives and stuff like that that
Man035_Woman040_0338,that all stepped up to the plate you
Man035_Woman040_0339,know what I mean even in you know
Man035_Woman040_0340,whether it was Jersey or you know up
Man035_Woman040_0341,here in Connecticut I mean they they all
Man035_Woman040_0342,you know but that's one thing I wish I
Man035_Woman040_0343,would have done is maybe raise you guys
Man035_Woman040_0344,around family there's nothing that like
Man035_Woman040_0345,you wish you had I just you know a
Man035_Woman040_0346,healthier lifestyle and I get back to
Man035_Woman040_0347,that again no I you know I don't have I
Man035_Woman040_0348,think they're like the way you were
Man035_Woman040_0349,raised you know I think there was a
Man035_Woman040_0350,pretty solid foundation the foundation
Man035_Woman040_0351,cracked you know as the years went on
Man035_Woman040_0352,but had a good you know I think you had
Man035_Woman040_0353,a pretty good upbringing yeah
Man035_Woman040_0354,how can I be a better father to you
Man035_Woman040_0355,[Music]
Man035_Woman040_0356,you're already amazing I want to be
Man035_Woman040_0357,better
Man035_Woman040_0358,[Music]
Man035_Woman040_0359,I think just by like example like I like
Man035_Woman040_0360,you I think that you could be a better
Man035_Woman040_0361,father by being like better to yourself
Man035_Woman040_0362,because like I watch you fall into your
Man035_Woman040_0363,habits and they're like you know like
Man035_Woman040_0364,not really you under in the career in
Man035_Woman040_0365,the car one time and I put up on the
Man035_Woman040_0366,mirror like this thing that says like
Man035_Woman040_0367,love yourself or something and you're
Man035_Woman040_0368,like you know I loved myself like I feel
Man035_Woman040_0369,like just like taking better care of
Man035_Woman040_0370,yourself like like like yeah
Man035_Woman040_0371,[Laughter]
Man035_Woman040_0372,I know what you're gonna say what do you
Man035_Woman040_0373,think is preventing me from becoming the
Man035_Woman040_0374,person I want to become
Man035_Woman040_0375,Wow that's a great question
Man035_Woman040_0376,I think you have a fear of success like
Man035_Woman040_0377,I think you see like like you don't want
Man035_Woman040_0378,to be happy because maybe people around
Man035_Woman040_0379,you aren't happy so it's kind of weird
Man035_Woman040_0380,roundabout way that that maybe you've
Man035_Woman040_0381,also be like I think part of you're
Man035_Woman040_0382,hesitant like pursue what you want to
Man035_Woman040_0383,pursue and do what you want to do I
Man035_Woman040_0384,think that a part of you sees like I'm
Man035_Woman040_0385,not happy what I'm doing and maybe I
Man035_Woman040_0386,didn't follow things that I wanted to do
Man035_Woman040_0387,and maybe you have a fear of in a crazy
Man035_Woman040_0388,way not not being successful doing what
Man035_Woman040_0389,you want to do I think that's kind of
Man035_Woman040_0390,holding holding your back I don't think
Man035_Woman040_0391,it's anything about anything else we
Man035_Woman040_0392,talked about I really feel like I don't
Man035_Woman040_0393,know if that sounds strange enough you
Man035_Woman040_0394,understand what I'm saying
Man035_Woman040_0395,yeah like self-sabotage self-sabotage
Man035_Woman040_0396,yeah I think it's maybe like partly that
Man035_Woman040_0397,and also just like like just like if
Man035_Woman040_0398,what if I like attempt it and then like
Man035_Woman040_0399,nothing comes out of it and then it's
Man035_Woman040_0400,all like I wasted so much time and
Man035_Woman040_0401,nothing came out of it or like like I
Man035_Woman040_0402,went to school for acting and everything
Man035_Woman040_0403,but then what if like I go or start like
Man035_Woman040_0404,attempting it and then I'm like I hate
Man035_Woman040_0405,this or like I'm not good and I'm never
Man035_Woman040_0406,gonna like I know but we had this
Man035_Woman040_0407,conversation before we had yet another
Man035_Woman040_0408,person in the family that you know paid
Man035_Woman040_0409,for them to go to school to be a child
Man035_Woman040_0410,psychologist that somebody in the family
Man035_Woman040_0411,had a mental breakdown now she's a
Man035_Woman040_0412,dental hygienist you understand yes sir
Man035_Woman040_0413,yeah whatever they call yeah so that's
Man035_Woman040_0414,what I mean it's you know but you gotta
Man035_Woman040_0415,I don't see me like you're more afraid
Man035_Woman040_0416,to be successful than you are to be a
Man035_Woman040_0417,failure that's what I feel you know what
Man035_Woman040_0418,I mean
Man035_Woman040_0419,so I don't that that hasn't stopped you
Man035_Woman040_0420,before I don't know what's holding you
Man035_Woman040_0421,back now like there's just something
Man035_Woman040_0422,that's got a grip on you that you can't
Man035_Woman040_0423,seem to let go you need to let go you
Man035_Woman040_0424,give a shit about the money or the
Man035_Woman040_0425,school I don't care about that kind of
Man035_Woman040_0426,stuff yeah I don't know you shouldn't be
Man035_Woman040_0427,feeling about that you should just you
Man035_Woman040_0428,know do it but it is also about money I
Man035_Woman040_0429,think because like I feel bad that you
Man035_Woman040_0430,have to like support me that's in your
Man035_Woman040_0431,head it's a parent's job really yep I
Man035_Woman040_0432,know but I'm your bridge to wherever
Man035_Woman040_0433,you're going you understand so you
Man035_Woman040_0434,should be taking advantage now all I
Man035_Woman040_0435,could do it okay what would you be doing
Man035_Woman040_0436,that heart attack was for real I was
Man035_Woman040_0437,dead what would you be doing myself you
Man035_Woman040_0438,know what I mean what would you be doing
Man035_Woman040_0439,if I wasn't you know I know I think
Man035_Woman040_0440,about that sometimes like I that scares
Man035_Woman040_0441,me a lot because like I have no idea
Man035_Woman040_0442,what I would be doing I know but you and
Man035_Woman040_0443,half the country that everybody in your
Man035_Woman040_0444,age people all everybody's floundering
Man035_Woman040_0445,till they find out what they want to do
Man035_Woman040_0446,but you got to try it to see - whew
Man035_Woman040_0447,that's right thing you need to like try
Man035_Woman040_0448,things or rule them out and then you
Man035_Woman040_0449,know instead of like you know could of
Man035_Woman040_0450,what it should have or you know you know
Man035_Woman040_0451,this is you know your time is now don't
Man035_Woman040_0452,like make a move and try something do
Man035_Woman040_0453,something with me
Man035_Woman040_0454,what do you think is the hardest thing
Man035_Woman040_0455,for me right now definitely being in a
Man035_Woman040_0456,place you don't want to be and like we
Man035_Woman040_0457,talked about this how you feel like like
Man035_Woman040_0458,you not I mean you work 80 hours a week
Man035_Woman040_0459,whatever it is you were crazy amounts of
Man035_Woman040_0460,a week at work and like you have to do
Man035_Woman040_0461,though be like for all the loans and
Man035_Woman040_0462,Luton and Lindsay going to school and
Man035_Woman040_0463,just like daily stuff and like it's not
Man035_Woman040_0464,like it's like work it's hard work

Man035_Woman040_0471,do you think is the hardest thing for me
Man035_Woman040_0472,right now
Man035_Woman040_0473,yeah so I think just being like feeling
Man035_Woman040_0474,like trapped in a sense cuz I don't
Man035_Woman040_0475,think any of us like Connecticut besides
Man035_Woman040_0476,I mean Lindsey has friends but I feel
Man035_Woman040_0477,like we all would rather be
Man035_Woman040_0478,Connecticut's beautiful it's nice there
Man035_Woman040_0479,it's just different you know what I mean
Man035_Woman040_0480,mines being malleable I was a malleable
Man035_Woman040_0481,everybody said you lived in mal yeah I
Man035_Woman040_0482,mean it's great place but just ya know I
Man035_Woman040_0483,mean I'm a Jersey guy yeah so like when
Man035_Woman040_0484,we're in Jersey like those are my people
Man035_Woman040_0485,my people yeah so I think that's I mean
Man035_Woman040_0486,Connecticut's been good to us I know
Man035_Woman040_0487,that's I mean it's been good to us got
Man035_Woman040_0488,great friends there it got great you
Man035_Woman040_0489,know a lot of good things happen in
Man035_Woman040_0490,there just it's not home I feel like
Man035_Woman040_0491,we're in like this limbo there because
Man035_Woman040_0492,like we've moved so much so like we're
Man035_Woman040_0493,here but I know we're not staying where
Man035_Woman040_0494,we're at like I know we're at least
Man035_Woman040_0495,moving two more times so it's like
Man035_Woman040_0496,we're like we still have things boxed up
Man035_Woman040_0497,and like you're sleeping on the couch

Man035_Woman040_0499,than us no I know but I'm just mean like

Man035_Woman040_0502,staying but we're like stuck kind of
Man035_Woman040_0503,right now I think that's what stuff is
Man035_Woman040_0504,you working mostly but the stability is
Man035_Woman040_0505,a little rocky look yeah and it's tough
Man035_Woman040_0506,also because a lot of people have to in
Man035_Woman040_0507,like in comes whereas like you're
Man035_Woman040_0508,supporting and you've been supporting me

Man035_Woman040_0549,I think I was why I'm always proud of
Man035_Woman040_0550,you but um I think when I think I don't
Man035_Woman040_0551,know what maybe like last year I don't
Man035_Woman040_0552,know maybe like two years ago or
Man035_Woman040_0553,something I don't know hey let me keep
Man035_Woman040_0554,bringing this up like it was really feel
Man035_Woman040_0555,like okay but when you were really like
Man035_Woman040_0556,taking care of yourself I was really
Man035_Woman040_0557,proud of you like you went to the gym
Man035_Woman040_0558,everyday and we were eating good and we
Man035_Woman040_0559,both lost like pretty good amount of
Man035_Woman040_0560,weight and you seemed like just the
Man035_Woman040_0561,happiest you've been I think we're in
Man035_Woman040_0562,Connecticut I think it was Berek hell-oh
Man035_Woman040_0563,when we bring up like the five mile hill
Man035_Woman040_0564,we didn't know it so probably like then
Man035_Woman040_0565,when you just were like taking time to
Man035_Woman040_0566,be well and care for yourself and put in
Man035_Woman040_0567,that time and effort that you put into
Man035_Woman040_0568,everyone else around you like you were
Man035_Woman040_0569,for once like taking care of yourself
Man035_Woman040_0570,and I think like it was really inspiring
Man035_Woman040_0571,for me like seeing you do it I was like
Man035_Woman040_0572,well I can do it you know yeah I just
Man035_Woman040_0573,want to see you like so uncomfortable
Man035_Woman040_0574,now to sit here talk about like a couple
Man035_Woman040_0575,years ago I would really you know we're
Man035_Woman040_0576,into them to care of ourselves and yeah
Man035_Woman040_0577,a couple years later why did we stay
Man035_Woman040_0578,with it I don't know that's our problem
Man035_Woman040_0579,like why can't we ever like we always
Man035_Woman040_0580,ask why Germans book he talks about that
Man035_Woman040_0581,hitting that plateau I'm telling you
Man035_Woman040_0582,that was a key thing when I read its key
Man035_Woman040_0583,thing yeah but we both have always like
Man035_Woman040_0584,this is where I like I'm following your
Man035_Woman040_0585,footsteps we're like we will be like for
Man035_Woman040_0586,a good amount of time be like really
Man035_Woman040_0587,healthy working out lose a bunch of
Man035_Woman040_0588,weight and then something happens and we
Man035_Woman040_0589,just stopped and then we go back to
Man035_Woman040_0590,everywhere or more
Man035_Woman040_0591,whenever sixty years yeah yeah so I feel
Man035_Woman040_0592,like I mean I just like seeing you okay
Man035_Woman040_0593,like I like seeing you well and happy
Man035_Woman040_0594,and confident I think that's what scares
Man035_Woman040_0595,me also is that like I know everyone
Man035_Woman040_0596,dies at some point like that's the way
Man035_Woman040_0597,life goes
Man035_Woman040_0598,but I'm always I think what I'm scared
Man035_Woman040_0599,of the most is that you're gonna pass at
Man035_Woman040_0600,some point because of a reason you could
Man035_Woman040_0601,have you could have like controlled like
Man035_Woman040_0602,you could have like just I mean but the
Man035_Woman040_0603,whole heart attack scared like if you
Man035_Woman040_0604,were to pet like pass away because of
Man035_Woman040_0605,like your weight like that's what scares
Man035_Woman040_0606,me something that you just didn't like
Man035_Woman040_0607,you didn't care enough about yourself to
Man035_Woman040_0608,like make sure you were okay so oh both
Man035_Woman040_0609,we're both supposed to answer but both
