Man050_Woman055_0001,I've enjoy listen to you talk I'm doing
Man050_Woman055_0002,listen to your thoughts because I learn
Man050_Woman055_0003,a lot from you even at this age and
Man050_Woman055_0004,stage in my game you know yeah I like
Man050_Woman055_0005,the fact that we have a partnership it's
Man050_Woman055_0006,not a dependency right it's not you know
Man050_Woman055_0007,it seems healthy compared especially
Man050_Woman055_0008,with past relationships right and I when
Man050_Woman055_0009,I'm when I'm feeling a little
Man050_Woman055_0010,off-balance with whatever the life is
Man050_Woman055_0011,throwing at me I know I can come to you
Man050_Woman055_0012,and tell you I got your back okay yeah
Man050_Woman055_0013,okay whose turn is it not true my turn
Man050_Woman055_0014,again okay
Man050_Woman055_0015,what are you hesitant to tell me no it
Man050_Woman055_0016,doesn't there might be some times where
Man050_Woman055_0017,I think maybe twice about talking to
Man050_Woman055_0018,something a subject but then I always
Man050_Woman055_0019,end up talking to you about it because I
Man050_Woman055_0020,know that I'm gonna get a solution if I
Man050_Woman055_0021,do yeah
Man050_Woman055_0022,so I don't think I've ever really
Man050_Woman055_0023,hesitant to a point where I'll keep it
Man050_Woman055_0024,in for two or three days and not talk to
Man050_Woman055_0025,you about it okay your turn
Man050_Woman055_0026,yeah what is the sexual fantasy you're
Man050_Woman055_0027,afraid to ask me oh I don't have any
Man050_Woman055_0028,sexual fantasies with you I mean it's
Man050_Woman055_0029,just you and me I was afraid of that I
Man050_Woman055_0030,mean I like our sex life you know it
Man050_Woman055_0031,might be far if you between but when we
Man050_Woman055_0032,have sex it's good I mean I don't think
Man050_Woman055_0033,about having other partners or a
Man050_Woman055_0034,threesome or anything like that no way
Man050_Woman055_0035,no been there done that got the t-shirt

Man050_Woman055_0046,soundtrack now when my turn okay if you
Man050_Woman055_0047,can change one thing about me what would
Man050_Woman055_0048,it be
Man050_Woman055_0049,I have a suggestion I think that's a
Man050_Woman055_0050,good question change anything about you
Man050_Woman055_0051,I know you get the reason why I don't
Man050_Woman055_0052,want you to get your motor get a
Man050_Woman055_0053,motorcycle even though you've done the
Man050_Woman055_0054,course is because you know you had that
Man050_Woman055_0055,episode on the bicycle where he crashed
Man050_Woman055_0056,four times so your sense of balance yeah
Man050_Woman055_0057,I was thinking more along the ways that
Man050_Woman055_0058,like I the things I like to always put
Man050_Woman055_0059,things in their place and I'm always
Man050_Woman055_0060,moving things around and it kind of gets
Man050_Woman055_0061,you a little bit no that's just part of
Man050_Woman055_0062,the game I wouldn't change that okay
Man050_Woman055_0063,it's irritating but I wouldn't change it
Man050_Woman055_0064,okay okay your turn
Man050_Woman055_0065,what is a mistake you see me make
Man050_Woman055_0066,repeatedly why do you think I keep
Man050_Woman055_0067,making it
Man050_Woman055_0068,I'll pass on that one putting my coffee
Man050_Woman055_0069,cup in the wrong location one wrong
Man050_Woman055_0070,location that's true yeah it's just
Man050_Woman055_0071,something you do that's why I take it I
Man050_Woman055_0072,put it in the same location it's
Man050_Woman055_0073,something that I'm not gonna be able to
Man050_Woman055_0074,change okay so that's it that's really
Man050_Woman055_0075,nice take that you see you can never
Man050_Woman055_0076,find your keys I could never find my
Man050_Woman055_0077,keys or my glasses place the coffee cup
Man050_Woman055_0078,goes in the same place but my keys in my
Man050_Woman055_0079,glasses never go in the same place all
Man050_Woman055_0080,right my turn
Man050_Woman055_0081,oops wait man I'm taking up to what's
Man050_Woman055_0082,the big rip what is I'm sorry excuse me
Man050_Woman055_0083,what's the biggest compromise you've
Man050_Woman055_0084,made that I haven't acknowledged
Man050_Woman055_0085,that's a good question to really think
Man050_Woman055_0086,about that that you haven't acknowledged
Man050_Woman055_0087,no I think we communicate well I mean
Man050_Woman055_0088,the biggest compromise is your cat's you
Man050_Woman055_0089,know and I'd rather did not be in the
Man050_Woman055_0090,house but we've done pretty good on that
Man050_Woman055_0091,now they were in towers and outdoors now

Man050_Woman055_0094,by little they're now in my bed yes I

Man050_Woman055_0098,house and compromise you know that I

Man050_Woman055_0410,okay what's the pain in me you'd like to
Man050_Woman055_0411,you next question I guess we're going

Man050_Woman055_0413,more in this relationship
Man050_Woman055_0414,how would you measure that and that's
Man050_Woman055_0415,one of the things that we talked about
Man050_Woman055_0416,you know it's different the different
Man050_Woman055_0417,ways we show love you have a different
Man050_Woman055_0418,level of love than I do that I've always
Man050_Woman055_0419,told you press it differently you
Man050_Woman055_0420,express it differently than I do if I
Man050_Woman055_0421,had to answer straightforward that
Man050_Woman055_0422,question if that question was to me I
Man050_Woman055_0423,would say you love more in this
Man050_Woman055_0424,relationship doesn't mean that we that
Man050_Woman055_0425,we don't love each other you know to
Man050_Woman055_0426,death to his part it's just that you
Man050_Woman055_0427,your level of love or your concept of
Man050_Woman055_0428,love is a lot different than my concepts
Man050_Woman055_0429,of oh nothing wrong with that
Man050_Woman055_0430,there's nothing wrong with that I love
Man050_Woman055_0431,you no matter what yeah just you know
Man050_Woman055_0432,the things that I do to try to express
Man050_Woman055_0433,it yeah
Man050_Woman055_0434,I think I just do more free yeah you do
Man050_Woman055_0435,more people no part of that it has to do
Man050_Woman055_0436,with you know our schedule I work two
Man050_Woman055_0437,days a week you work five days a week so
Man050_Woman055_0438,I have more time to do it all right all
Man050_Woman055_0439,right and you express your love by you
Man050_Woman055_0440,know cooking me nice dinners and then
Man050_Woman055_0441,cleaning up and surprising me and stuff
Man050_Woman055_0442,where I don't really get the opportunity
Man050_Woman055_0443,to reciprocate I sort of feel bad about
Man050_Woman055_0444,that well we'll work on that I'm not
Man050_Woman055_0445,buying that you don't know how to make
Man050_Woman055_0446,chicken hmm what would you do if I
Man050_Woman055_0447,cheated on you oh yeah
Man050_Woman055_0448,I don't think I could do that what would
Man050_Woman055_0449,I do what would you do if I cheated on
Man050_Woman055_0450,you I would probably tell you not to be
Man050_Woman055_0451,around I don't think I can live with you
Man050_Woman055_0452,knowing that you cheated on me because I
Man050_Woman055_0453,would never trust you again yeah that
Man050_Woman055_0454,was a I think that's one of the things
Man050_Woman055_0455,that we've discussed yeah if you have a
Man050_Woman055_0456,need it can't be filled in the
Man050_Woman055_0457,relationship and need to step out just
Man050_Woman055_0458,tell me yeah as long as I know what the
Man050_Woman055_0459,rules are the relationship I'm willing
Man050_Woman055_0460,to play right I would never would want
Man050_Woman055_0461,it to come to that mm-hmm I think that's
Man050_Woman055_0462,the other thing that aging has to do
Man050_Woman055_0463,with us we don't have you know that
Man050_Woman055_0464,we've been there done that got the
Man050_Woman055_0465,t-shirt exactly we know what's you know
Man050_Woman055_0466,it hurts risk it hurts it's not worth
Man050_Woman055_0467,the risk
Man050_Woman055_0468,right the payoff is not worth the risk
Man050_Woman055_0469,right so love is definitely more
Man050_Woman055_0470,meaningful and gratifying than sex and
Man050_Woman055_0471,that's what both of us understand so
Man050_Woman055_0472,that's it I think that's a very good
Man050_Woman055_0473,that's a very good question well I think
Man050_Woman055_0474,that we handled like oh oh you're trying
Man050_Woman055_0475,it's my turn what's the hardest thing
Man050_Woman055_0476,about our relationship those are just
Man050_Woman055_0477,the hardest thing about our relationship
Man050_Woman055_0478,is our differences and that's you know I
Man050_Woman055_0479,was talking to somebody at work about
Man050_Woman055_0480,that anytime two people come together
Man050_Woman055_0481,their thought processes their history
Man050_Woman055_0482,their experience is the way they do
Man050_Woman055_0483,things are different you know you look
Man050_Woman055_0484,at things like when I place the coffee
Man050_Woman055_0485,cup on the counter in front of the
Man050_Woman055_0486,refrigerator after I could get a drink
Man050_Woman055_0487,of water and is it not being in the
Man050_Woman055_0488,right place and you said it by the
Man050_Woman055_0489,coffeepot and I can't understand how
Man050_Woman055_0490,every day you say where's my keys to the
Man050_Woman055_0491,point I said we're gonna get a t-shirt
Man050_Woman055_0492,made up that says where's my keys but
Man050_Woman055_0493,you know so those little kinds of
Man050_Woman055_0494,differences they're not really that hard
Man050_Woman055_0495,to do it's not the elephants that some
Man050_Woman055_0496,mosquitoes yeah I don't say man
Man050_Woman055_0497,those are the little things you know the
Man050_Woman055_0498,way we both said in our own the way I
Man050_Woman055_0499,Drive is different than the way you
Man050_Woman055_0500,drive right I tell you directions and
Man050_Woman055_0501,you tell me other things and those are
Man050_Woman055_0502,not really when you think that this is
Man050_Woman055_0503,silly little things they're heart and
Man050_Woman055_0504,they're too hard yeah no it's the
Man050_Woman055_0505,differences is I'd rather you know I'd
Man050_Woman055_0506,rather be learning a new song on the
Man050_Woman055_0507,guitar or learning to play the bass yeah
Man050_Woman055_0508,because I tend to watch mindless TV and
Man050_Woman055_0509,watch TV they get that would relax me
Man050_Woman055_0510,mindless TV relaxed me yeah after a long
Man050_Woman055_0511,hard day of work I would like I'd like
Man050_Woman055_0512,you to get more involved with the music
Man050_Woman055_0513,with me well I do one I have them
Man050_Woman055_0514,interested in playing the what is it
Man050_Woman055_0515,Congress the Congress okay I think it's
Man050_Woman055_0516,something that I could probably would
Man050_Woman055_0517,get had a lot of fun out of I think my
Man050_Woman055_0518,personality would work with that yeah
Man050_Woman055_0519,that's that's the one I guess I'd be the
Man050_Woman055_0520,one thing in our relationship I'd change
Man050_Woman055_0521,to going back to a previous question
Man050_Woman055_0522,because I mean I enjoy reading some
Man050_Woman055_0523,books with you and we'd go into some of
Man050_Woman055_0524,the same movies but a lot of times the
Man050_Woman055_0525,just the TV shows that you'd like to
Man050_Woman055_0526,walk watch on a regular basis I'm not
Man050_Woman055_0527,dinner in terrestrial okay how do you

Man050_Woman055_0556,that you're so genuinely nice to
Man050_Woman055_0557,everybody
Man050_Woman055_0558,to the point to sometimes it concerns me
Man050_Woman055_0559,okay my mother was like that Mommy was
Man050_Woman055_0560,like that you know when you're engaging
Man050_Woman055_0561,with homeless people and giving them you

Man050_Woman055_0566,experiences I've seen a lot more of
Man050_Woman055_0567,kind of the bad stuff in this world and
Man050_Woman055_0568,I and I understand you know you got to
Man050_Woman055_0569,kind of keep your eyes open and be
Man050_Woman055_0570,responsible if your own safety and you

Man050_Woman055_0574,benefit of the doubt yeah whatever yeah

Man050_Woman055_0577,good me okay alrighty then
Man050_Woman055_0578,oh this is a good one do you think you
Man050_Woman055_0579,do you think you're meant to be together
Man050_Woman055_0580,and why there's no question absolutely
Man050_Woman055_0581,absolutely I mean that's I mean it's
Man050_Woman055_0582,it's unfortunate you know I think about
Man050_Woman055_0583,what wouldn't have happened if we had
Man050_Woman055_0584,met each other when we were younger but
Man050_Woman055_0585,then I think no it would have never
Man050_Woman055_0586,worked it would have never worked we
Man050_Woman055_0587,were meant to be together now he knows
Man050_Woman055_0588,you know that's one of the things that
Man050_Woman055_0589,we talked about when we first got to
Man050_Woman055_0590,know each other and you know and some of
Man050_Woman055_0591,our mutual friends knew about me before
Man050_Woman055_0592,you knew about me was that you know with
Man050_Woman055_0593,relationship history and the past
Man050_Woman055_0594,divorce and just the dissatisfaction
Man050_Woman055_0595,with the dating and you know very casual
Man050_Woman055_0596,relationships that I just decided you
Man050_Woman055_0597,know that I wasn't gonna do that anymore
Man050_Woman055_0598,and that if I was going to be intimately
Man050_Woman055_0599,involved with somebody would be somebody
Man050_Woman055_0600,that was my wife right right and I made
Man050_Woman055_0601,that decision eight years before meeting
Man050_Woman055_0602,you right and and you know it got to the
Man050_Woman055_0603,point where okay if it doesn't happen it
Man050_Woman055_0604,doesn't happen the day I saw you I knew
Man050_Woman055_0605,and that's I love that story
Man050_Woman055_0606,I love that story when you tell it yeah
Man050_Woman055_0607,I do it was overwhelming and feeling and
Man050_Woman055_0608,it was almost it caught me off guard it
Man050_Woman055_0609,was almost you know like like had
Man050_Woman055_0610,experience as a teenager or something
Man050_Woman055_0611,which has been a long time ago and you
Man050_Woman055_0612,know I I had a lot of mutual friends
Man050_Woman055_0613,there were very attractive women that
Man050_Woman055_0614,you know and we felt like that towards
Man050_Woman055_0615,anybody in the day I saw you I knew that
Man050_Woman055_0616,I knew there was something there and it
Man050_Woman055_0617,baffled me like that blindside about yet
Man050_Woman055_0618,so there's definitely I believe
Man050_Woman055_0619,something very powerful put us together
Man050_Woman055_0620,put those together absolutely
Man050_Woman055_0621,and is there a second is there an it's y
Man050_Woman055_0622,know there's the s we answered the Y I
Man050_Woman055_0623,think I had to I think it was just our
Man050_Woman055_0624,time to be together in our lives to have
Man050_Woman055_0625,a relationship like this in our later
Man050_Woman055_0626,lives after we've experienced all that
Man050_Woman055_0627,stuff you could be right about this you
Man050_Woman055_0628,know yeah that's yours
Man050_Woman055_0629,that's yours what lessons have you
Man050_Woman055_0630,learned from previous relationships
Man050_Woman055_0631,you're using none I am not using any of
Man050_Woman055_0632,my past relationships with our
Man050_Woman055_0633,relationship I rather not go there what
Man050_Woman055_0634,lessons have you learned from previous
Man050_Woman055_0635,relationships that you're you are using
Man050_Woman055_0636,in ours I would have to I think the
Man050_Woman055_0637,number one lesson I've learned from
Man050_Woman055_0638,previous relationships is to completely
Man050_Woman055_0639,let go you know whether you know I took
Man050_Woman055_0640,a chance when you know we were friends
Man050_Woman055_0641,and I told you you know
Man050_Woman055_0642,wasn't i wasn't going for like just a
