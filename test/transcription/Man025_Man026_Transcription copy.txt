Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0073,I mean I don't think we're making work I
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0074,think it works because we love each
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0075,other
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0076,mm-hmm I don't it was like a question
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0077,about like why would make it work now
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0078,knowing that like we're gonna miss each
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0079,other at the high school mm-hmm I would
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0080,say it's just because like I'm really
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0081,happy right now and like just because I
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0082,know that like that happiness might end
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0083,at the end of like August or whatever
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0084,like I still want to be happy and I'm
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0085,happy

Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0089,questions about like leaving and like
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0090,ending and I don't know I don't there's
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0091,nothing I like want from you you're like
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0092,you're just you're you and like
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0093,everything that our relationship is like
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0094,right now I don't know I don't know the
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0095,answer to that question
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0096,can skip this one
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0097,to answer that question the best I could
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0098,I would say do you think we'll ever get
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0099,back together at some point in the
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0100,future
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0101,do you know what I thought you're
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0102,supposed to be answering it I'm not sure
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0103,this is different from saying do I want
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0104,us to get back together in the future
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0105,knowing that we're gonna go our separate
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0106,ways most likely from college I would I
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0107,would love that but do I think it'll
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0108,happen who knows it depends like they're
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0109,going you know whatever you know if
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0110,that's Massachusetts or like Delaware
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0111,Minnesota and I'm most likely gonna be
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0112,like here in the city I'm sure we'll see
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0113,each other again but like we get back
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0114,together I'm not sure but I would love
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0115,if that happen
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0116,still my time because that was my
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0117,question
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0118,what do you think you missed out on what
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0119,do you think you missed out on a while
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0120,being in this relationship if I had to
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0121,say like something maybe it would it
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0122,would be like me being more socially
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0123,independent you know what I mean cuz
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0124,like I have my own friends but I usually
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0125,like I feel like I cycle out friends
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0126,based on like a relationship I'm in and
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0127,like my significant others friends and
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0128,so I don't like that's not really
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0129,specific to this relationship it's more
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0130,just like what if I missed out on by
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0131,being in relationships is like a chance
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0132,to be socially independent like for
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0133,myself
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0134,why don't you need me anymore I don't
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0135,answer that question me that again
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0136,why don't you need me anymore I don't
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0137,think it's like a matter of like I mean
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0138,do you need okay

Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0142,become in college board I can come boy
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0143,because I like I want you to like do
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0144,things that you want to do and like
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0145,regardless of what other people think
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0146,you should be doing and so I don't want
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0147,you to feel like you're caught in
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0148,something that you had no intention of
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0149,being in and just sort of being stuck
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0150,what's one thing you don't want to
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0151,forget about me
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0152,no you don't want me to forget about you
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0153,what's one thing you don't want me to
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0154,forget about you and I think you're
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0155,special
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0156,I think you
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0157,that's not about you about me yeah
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0158,something about you thought I was like I
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0159,want you to forget that I was cool what
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0160,happens Tyler's me meant to you I don't
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0161,know I mean like it's been really good
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0162,and it's been really challenging and
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0163,it's been really different I think it's
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0164,just meant like a sort of like closing
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0165,of my child out of it I mean I feel like
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0166,my childhood and like a really a long
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0167,time ago but if I had to like say that
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0168,it like meant something and like the
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0169,context of my entire life that's
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0170,probably some meaning I would assign to
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0171,it but I don't I don't know yeah
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0172,how do you feel about me being with
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0173,someone else we had like a problem with
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0174,Jake before like and I've learned from
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0175,that but like now I think I was like at
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0176,that time I think I was immature in a
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0177,way and I didn't like understand but
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0178,being with you longer it's like made me
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0179,realize that like it's great just to
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0180,know you and like I'm okay with knowing
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0181,that like when you find somebody else
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0182,like that she'll be happy and like that
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0183,okay what are you going to take away
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0184,from this relationship um communication
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0185,is really important like really really
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0186,really really really really important
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0187,more important than you think and that

Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0189,outside of my control
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0190,that I feel like I'm more used to being
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0191,in my control and that sometimes I'll be
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0192,in situations where I don't like have as
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0193,much control as I would like but I have
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0194,to manage it anyways like man it's my
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0195,lack of control yeah that's what I'm
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0196,taking away okay
Man025_Man026_Transcription copy_0197,crowd questions I'm like mad at you guys
