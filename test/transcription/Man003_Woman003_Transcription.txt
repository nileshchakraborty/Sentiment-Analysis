Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0058,have some savings though okay I have
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0059,some savings okay that's pretty good all
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0060,right okay but it still would feel that
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0061,on the most I'm the breadwinner yes but
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0062,if I have some savings oh okay you go
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0063,they my turn to pick up the gun yes what

Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0065,anything are you is there anything
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0066,you're scared to tell me oh I guess
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0067,about my my past when I was at what my
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0068,drug use
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0069,all right but not too scared they told
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0070,okay because in my case there's really
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0071,nothing about to be afraid to tell you
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0072,because you told me everything I told
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0073,you everything it was pretty easy yeah
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0074,okay so that's about or you think about
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0075,no okay did you ever want children with
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0076,me no absolutely not
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0077,it would be a beautiful blue-eyed girl
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0078,yeah well the thing is you have to have
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0079,a better maturity level so what can I
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0080,tell you some people are destined not to
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0081,have children except we have a
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0082,stepdaughter from hell
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0083,okay well stepdaughter from hell is
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0084,better than no do it up mm-hmm
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0085,okay what's the biggest compromise that
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0086,you have made that I have not
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0087,acknowledged oh yes I guess not having
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0088,to the children and also not having a
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0089,bigger place to keep all my oh my god
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0090,you just need a whole warehouse this
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0091,place be big enough for you a walk-in
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0092,closet okay like 20 of them yeah all
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0093,right
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0094,that's really nothing my turn I think
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0095,it's you yes who has more power in the
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0096,relationship you or me that depends on
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0097,the activity level when it comes to
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0098,financial things obviously I probably
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0099,have some more power when it comes to
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0100,social things you probably have more
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0101,power the main reason is because you
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0102,whine better than me
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0103,thank ya that's not a compliment it's
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0104,like a badass compliment well yeah

Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0138,yeah both of them in my way they could
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0139,play the bathroom yeah but that's not
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0140,real insecurity okay you know I I don't
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0141,see true insecurity I really am true yes
Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0142,you have them folks are you really in

Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0157,properties about them some qualities and

Man003_Woman003_Transcription_0161,of a like a total package all right so I
