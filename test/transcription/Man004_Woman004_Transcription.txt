Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0009,memory and why probably to like more
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0010,generally speaking just being together

Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0013,and us that you should be adventurous
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0014,and like piling into mom's minivan and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0015,driving to Florida and going out to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0016,California when Laura came in and just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0017,like feeling really safe and free
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0018,I feel like generally like any time with
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0019,family it's just like a good memory for
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0020,me because it was important to you guys
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0021,and like it shaped me but I would say my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0022,first memory that is that I can like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0023,remember having as a little kid
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0024,and I'm only saying this because it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0025,involves you is I remember being really
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0026,sick one night like super sick and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0027,having a fever I don't know how old I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0028,was but you like took me out of bed and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0029,held me in your room like buying a big
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0030,dresser that you have and like just kept
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0031,rocking me back and forth and like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0032,petting my head and I like I remember
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0033,that like I remember feeling really safe
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0034,it's my first memory and like probably
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0035,my it's like safe place memory well that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0036,that's that's a good memory to have I'm
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0037,not sure I wouldn't think you could go
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0038,back quite that far but and I'm not sure
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0039,how far it is but that process that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0040,described happens from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0041,when you were not necessarily you didn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0042,have to be sick for me to hold you close
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0043,that way yeah and I just just love you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0044,but I remember like being really sick
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0045,and you're doing it I'm sure it happened
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0046,more times than that oh that's that's a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0047,that's a certainly a pleasant memory for
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0048,me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0049,I miss it hard to hold me now all right
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0050,right away if we get to the next
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0051,question all of the adventures were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0052,we're not that easy for both of us she
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0053,doesn't talk about it but there were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0054,occasions we went astray a little bit
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0055,and nothing serious the family
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0056,adventures who are fun indeed I'm sorry
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0057,when you when you think of the first
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0058,time we met what do you remember I guess
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0059,when you think of when I was born what's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0060,here fuck yeah yes I still see you as an
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0061,infant as soon as you were born I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0062,there as as you know I have seven
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0063,children but before you my oldest four I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0064,never saw being born
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0065,it just wasn't permitted then and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0066,starting with Nick and then you and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0067,Julie I did was in the room where the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0068,birth took place so clearly that blessed
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0069,that first time I met you and some
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0070,babies but you know newborn babies it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0071,not their finest moment but you were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0072,beautiful from the day that you were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0073,born and I still could see your face
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0074,I've forgotten a lot of other things but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0075,I still seated your face the day that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0076,you were born it was it was a wonderful
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0077,occasion every child's birth is a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0078,wonderful occasion
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0079,you were youth wishing your mom's first
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0080,child and that was special to her and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0081,certainly was special to me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0082,and hasn't changed you are still and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0083,always will be special okay I don't have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0084,anything to say about the first time we
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0085,went no mic yeah we just go back and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0086,forth okay is sort of like the other one
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0087,but it's what's the most fun you've had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0088,with me and why we went to Cedar Point
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0089,in Ohio with John Andrew and because you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0090,were like a little kid I mean you were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0091,like running around here on every roller
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0092,coaster you were like you were just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0093,really happy and like just such a free
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0094,spirit and it was just a fun trip but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0095,that's like that's my probably I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0096,certainly remember that likewise it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0097,a fun experience besides you and Julie
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0098,your brother Nick was there your brother
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0099,John was there and then several of your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0100,nieces and nephews and I just read you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0101,say I was energetic and participating in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0102,everything but what I also remember from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0103,that trip I'm not sure I could do it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0104,anymore but in those days I was able to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0105,trick the like 50-something well like 20
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0106,years off or something like that oh they
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0107,were 20 years old yeah I remember
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0108,yeah whatever age I actually was we
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0109,could sort of figure it out it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0110,probably about maybe 15 years ago
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0111,no no quick 10 well anyway anyway they I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0112,remember what age they guessed that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0113,guessed 48 which may not seem like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0114,that's doing anybody any favors but I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0115,was told
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0116,years beyond that 58 so yeah that's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0117,about what it was yeah so it was a fun
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0118,fun time yes I remember it well is your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0119,turn all right I'm gonna just never know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0120,if you're getting this but please edit
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0121,that out okay okay what do you think is
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0122,special about our relationship
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0123,I think the one word that would describe
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0124,but the most is respect we have plenty
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0125,of differences differences in just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0126,opinions not that many of those and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0127,sometimes differences or you know other
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0128,things certainly doing the planning of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0129,your wedding we've had a few but mostly
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0130,I have like whatever you want to do you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0131,know it stands almost exclusive had I've
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0132,done that and you're gonna have a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0133,wonderful wedding but I of course I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0134,respect you but I I believe in you okay
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0135,and with your six siblings blessed would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0136,every one of them and said for them if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0137,not all of them in their own way have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0138,excelled you from the day that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0139,started interacting with other people
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0140,on children and adults which would have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0141,been it wasn't the first time if that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0142,happened but when you were at the child
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0143,care center the one that was associated
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0144,with the church and she spent a lot of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0145,time in there's a very well-run center
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0146,but from that time till as recently as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0147,when Anna when you visited with with
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0148,Anna and she her you know sent back
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0149,accolades commendations anytime anyone
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0150,interacts with you even for just a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0151,little teeny bit they always come away
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0152,not just with her she's nice or
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0153,something like that but they come away
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0154,if it gets back to familiar to your mom
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0155,and oftentimes it does with superlatives
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0156,so you have always engendered that kind
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0157,of reaction in people it's something I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0158,admire about you you have always
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0159,excelled
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0160,going back to the days mrs. niches class
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0161,where you were doing the presentations
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0162,and we would go over them together but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0163,you never had a second problem in any of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0164,your schoolwork or academics and through
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0165,college if there was any problem and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0166,perhaps still now it's that you are so
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0167,concerned with perfection that sometimes
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0168,oftentimes it becomes stressful for you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0169,but you have done nothing for your 30
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0170,years but distinguish yourself and I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0171,have no doubt that whatever you do
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0172,whatever you attempt to do your getting
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0173,involved in the business now I have no
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0174,doubt that you will be successful and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0175,always be as poised and personable and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0176,nice as you are now do that in its
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0177,entirety like you're giving wedding
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0178,speeches okay talking to me nothing I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0179,know I know they could always get it in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0180,there I agree about but the respects all
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0181,right I feel like you think that I call
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0182,mom more than I call you but I I call
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0183,you just as much and I call you when I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0184,like really need it like when I need
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0185,advice because I trust your opinion and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0186,I value it and sometimes I call mom just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0187,to kind of like I'm walking from one
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0188,spot to another so you know just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0189,shooting a shit and I do that with you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0190,too but it's differently when I call you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0191,get really excited and then you like you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0192,know if I have a problem or anything I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0193,know that you're not treating me like a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0194,little kid anymore like you're coming at
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0195,it from an adult perspective and you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0196,treat me like an equal usually
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0197,and mom comes at it in a different way
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0198,both are good but I just I value that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0199,relationship that it's more of a respect
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0200,rather than mom still sometimes sees me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0201,as like a little kid or or like her
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0202,friend and I don't think that were I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0203,don't know that we're we're friends but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0204,in a different way it's almost like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0205,we're equals and you just you have a lot
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0206,more respect I think and you show it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0207,differently than mom does if that makes
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0208,sense
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0209,well thank you for that I have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0210,absolutely no jealousy when there's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0211,interaction between you and Julie and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0212,your mom or even some of your other
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0213,siblings first of all she what raised
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0214,you single-handedly my job had me out of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0215,town all the time it's not that I wasn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0216,a good father I think I was but I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0217,away a lot and one of the things that's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0218,most pleasing to me now is the really
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0219,excellent relationship that you and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0220,Julie have with your mom and sure we
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0221,talk when it's necessary we talk just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0222,when we feel like talking and I know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0223,you're in touch with your mom every you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0224,know all the time and that's exactly as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0225,it should be so I would hope that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0226,keep that up when you don't call
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0227,sometimes you're away or something
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0228,I mean I'll shrug my shoulders but she
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0229,misses it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0230,what was the hardest thing for you about
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0231,being a father
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0232,well I had a lot of hardships as a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0233,father not so much with you with Julie
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0234,but with your older siblings and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0235,certainly going back to your four oldest
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0236,siblings who had the same mother and and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0237,that was a terrible terrible
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0238,relationship that I had with her and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0239,coming from a broken home myself and my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0240,kids saying retrospectively it was a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0241,mistake but long after that marriage was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0242,completely gone I stayed because I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0243,thought that was best for your four
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0244,older siblings I don't have any regrets
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0245,about that okay I don't avoid people who
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0246,aren't getting along should not be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0247,together but they need to also make take
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0248,serious consideration of children if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0249,they have them so parenting your four
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0250,older siblings under those circumstances
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0251,were as you can imagine extremely
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0252,difficult I tried to be a good father
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0253,and I think I was I think if if you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0254,would talk to your older siblings which
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0255,I know you do they don't they don't hold
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0256,anything against me so it's not so much
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0257,that but the question was what was you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0258,know most difficult and it would have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0259,been those times I didn't have really
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0260,very much difficulty with you and Julie
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0261,Julie was did her academics on her own
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0262,terms but certainly neither one of you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0263,from that from the day you were born
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0264,caused either your mother or me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0265,any any aggravation or anything no it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0266,true it's really true doesn't mean that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0267,you always did exactly what you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0268,totally right but lucky saying thank the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0269,older kids broke you in mm yeah no I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0270,knew then and I know now and I know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0271,retrospectively what a all children are
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0272,good unless they are made to be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0273,otherwise but some whether it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0274,hereditary your upbringing or
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0275,environment or what have you or less
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0276,troublesome let's just saying in others
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0277,in our new engineer you just learn I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0278,mean there weren't any problems yeah and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0279,I can't say that but it what have you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0280,all do she thinks it knit yes but the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0281,other four they're all they're all fine
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0282,now so that's that's that's the good
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0283,news it's my turn yeah I'm taking from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0284,here right yep
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0285,all right what's the most ridiculous
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0286,thing I've done what did it teach you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0287,about me so you're gonna tell me if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0288,that's our choice I think we used to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0289,have family barbecues and you would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0290,break those bricks at their head it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0291,just the most ridiculous but I think at
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0292,the time I remember being horribly
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0293,embarrassed and I'm scared for you but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0294,now looking back I appreciate it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0295,because you just didn't care you just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0296,you had this like thing that you needed
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0297,to prove that you at least looking back
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0298,I take it that you were strong enough to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0299,still do this and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0300,you were you could and it was a pretty
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0301,cool parlor check anyway
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0302,but I appreciate that about you because
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0303,you've done it you did it when when you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0304,found out that you were sick and you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0305,still went to China and you went up the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0306,Great Wall and you had to climb it and I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0307,remember fighting with you about it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0308,before when we were in Zion National
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0309,Park and being so angry with you but I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0310,guess don't like stems from the same
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0311,thing that you like need to show people
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0312,that you can do it and I have that in me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0313,so I guess like me that's part of the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0314,reason that it pisses me off and you do
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0315,it but when I like look back at it I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0316,appreciate that like in those moments
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0317,you don't that like you're just you need
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0318,to prove it to yourself in to everyone
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0319,else and you don't just kind of sit
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0320,still and say like the doctor told me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0321,that this isn't gonna happen so it just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0322,won't still think it wasn't the best
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0323,idea but I kind of appreciate that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0324,think you're a cowboy sometimes well
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0325,more often than not if I did that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0326,whatever the setting it was because
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0327,somebody asked me to do it okay it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0328,wasn't the little kids that the food
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0329,asked we was doing with me no but it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0330,the adults and I didn't know I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0331,embarrassing anybody but you know I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0332,would also admit that every now and then
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0333,whatever the occasion it wasn't just at
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0334,our barbecues like if I felt that this
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0335,was that I wanted to show off I would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0336,want to chase me to break a brick or
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0337,something like that so I would be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0338,responding to somebody who is looking
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0339,back now the fact that you're like 60
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0340,something-year-old father could smash a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0341,brick with his head is what kind of a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0342,kind of cool like I can say that I think
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0343,I probably could still do it I was it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0344,hard to find a brick around the house
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0345,that he wore your mom hides him but yeah
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0346,I mean if somebody asked me now I would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0347,still do it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0348,and when the time comes that I can't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0349,anymore which is probably not that far
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0350,often so--but please know brick-breaking
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0351,I have to blow my nose get you'll be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0352,able to edit that I'm sorry about that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0353,it is allergy something triggering my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0354,own okay okay what's the greatest lesson
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0355,I taught you and that's it that's a good
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0356,question the egg teaching the chicken or
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0357,the grasshopper teaching the what I've
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0358,learned from you is patience and poise
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0359,and at times I have that and sometimes
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0360,if I'm angry I may disguise it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0361,deliberately or not not have it you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0362,don't lose your you you do get stressed
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0363,and I mentioned that earlier because you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0364,expect so much of yourself and you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0365,expect such a level of organization that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0366,when it's not happening you can become
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0367,stressed but you're always poised you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0368,always in control of yourself
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0369,you're always respectful of others now I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0370,wouldn't say that you've taught me that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0371,that's something I tried to instill in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0372,all my children but then seeing that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0373,reflected in you it makes me very very
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0374,proud so in my mind you're all but a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0375,human a perfect human being in my mind
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0376,to a large degree I think that that's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0377,more than in my mind but that's still in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0378,the ibises of the b-and-b o beholder and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0379,clearly there's some prejudice on my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0380,part but you know you are for anybody
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0381,and myself included
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0382,I'm going to use a word that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0383,probably expected to be used anyway you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0384,are the quintessential example of a just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0385,a really good decent person
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0386,what are you hesitant to tell me now
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0387,that's a good one
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0388,I don't think there's anything I like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0389,I'm pretty open and honest with you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0390,anything that I haven't already told you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0391,I think going into the wedding I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0392,hesitant to tell you how strongly I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0393,didn't want to do it but I think at this
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0394,point that's already come and I think
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0395,I'm past that part and I'm excited I'm
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0396,happy for it but generally speaking I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0397,feel like you know I don't certainly
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0398,feel that you withhold much from me so
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0399,that that comports with you know what I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0400,perceive how am I most like you and how
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0401,does that scare you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0402,oh well you have a lot of your mom in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0403,you but you certainly have plenty of me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0404,I think maybe the thing that I'd be most
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0405,concerned of a characteristic which I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0406,know that we share is sensitivity yeah
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0407,and that's why sometimes when we are
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0408,talking we'll say something you to me or
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0409,I to you and it will disturb or hurt
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0410,even the other person the other party
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0411,and we probably you know oftentimes what
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0412,happens is we'll say something you could
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0413,text something and then realize you know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0414,this was hurtful when I want to send
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0415,back and either explain it or apologize
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0416,but should either one of us be as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0417,sensitive as we are I don't think either
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0418,one of us could be anything else but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0419,that is I don't know that I've past
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0420,doing any traits to you not if you've
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0421,had all of them you'd have putti
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0422,negative traits but I don't perceive
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0423,that I've passed on any traits to you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0424,that are
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0425,you know really negative or detrimental
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0426,to your your living your life that one
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0427,though I think is is an obvious to me I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0428,think I have another one and it's only
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0429,with you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0430,good stubbornness like anime beauty
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0431,comes from the sensitivity thing but you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0432,like sometimes approach things as if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0433,you're still negotiating like you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0434,still debating everything and it's a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0435,battle and I get to a point where I just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0436,I I want you to see my side of it and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0437,you won't back down and oh it's so
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0438,stubborn and that's from you cuz mom
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0439,doesn't have it mom will just kind of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0440,feel like okay you think by generally
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0441,speaking I only do it with you well I'm
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0442,certainly I don't wouldn't call it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0443,argumentative but if I'm if I feel that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0444,I'm because argumentative just implies
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0445,you just you know you're all I could
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0446,about everything like that it's more
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0447,like as if you're I mean I never saw you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0448,in action at work but I can imagine I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0449,mean your job was to basically to meet
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0450,with people and have them see your side
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0451,and sometimes you translate that into
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0452,your day-to-day life and you certainly
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0453,do that with your family because I think
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0454,we're a bit more forgiving and then
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0455,everyone else seems to just be like okay
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0456,dad that's fine yeah I engaged felonies
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0457,probably shouldn't I don't know that it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0458,relates to anything so much that I did
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0459,at work from when I was growing up I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0460,if I had an opinion I was pretty pretty
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0461,much willing to stand by it go back a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0462,far enough and then I grew up in a rough
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0463,neighborhood sometimes that would be did
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0464,the supporting my opinion might involved
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0465,you know a little physical interaction
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0466,but not more often and even as I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0467,going through school when I had an
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0468,opinion I would pretty much try to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0469,defend it but others may not see me that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0470,way and you may not but I see myself as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0471,first of all
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0472,almost completely logical so that some
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0473,things have nothing to do with logic
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0474,just what you think but if somebody
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0475,proves me wrong I do back wolf now like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0476,I do recall I don't know if it was you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0477,or Julie I did one of one of you your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0478,brothers and sisters and it might have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0479,been several of you would say to me we
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0480,would get into a discussion because I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0481,would say to all of you if you want to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0482,do something or not do something you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0483,know make your case yeah your mom would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0484,just say no you can't do it sometimes
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0485,you know I would say no let's listen
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0486,right in those cases you're very
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0487,rational but every now and then in it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0488,not necessarily that setting but one of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0489,you would say to me well you're not
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0490,being feared dad quote you lose your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0491,using logic well I mean other than you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0492,that said it but if it happened a few
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0493,times over your mom never said that she
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0494,probably thinks it my turn yeah I like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0495,this game nut game I mean whatever it is
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0496,thank you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0497,when or what was the toughest
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0498,relationship that took toughest moment
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0499,in your relationship in air it is air
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0500,yes thank you I think when I was leaving
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0501,for South America
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0502,you were just so deceivingly so
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0503,disappointed and the fact that I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0504,like had been going on this trajectory
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0505,that was so by-the-book and I had this
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0506,relationship and I had a good job
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0507,and I didn't really console with you or
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0508,mom I just did it for the most part it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0509,was kind of like I'm booking this ticket
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0510,it was more of a courtesy call rather
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0511,than a discussion and I think I had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0512,never really done that before and I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0513,think I was probably scaring you a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0514,little bit that I did it um we didn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0515,talk very much when I went you know come
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0516,with me to the airport and like even the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0517,day before you were asking me if like I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0518,would stay and I was like I already
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0519,booked a ticket and you said I'll pay
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0520,for you to not go and part of it I think
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0521,was ingest but I think you were not
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0522,happy with the decision that I made and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0523,you didn't do a very good job of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0524,covering that up which is fine but I the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0525,feeling of disappointing you I think was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0526,the hardest part well I think you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0527,misinterpreted that it's not that I had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0528,I mean you had a good job at the time I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0529,had a good how you were fortunate enough
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0530,to have a good job right out of college
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0531,and you just gave that up
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0532,that was not my main concern because I I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0533,knew that you could get any job you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0534,worried I mean as far as like being
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0535,supportive you weren't and I never had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0536,you not be supportive you're usually
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0537,kind of like my biggest cheerleader and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0538,you weren't in that moment and you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0539,probably didn't realize it but it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0540,that was tough and I wasn't I didn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0541,want to have to convince you otherwise
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0542,because I understood where you were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0543,coming from but I remember you saying
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0544,you know asking whether Sebastian and I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0545,would say
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0546,together and I said I didn't know and if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0547,we didn't then we weren't meant to be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0548,together that this is something I had to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0549,do and you didn't like that response and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0550,you didn't like that he wasn't coming
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0551,and you were meant reminded me that beds
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0552,get cold when people are away I think of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0553,what you said well and it ended up being
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0554,true I mean we weren't a good fit but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0555,I'm gone I want had i not left i
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0556,wouldn't have realized that i wouldn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0557,be where I am now if I hadn't done it I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0558,who knows where I would have been I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0559,would have been happy well
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0560,retrospectively and I'm not sure I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0561,aware of all that you're saying now your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0562,feelings but what I remember the most
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0563,wasn't so much a concern about how you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0564,would you know get away with your career
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0565,I had complete faith in you with in that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0566,respect I was concerned about your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0567,well-being I was until the end and you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0568,came back and again it's this is not
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0569,retrospective this actually happened
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0570,yeah I did raise a question about
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0571,whether relationship of I think it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0572,five years by that point you know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0573,between two young people could survive
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0574,being away that wall so and and and as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0575,you say now maybe that would have broken
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0576,up anyway but that actually did come to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0577,pass 14 I currently needed to leave for
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0578,five months six months right now I have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0579,no doubt that I would my relationship
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0580,would be fine I was with the wrong
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0581,person
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0582,neither do I okay that's them but but in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0583,terms of Sebastian that's hindsight but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0584,the other thing that in fact I did
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0585,predict was I was concerned for your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0586,well-being in in two regards
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0587,unfortunately that came to pass you were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0588,pretty seriously mom it's a fortunately
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0589,weren't injured but when you were in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0590,Uruguay what do you require wouldn't it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0591,okay Ecuador
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0592,and and then the other thing is that a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0593,terrible terrible
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0594,I guess it was a fungus right yeah that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0595,you had which was a major problem could
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0596,have actually cost your life in fact of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0597,course I don't mean money-wise cost but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0598,the major sin valve major surgery now
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0599,nobody necessarily could have predicted
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0600,that so I'm not saying you know what we
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0601,could walk out in the street right now I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0602,got hit by a car
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0603,it was just like I've never felt more
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0604,sure about something in my life and when
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0605,I made that decision and you were so
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0606,against it and so obviously against it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0607,and you're like use no filter it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0608,just it was tough you know you I want
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0609,you to be proud of me and I want you to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0610,support things that I'm doing and that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0611,was a moment when you didn't and I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0612,understand I don't know how that would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0613,feel and I understand where you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0614,coming from with all of it but as your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0615,daughter as someone that had to like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0616,hear some of that feedback a lot of it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0617,being kind of cold was ah I'm very sorry
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0618,if that's either the way I was or the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0619,way you perceived it I was very proud of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0620,what you were doing and I would brag
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0621,about you all the time during that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0622,six-month period and before and after
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0623,you know how you were you weren't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0624,getting paid and you were really working
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0625,with negative native peoples and you you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0626,know you were working for nonprofits and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0627,you were you were not trying but you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0628,didn't work helping people so I was very
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0629,proud of what you were doing I was also
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0630,proud that a young woman of weird 25 had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0631,the was courageous enough to undertake a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0632,venture like that in adventure and we
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0633,cool exactly being as negative as you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0634,describe me but I'm not sounding that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0635,that's where you perceive me but if so I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0636,got over it very quickly I didn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0637,until you came back I didn't get over
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0638,you know being concerned for your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0639,well-being but beyond that and of course
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0640,the thing with Sebastian that was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0641,playing out as you were down there and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0642,that that pretty obviously at this point
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0643,was meant to be but I was very proud of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0644,you for what you did and I am I am now
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0645,I'm sorry if I didn't project that at
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0646,the proper time it's not to be Seavers
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0647,what did you learn from your parents
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0648,that you wish you could forget might be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0649,a more appropriate question if I said
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0650,what what do you want to remember about
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0651,your parents and your upbringing now I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0652,want to quickly qualify that my mother
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0653,who at a point in time was a single
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0654,mother of six at a time when women were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0655,not very often in the workplace and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0656,certainly not what six kids anyway and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0657,my father would he wasn't totally out of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0658,the picture but he he hardly supported
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0659,us and we didn't see him very often but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0660,I mean we we were the fact that we were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0661,as poor as we were I mean at least at a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0662,time
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0663,I am my five siblings you know got
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0664,closer and because of that my mother was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0665,a person that didn't have an evil bone
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0666,in her body not a mean bone
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0667,body my father let's finish what him was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0668,not much of a father so I did learn from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0669,him when I said earlier that I stayed
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0670,with a wife that really wasn't intended
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0671,that was more the course of going up
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0672,that way in that situation he abandoned
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0673,us so I wasn't going to do that to my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0674,you know my kids my mother was nothing
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0675,if she wasn't the kindest most decent
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0676,person in the world but she had habits
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0677,that would just drive people crazy in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0678,general and certainly drives me and my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0679,brothers and sisters crazy I think we've
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0680,talked about some of them so I'll just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0681,review one that to this day she had this
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0682,thing that if you drank water with your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0683,food any meal anytime snack it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0684,unhealthy you should not be done so that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0685,whatever food we have at any given time
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0686,we were permitted and then she would get
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0687,us tea kool-aid and any with just sugar
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0688,water and it's the worst thing for you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0689,soda was certainly fine not water okay
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0690,until the day she died may she rest in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0691,peace she never changed their mind on
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0692,that so you know growing up you don't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0693,have to maybe when you're young enough
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0694,you just accept that your mother's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0695,telling you they're at a point in time
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0696,something that's obviously so just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0697,absolutely unacceptable
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0698,becomes a problematic when it keeps
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0699,coming back and back and back over and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0700,over again so I'm just you know giving
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0701,one example I'm most most children
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0702,remember annoyances from their mothers
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0703,but I also remember is that without a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0704,father she raised six of us
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0705,and I loved her dearly I'd miss her
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0706,I probably didn't always treat her as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0707,well as I should have because of some of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0708,these annoying things which would you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0709,know as a young as a teenager and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0710,preteen Andrew they're difficult to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0711,accept so what was the question
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0712,yeah well I think I've given you a same
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0713,thing there's not I I think what it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0714,not a question of passing one if you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0715,talking about genes you you remind me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0716,you're named after my mother and you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0717,remind me of her you're a sweet and kind
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0718,in some sense you look like her new CD
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0719,teachers but some of those traits that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0720,she had and certainly that my father had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0721,we want to pay uh someone to anybody
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0722,what mistakes do you see me making that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0723,you have also made what would you advise
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0724,me to do
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0725,um I think you're a little too hard on
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0726,yourself sometimes which you criticize
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0727,me for being we do it in different ways
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0728,but I think you're really worried that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0729,your weren't good enough father or that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0730,you made too many mistakes or that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0731,weren't around enough and then maybe
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0732,you'd be remembered like that and that's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0733,just not the case and you're really hard
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0734,on yourself with that I think you should
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0735,cut yourself a break I think you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0736,pretty much ready to home with that I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0737,also don't you know I'm not totally down
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0738,on myself I've used seven children
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0739,first of all with three different
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0740,mothers but the word half is never used
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0741,in our family and you're as close with
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0742,your half-sister lincei is you would be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0743,with as you are with Julie who's your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0744,full sister that's to your credit I'm
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0745,saying you like made us stay a family
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0746,and I don't know anyone else that could
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0747,say that or a few people I mean I know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0748,siblings that are full that aren't as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0749,close as we are and people make mistakes
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0750,you make any that are any other parent
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0751,wouldn't have made you're just you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0752,really hard on yourself about all of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0753,that I don't think you should be well
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0754,I'm certainly not so so modest or hard
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0755,on myself that I wouldn't admit to that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0756,and boast and brag about it even I do
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0757,feel that the closeness and the family
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0758,ties that the seven of you and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0759,consequently my grandchildren your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0760,nieces and nephews and and even the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0761,great-grandchildren that's something
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0762,that was instilled in everybody and he's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0763,pretty tough it dissipates it hasn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0764,happened yet
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0765,all of those people will be at your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0766,wedding there's not a one of them you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0767,know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0768,I can't make it or this is that nobody
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0769,even thinks that they wouldn't be at
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0770,your wedding and and that's what kind of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0771,family that you have and you wouldn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0772,think that you wouldn't be somebody
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0773,else's let's say serious you have said
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0774,in the past like regrets that you've had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0775,about with raising any number of us and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0776,I just I don't think you should have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0777,them I mean you've said me we should
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0778,have been around more for Nick or you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0779,shouldn't have been as hard on the older
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0780,for kids for any number of things and I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0781,just you were a parent you were a young
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0782,parent and I just think that you made
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0783,mistakes as anyone would have but no one
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0784,sees you like that we all see you as a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0785,really good father and we we recognize
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0786,the fact that we are so close as a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0787,result of you telling us that family is
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0788,the most important and you should be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0789,proud of that because we're proud of it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0790,I am very proud of that I don't see
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0791,myself you know in a completely opposite
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0792,or negative if I don't see myself as a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0793,terrible father I just have regrets that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0794,as any or all of you we're growing up
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0795,that certain things could have been
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0796,right deal so it can't get that back I'm
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0797,certainly not I'm certainly pleased with
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0798,the products seven times over so that's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0799,not the issue
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0800,oh you turned out to be yeah wonderful I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0801,wouldn't change any one of you at all
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0802,maybe Goods girlfriend's boy I hope it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0803,gets back to Glenn it's not anything I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0804,haven't said to God but now other than
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0805,that I'm completely really completely
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0806,satisfied with the who all of you are so
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0807,in that regard I'm also not stupid I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0808,have to take some credit for that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0809,right but there are still plenty plenty
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0810,plenty regrets that I did do things or
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0811,didn't do things
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0812,you know could have done some things
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0813,differently yours or mine what quality
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0814,do you wish my fiance had but doesn't I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0815,I know rich pretty well and if he has
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0816,qualities or doesn't have Galax
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0817,qualities that are important to him in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0818,you in your life together I don't know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0819,of them you know having said that there
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0820,is one courted turning around the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0821,question but I've said this to you too
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0822,into him the one quality that he he does
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0823,have which perhaps at least your last
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0824,boyfriend didn't and consequently he
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0825,lost you okay now maybe that was meant
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0826,to be you know but he still hasn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0827,gotten over that you know it was too
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0828,late well okay and by the way as you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0829,well know I did not I don't have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0830,anything against Sebastian so it's it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0831,not that kind of a thing but what I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0832,perceived is that he didn't I don't see
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0833,you as
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0834,okay Sebastian I won't use his specific
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0835,thing but because it actually
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0836,disappeared a couple other of your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0837,boyfriend's too
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0838,and they didn't know what it it takes
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0839,for a man to please a woman and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0840,presumably to hold on to that woman if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0841,he wants to do that now if he's just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0842,playing or doesn't care than they did
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0843,you know how much does it matter but in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0844,the case of rich what I've observed
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0845,about him and what I believe is and will
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0846,be the case is that he loves you very
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0847,much
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0848,you don't want to lose him for sure but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0849,he certainly does not want to lose you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0850,and he's he's smart enough it's not just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0851,you know mental smartness but he's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0852,clever enough to do whatever it takes to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0853,make sure that you do stay with him and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0854,that was not necessarily a trait of his
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0855,predecessors and the result of it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0856,that you know they they did lose you and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0857,of course I'm prejudiced about you but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0858,I'd feel sorry for any man that loses
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0859,you it's just like he's a fighter and he
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0860,was just do you like makes it clear what
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0861,it is that he wants
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0862,and you like gorgeous for a team I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0863,I've never been a team like that before
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0864,it's different no it doesn't need to be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0865,like a comparison between him and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0866,everyone well what's the question
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0867,actually I turned around because I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0868,really don't have any knowledge
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0869,I'm sure he has some faults don't we all
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0870,but I don't have any knowledge of any
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0871,faults and certainly none that have you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0872,know come between you and him in your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0873,relationship
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0874,what's something I could do that would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0875,make you refuse to ever talk to me again
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0876,well
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0877,okay what's the one piece of advice you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0878,have for me regarding a successful
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0879,marriage no I sort of touched on it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0880,before but the implication is not that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0881,rich or the main is the one that has the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0882,total responsibility of making a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0883,marriage work and what I really said
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0884,about him knowing how to keep a woman I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0885,would say that about you too
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0886,in reference to him and did I said you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0887,know you you want to keep him being once
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0888,keep you and if you want you want to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0889,keep him then you it's not a question of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0890,acquiescing or being bullied or anything
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0891,like that clearly those are unacceptable
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0892,behaviors but you should do everything
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0893,that's possible to make the person that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0894,you love happy within reason okay
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0895,what have I done or what happened to me
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0896,that scared you the most
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0897,why because I said before that it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0898,something I appreciated about you sort
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0899,of but when you went to China and you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0900,didn't listen to us and then you fell
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0901,that was scary but I mean I wish it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0902,hadn't happened I don't know that I wish
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0903,you hadn't gone I think I just I don't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0904,know you're you're not going anywhere
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0905,anytime soon but you are getting older
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0906,and that scares me and I just don't want
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0907,anything to happen to you so it just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0908,felt reckless when you found out you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0909,were sick and the doctor said for you to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0910,stay and then you were like oh I need to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0911,go to China
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0912,I need to do that and in a weird way I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0913,can appreciate it I think I could at the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0914,time even as I was fighting with you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0915,about it but I just I knew if the tables
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0916,were turned you would never have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0917,advocated for me to do that you would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0918,have wanted me to start getting
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0919,treatment immediately and fix everything
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0920,and make it better and it was hard for
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0921,me to know that you that that wasn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0922,your first priority or maybe you just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0923,you look felt like you were invincible
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0924,or something and it just scared me that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0925,something was gonna happen and then when
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0926,you fell because like all the way worse
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0927,fear is happening at one time I think I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0928,forgot what the question was what was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0929,the question something I did that scared
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0930,you I think that was probably it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0931,scared you yet this yeah I think just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0932,you and again I understand it there
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0933,isn't even an explanation but I just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0934,it's I think sometimes you don't put
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0935,your health first like when you hardly
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0936,ever get sick and so when you do you you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0937,act like that you know like what you say
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0938,like I can never get sick or something
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0939,like that and it's just it's not the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0940,case I mean it's funny when we're like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0941,little kids and you say it but I'm not a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0942,little kid anymore and when you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0943,actually sick and something could really
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0944,happen it just felt so selfish I think
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0945,in that moment that you left which is
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0946,not fair it wasn't fair of me to look at
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0947,it like that but I just if God forbid
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0948,something had happened to you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0949,and you came back and the treatment had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0950,started too late and something happened
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0951,and you weren't here I think it would
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0952,have been really hard for me to forgive
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0953,that I do appreciate what you're saying
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0954,of course you shared that opinion with
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0955,not so much your mom she was convinced
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0956,but your other siblings but I did act on
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0957,the advice of doctors I just didn't go
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0958,away as a renegade so I know just wasn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0959,the safest thing yes the accident I had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0960,in China nothing to do with the other
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0961,you know that was just but that's still
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0962,sort of stems from the same thing it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0963,still stems from you being stubborn and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0964,like needing to climb to the top and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0965,needing to do that and it's it's like a
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0966,downfall and a positive because I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0967,appreciate that you do that and that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0968,are a fighter I mean I have that from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0969,you a mom like you guys just fight when
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0970,everything was happening with my lung
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0971,and I like I remember how scared you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0972,guys were and it was like we've flipped
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0973,roles I was like no it's gonna be fine I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0974,have this it's taken care of I'm going
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0975,to I'm going into surgery tomorrow you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0976,just need to hear that I mean I have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0977,that from you guys and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0978,I appreciate that quality but when the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0979,tables are turned and it feels like you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0980,like something really terrible could
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0981,have happened and I had no control over
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0982,it I didn't I mean what would I have
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0983,done if you weren't here you know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0984,well I'm gratified by how you feel how
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0985,you felt that would be do whatever to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0986,tell you what I don't care so it's not
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0987,that I wasn't aware of how all of you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0988,felt but again I wasn't not to put us
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0989,through torture during that time well
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0990,you really didn't want to do that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0991,know that's the thing I understand why
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0992,you did it but it was awful like going
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0993,through it it was really scary like just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0994,having that in the back of our heads
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0995,that you were delaying treatment and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0996,then we knew like when the accident
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0997,happened and everything it's just it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0998,like our worst fears were like all
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_0999,happening at the same time and it was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1000,and then to have you come back and be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1001,like feel like you would kind of like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1002,basically seen death almost is like you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1003,described it at that time it was just I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1004,was so upset and like angry with you for
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1005,having done that and again looking back
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1006,it's everything worked out and it's hard
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1007,for me to like feel still feel that way
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1008,but I was it's one of a few times that I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1009,was really angry with you for having
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1010,because it just felt so selfish well
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1011,your mom with me made the decision to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1012,parcel out updates on my condition and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1013,ward or not it was a she that made that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1014,decision I think it was exactly the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1015,appropriate thing to do now of course I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1016,know what's going through you but yeah
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1017,but if I didn't how would you feel we've
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1018,had that discussion but under the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1019,circumstances it wasn't like I was
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1020,around the corner where you know I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1021,I was in China there was a lot anybody
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1022,could do it was just the decision to go
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1023,the other part of it was unforeseen but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1024,the reason why you fell is the same
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1025,reason as to as like why you went it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1026,like you needed to just show that you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1027,could do it that you were not strong and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1028,sometimes I wish you would just do it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1029,and you did do it and that's the point
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1030,like I I can appreciate it and it also
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1031,just frustrates me at the same time
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1032,because so much of it could have the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1033,anxiety they like all of us went through
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1034,could have been avoided but I understand
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1035,why you did it I do I just well I just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1036,wish it hadn't happened it was awful
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1037,I do understand I'm not gonna say if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1038,something like that happened it would be
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1039,different because nothing like that's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1040,going to happen anymore I was it's an
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1041,easy hollow promise to make but I can't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1042,really say that in either of those
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1043,circumstances in the first case I had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1044,specific permission by several doctors
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1045,okay they assured me that putting it off
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1046,for a few weeks was not going to worsen
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1047,the problem and I know how you felt your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1048,mother felt that way too up to a point
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1049,then she just sort of backed off the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1050,accident I had in China we were walking
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1051,a narrow line there I mean if I were
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1052,close to dying or something a problem we
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1053,even if your mom had from the beginning
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1054,and I shouldn't say if I were I perhaps
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1055,was at one point but you've got over it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1056,quickly I wasn't I wasn't in danger and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1057,a point of dying and if your mother had
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1058,publicized that from the get-go there
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1059,would been the next day seven or more
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1060,no trips to China point I see yeah I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1061,don't say about missing the point it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1062,just like all of that happened and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1063,that's fine it's just I wish you hadn't
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1064,done it I wish you hadn't made the
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1065,decision to go everything that happened
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1066,from there on is to totally it's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1067,somewhat removed there's the fact that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1068,you went I wish you hadn't done that I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1069,wish you hadn't needed to take that risk
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1070,like I would hope that if something like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1071,that ever happened again in your face
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1072,with that decision that you'd remember
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1073,that there are a lot of people that care
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1074,about you being here and if the tables
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1075,were turned and a doctor said you can
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1076,start treatment immediately or you can
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1077,start treatment in three weeks you'd
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1078,have me there the next second if I could
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1079,that's my point okay points what what
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1080,are you worried about for me and my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1081,future I don't worry about a lot for you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1082,because of past experiences and your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1083,past performance I think you positioned
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1084,yourself career-wise to where you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1085,embarking in a you know a new venture
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1086,now but you you have your skills and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1087,your experience and you've distinguished
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1088,yourself and just about everything
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1089,you've done so I don't worry that if
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1090,something happened with your you know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1091,attempt at a business or anything else
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1092,you you always have the capacity to take
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1093,care of yourself so I don't really I
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1094,don't really worry about any of that I'm
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1095,worried about your health I know that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1096,you take very good care of yourself but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1097,I still worry about your health
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1098,and worry about your state of mind
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1099,worried that that you sometimes just
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1100,become overly stressed because you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1101,you know I've said this before but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1102,you're so organized that when you know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1103,something this big and the scheme of
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1104,things is amiss for you sometimes not
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1105,all the times it becomes a major cause
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1106,of stress and I worry about that I wish
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1107,you had the capacity to just dismiss it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1108,just not to expect such perfection from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1109,yourself but you usually get it from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1110,yourself that's the thing it's not like
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1111,you know here's a sloppy person looking
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1112,for perfection you generally are pretty
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1113,much perfection like turn
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1114,that's for you thank you for first okay
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1115,what's one thing you've learned from my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1116,relationships that you'll carry into
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1117,yours
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1118,family first I think like beyond I'm
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1119,seeking more broadly than you and mom
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1120,but I just I think I've learned from you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1121,how the importance of family and keeping
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1122,everyone together and just unconditional
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1123,love because you have that usually when
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1124,someone really pisses you off and they
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1125,you know family and unconditional life
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1126,well if you've learned those two things
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1127,I'm a success what do you see in my
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1128,future ten years from now well let's
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1129,start with the obvious ten years from
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1130,now hmm five six kids grandchildren
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1131,no I think in 10 years I'll see at least
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1132,a grandchild maybe more and maybe not
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1133,but that that's what I would predict
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1134,I see continued success in whatever
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1135,[Music]
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1136,financial or business ventures you're
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1137,entering into because that tendency for
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1138,perfection that I described as sometimes
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1139,being a negative it's certainly not all
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1140,negative and you have demonstrated in
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1141,the past that you have the capacity to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1142,distinguish yourself in anything that
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1143,you've tried to do and that's all
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1144,inclusive I don't recall ever your
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1145,having you know attempted to do
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1146,something and again not distinguishing
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1147,yourself yourself I recall your having
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1148,given some things up but not not
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1149,distinguishing yourself and of course
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1150,you know what I'm referring to
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1151,martial arts which you took you took it
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1152,to an extreme point you were very close
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1153,to the black belt you gave that up but
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1154,again I see only I see this relationship
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1155,that you have with rich as ideal I know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1156,that you care about for him and I know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1157,that he cares about you I don't have any
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1158,doubt of that and you have a good
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1159,support system you have a good you know
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1160,family support system a lot of it rich
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1161,has a you know decent family support
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1162,system and both of you are smart and
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1163,both of you will accomplish whatever you
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1164,want to accomplish to whatever degree
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1165,you want to accomplish so I see success
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1166,I see grandchildren I hope I see
Man004_Woman004_Transcription_1167,happiness all the time
