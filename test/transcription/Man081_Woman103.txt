Man081_Woman103_0001,I don't think I was annoyed by you
Man081_Woman103_0002,sometimes those people here take me
Man081_Woman103_0003,because I'm so not that way but I don't
Man081_Woman103_0004,think no we did we I think we instantly
Man081_Woman103_0005,connected so yeah but those things were
Man081_Woman103_0006,definitely very evident but I think it's
Man081_Woman103_0007,it's funny I've had other people tell me
Man081_Woman103_0008,like yeah you're like so nice and it
Man081_Woman103_0009,Rose really annoying it's so irritating
Man081_Woman103_0010,I'm glad you didn't have that reaction
Man081_Woman103_0011,okay what's your favorite thing about me
Man081_Woman103_0012,I would say like the first thing that
Man081_Woman103_0013,comes to mind and I can qualify this if
Man081_Woman103_0014,I think of something else but like first
Man081_Woman103_0015,thing is your authenticity like you're
Man081_Woman103_0016,really not afraid to be honest about who
Man081_Woman103_0017,you are about what you're feeling like
Man081_Woman103_0018,even when you're like you don't like
Man081_Woman103_0019,what you're feeling or you know you're
Man081_Woman103_0020,upset about something you do like you
Man081_Woman103_0021,you don't bullshit anyone like you
Man081_Woman103_0022,you're clear
Man081_Woman103_0023,you know you're honest with yourself
Man081_Woman103_0024,you're honest with other people you're
Man081_Woman103_0025,honest with God even if you're mad at
Man081_Woman103_0026,God but they're just like I really have
Man081_Woman103_0027,always respected that and I mean what
Man081_Woman103_0028,was the question it was the favorite
Man081_Woman103_0029,thing or like most priests what's your
Man081_Woman103_0030,favorite thing about me
Man081_Woman103_0031,yeah so I mean I think that's I think
Man081_Woman103_0032,there's other things I mean that I
Man081_Woman103_0033,probably enjoy more than honesty maybe a
Man081_Woman103_0034,sense of humor but thank you hmm how
Man081_Woman103_0035,would you define our relationship
Man081_Woman103_0036,friends know um our relationship is

Man081_Woman103_0065,and following up on the last question
Man081_Woman103_0066,I'd say like you and Judith are the two
Man081_Woman103_0067,women in the community that like remind
Man081_Woman103_0068,me most of my own sister mm-hmm

Man081_Woman103_0075,with like that honesty like there's a
Man081_Woman103_0076,rawness to that to you that I see in her
Man081_Woman103_0077,as well and so like even though in other
Man081_Woman103_0078,ways you're quite different people like

Man081_Woman103_0097,whole life basically so I feel like I
Man081_Woman103_0098,already know the answer and I don't want
Man081_Woman103_0099,to pour salt in the wound basically yeah
Man081_Woman103_0100,it's funny because your girlfriend has
Man081_Woman103_0101,asked me the same thing I know and I
Man081_Woman103_0102,almost slapped her when she told me that
Man081_Woman103_0103,I was like I can't even meet like you

Man081_Woman103_0114,okay I've really gonna put this on the
Man081_Woman103_0115,bottom and ask it later it's just so far
Man081_Woman103_0116,away for right now what made you decide
Man081_Woman103_0117,to become celibate why does it work for
Man081_Woman103_0118,you yeah thank you that's a double
Man081_Woman103_0119,question time first some of your
Man081_Woman103_0120,medicine I know sir so for the first
Man081_Woman103_0121,question what made me decide to become
Man081_Woman103_0122,celibate um probably just say like think
Man081_Woman103_0123,we're born celibate so like probably
Man081_Woman103_0124,what made me decide to remain turning
Man081_Woman103_0125,them into death I think it's I mean for
Man081_Woman103_0126,me it's always been not like primarily I
Man081_Woman103_0127,mean it's it's theology but it's like
Man081_Woman103_0128,it's Christology like it's
Man081_Woman103_0129,it's like my like my relationship with
Man081_Woman103_0130,Jesus is is such that like if I feel
Man081_Woman103_0131,like he's asking me to do something hard
Man081_Woman103_0132,like it's worth it and and so like
Man081_Woman103_0133,celibacy and like not pursuing
Man081_Woman103_0134,particularly in the past in Chicago you
Man081_Woman103_0135,know relationship with a guy that I was
Man081_Woman103_0136,deeply in love with mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0137,is be even for me it was a choice it was
Man081_Woman103_0138,like like the Lord who loves me and gave
Man081_Woman103_0139,himself for me like has asked me to do
Man081_Woman103_0140,something hard and I you know and so for
Man081_Woman103_0141,me it was it was it's always been kind
Man081_Woman103_0142,of a question of primary loyalties and
Man081_Woman103_0143,like it's funny because there's one time
Man081_Woman103_0144,I was that when I was at is a and like I
Man081_Woman103_0145,don't know if I told you this but I kind
Man081_Woman103_0146,of developed feelings for for one of my
Man081_Woman103_0147,housemates there and he's this young
Man081_Woman103_0148,German kid like I looked up to me and
Man081_Woman103_0149,yeah yeah and he and I don't think I'm
Man081_Woman103_0150,not sure he's very very physically
Man081_Woman103_0151,affectionate I'm not sure that meant he
Man081_Woman103_0152,was gay I think is more like he was 20
Man081_Woman103_0153,years old and he was trying to figure
Man081_Woman103_0154,out like yeah his own sexuality but and
Man081_Woman103_0155,in the end like I was thinking about
Man081_Woman103_0156,that and praying I was just like okay
Man081_Woman103_0157,God like I I have you know the whole
Man081_Woman103_0158,like you know traditional sexual ethic
Man081_Woman103_0159,like I see like I believe it like I see
Man081_Woman103_0160,the beauty of it I the you know more
Man081_Woman103_0161,recent revisions toward it you know
Man081_Woman103_0162,often I find that I find some are really
Man081_Woman103_0163,deep but most of them are really shallow
Man081_Woman103_0164,like why would you say no to love you
Man081_Woman103_0165,know something like that just like but
Man081_Woman103_0166,at the same time like I feel the force
Man081_Woman103_0167,of that it was like god I feel like
Man081_Woman103_0168,you're asking me over and over again to
Man081_Woman103_0169,say no to love
Man081_Woman103_0170,mm-hmm and I felt like really deep in my
Man081_Woman103_0171,in my heart just this whisper like you
Man081_Woman103_0172,have to trust me that that you're
Man081_Woman103_0173,actually saying yes to a deeper love and
Man081_Woman103_0174,a deeper life right and so for me that
Man081_Woman103_0175,was I don't know it's like why does it
Man081_Woman103_0176,work for me I feel like sometimes it
Man081_Woman103_0177,doesn't work for me
Man081_Woman103_0178,you know like that I'm far yeah I mean
Man081_Woman103_0179,that question is like I feel like I'm
Man081_Woman103_0180,far less contented than people imagine
Man081_Woman103_0181,mm-hmm and I reconsider my convictions
Man081_Woman103_0182,and behavior more often than people
Man081_Woman103_0183,would think but in some days I'm just
Man081_Woman103_0184,like you know as as soon as you know I
Man081_Woman103_0185,find any argument for like you know a
Man081_Woman103_0186,positive theology of gay relationships
Man081_Woman103_0187,like I'm there another days I feel like
Man081_Woman103_0188,you know even if if I would became side
Man081_Woman103_0189,a or whatever I hate that phrase like
Man081_Woman103_0190,that that I would still be celibate both
Man081_Woman103_0191,for like the sake of you know the
Man081_Woman103_0192,communities that are dear to me but also
Man081_Woman103_0193,just like that even if I were straight
Man081_Woman103_0194,like that there's I don't know I like it
Man081_Woman103_0195,that my life is a prophetic witness that
Man081_Woman103_0196,like sexuality as important as it is
Man081_Woman103_0197,like it's not the most important thing
Man081_Woman103_0198,and that like you can live a fully human
Man081_Woman103_0199,like enjoyable life without it so I
Man081_Woman103_0200,don't feel like it always works for me
Man081_Woman103_0201,like sometimes I hate it but I think
Man081_Woman103_0202,that's life but yeah I could ask that
Man081_Woman103_0203,question to anyone I'd be like no I kind
Man081_Woman103_0204,of like this doesn't work for me all the
Man081_Woman103_0205,time like yeah so do you so can I ask a
Man081_Woman103_0206,follow-up question do it do you think if
Man081_Woman103_0207,you were straight that you would still
Man081_Woman103_0208,be celibate like is that even something
Man081_Woman103_0209,that you can conceive of like I know
Man081_Woman103_0210,it's a very mm-hmm it's hard for me to
Man081_Woman103_0211,put right I can put myself in that
Man081_Woman103_0212,position like but you kind of mentioned
Man081_Woman103_0213,it so I was like is that something that
Man081_Woman103_0214,you feel like it's just I mean I feel
Man081_Woman103_0215,like before I really like
Man081_Woman103_0216,came to grips with myself like okay
Man081_Woman103_0217,these abiding attractions and affections
Man081_Woman103_0218,for men are not going away you're not
Man081_Woman103_0219,growing out of them this isn't something
Man081_Woman103_0220,that all boys kind of you know I'm
Man081_Woman103_0221,different than most people I think you
Man081_Woman103_0222,know up until then like I still was a
Man081_Woman103_0223,you know still very much like hey I'm
Man081_Woman103_0224,you know getting married like mmm you
Man081_Woman103_0225,know probably probably even before
Man081_Woman103_0226,college or like in college you know like
Man081_Woman103_0227,to a girl yeah to a girl of course and
Man081_Woman103_0228,and so like that wasn't even on my mind
Man081_Woman103_0229,and I was one of those you know who
Man081_Woman103_0230,joked I mean I inherited that same you
Man081_Woman103_0231,know shallow evangelical I thought that
Man081_Woman103_0232,that says like yep you know you know you
Man081_Woman103_0233,know thankfully that you know most of us
Man081_Woman103_0234,don't have that gift it's like you know
Man081_Woman103_0235,what you suck don't ya like you're
Man081_Woman103_0236,belittling yeah like the experience of a
Man081_Woman103_0237,lot of people not just you know being
Man081_Woman103_0238,celibacy right
Man081_Woman103_0239,yeah not business yeah not just those
Man081_Woman103_0240,who are single but like lots of
Man081_Woman103_0241,marriages have long-term seasons of no
Man081_Woman103_0242,sex involved you know and anyway it's
Man081_Woman103_0243,hard to say to like put myself where I
Man081_Woman103_0244,am now it's hard to even answer that
Man081_Woman103_0245,question and I'd say like there's still
Man081_Woman103_0246,it's not even like a fleeting hope you
Man081_Woman103_0247,know like I feel like I'm I'm kind of a
Man081_Woman103_0248,point where I'm like you know I'm thirty
Man081_Woman103_0249,years old like like I'm still a virgin
Man081_Woman103_0250,like I can yeah and I've made like I
Man081_Woman103_0251,found ways to make life meaningful
Man081_Woman103_0252,yeah so it's less of like a thing I look
Man081_Woman103_0253,I'm desperately hoping that there'll be
Man081_Woman103_0254,some internal change and that you know
Man081_Woman103_0255,I'll fall in love of a woman or like the
Man081_Woman103_0256,my convictions will change and I know
Man081_Woman103_0257,you know like marry a man I think like
Man081_Woman103_0258,there's still this intriguing
Man081_Woman103_0259,possibility of like you know what what
Man081_Woman103_0260,if I do meet a woman who's like very
Man081_Woman103_0261,like who's very understanding and who's
Man081_Woman103_0262,who
Man081_Woman103_0263,like could see me like beyond being gay
Man081_Woman103_0264,like see me and really love that yeah
Man081_Woman103_0265,and
Man081_Woman103_0266,be committed to the hard work that it
Man081_Woman103_0267,would take to make that kind of
Man081_Woman103_0268,relationship work I've seen those kind
Man081_Woman103_0269,of relationships work
Man081_Woman103_0270,I see also seen them fall apart mm-hmm I
Man081_Woman103_0271,feel like the ones that fall apart get
Man081_Woman103_0272,the most press the like they're still
Man081_Woman103_0273,part of me they're like whoa this beat
Man081_Woman103_0274,but it's not like this and hope yeah
Man081_Woman103_0275,yeah so I'm sure I understand it's a
Man081_Woman103_0276,question yeah
Man081_Woman103_0277,well you mentioned it so I was like is
Man081_Woman103_0278,that something that you've thought about
Man081_Woman103_0279,or that you can see I still think about
Man081_Woman103_0280,it yeah not like with I feel like even
Man081_Woman103_0281,it like five years ago that was a deep
Man081_Woman103_0282,long mm-hmm to marry a woman and that's
Man081_Woman103_0283,not the case anymore it's not something
Man081_Woman103_0284,I really want you know it's kind of like
Man081_Woman103_0285,are either one like a guy or just you
Man081_Woman103_0286,know that's the thing that's yeah I'm
Man081_Woman103_0287,sure it's still a stumbling block okay
Man081_Woman103_0288,okay it's your turn to ask me something
Man081_Woman103_0289,wait no no I think that was still my
Man081_Woman103_0290,question no no no no you're right yeah
Man081_Woman103_0291,okay I said this and then I have another
Man081_Woman103_0292,third question so you have nothing go
Man081_Woman103_0293,clean about when I asked double
Man081_Woman103_0294,questions and yes
Man081_Woman103_0295,speaking of assumed what do you think
Man081_Woman103_0296,this is nothing anyway what do you think
Man081_Woman103_0297,is the hardest thing for me right now
Man081_Woman103_0298,who are you you think thrown under the
Man081_Woman103_0299,bus so much I don't the hardest thing
Man081_Woman103_0300,for you um if you guess greetings I'm 30
Man081_Woman103_0301,papers getting ready to teach on Monday
Man081_Woman103_0302,in participating in level ground and
Man081_Woman103_0303,it's week eight almost week nine
Man081_Woman103_0304,currently and you're sick I think those
Man081_Woman103_0305,are to get away from the obvious I think
Man081_Woman103_0306,trying to break into your field maybe
Man081_Woman103_0307,there's a huge challenge cuz you're like
Man081_Woman103_0308,right there you've done so much work you
Man081_Woman103_0309,deserve it but at some point they're
Man081_Woman103_0310,exactly you have to like pop pop the
Man081_Woman103_0311,bubble and like break into that next
Man081_Woman103_0312,realm of like professional work so
Man081_Woman103_0313,that's a hard place to be in for me I
Man081_Woman103_0314,think you know I feel like it's a really
Man081_Woman103_0315,hard place to be in like for your morale
Man081_Woman103_0316,you know cuz you're like I'm qualified I
Man081_Woman103_0317,can do this I'm smart I'm pretty I'm
Man081_Woman103_0318,look at all those eyes come on somebody
Man081_Woman103_0319,give me a job what do you think is the
Man081_Woman103_0320,hardest thing about the choices I've
Man081_Woman103_0321,made
Man081_Woman103_0322,okay well the get away from the obvious
Man081_Woman103_0323,no living with Morgan my god I think I
Man081_Woman103_0324,think the hardest thing is or one of the
Man081_Woman103_0325,hardest things is when you you had such
Man081_Woman103_0326,a journey you have had such a journey so
Man081_Woman103_0327,far for reconciling integrating faith
Man081_Woman103_0328,your faith in sexuality and your family
Man081_Woman103_0329,doesn't understand that and doesn't
Man081_Woman103_0330,respond and really helpful ways I like
Man081_Woman103_0331,just ignoring it all together like that
Man081_Woman103_0332,mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0333,so you're like trying to navigate that
Man081_Woman103_0334,and you know still like you know figure
Man081_Woman103_0335,out some of your own doubts you know
Man081_Woman103_0336,theological you attic weave and like you
Man081_Woman103_0337,know being in the midst of a society
Man081_Woman103_0338,where like this is
Man081_Woman103_0339,all we freakin talk about sometimes
Man081_Woman103_0340,mm-hmm and feeling I think feeling alone
Man081_Woman103_0341,we're feeling isolated is one of the
Man081_Woman103_0342,hardest yeah that's probably true like
Man081_Woman103_0343,we need a cry break I don't cry so okay
Man081_Woman103_0344,oh this is my question a long way I
Man081_Woman103_0345,don't say that but this is my double
Man081_Woman103_0346,question I think I would have known
Man081_Woman103_0347,anyways because it's a little bit
Man081_Woman103_0348,different language what is your hope for
Man081_Woman103_0349,how churches will learn to interact with
Man081_Woman103_0350,sexual minorities and follow-up question
Man081_Woman103_0351,is that hope realistic the hope is that
Man081_Woman103_0352,on a very basic and maybe not basic so
Man081_Woman103_0353,for me I think the most basic level is
Man081_Woman103_0354,interpersonal you and I you know you and
Man081_Woman103_0355,I are friends like even though we have
Man081_Woman103_0356,hold opposite points of view but if you
Man081_Woman103_0357,take that to the next level and say okay
Man081_Woman103_0358,in the realm of like religion the next
Man081_Woman103_0359,realm I think would be church like
Man081_Woman103_0360,church homes Church and people like one
Man081_Woman103_0361,specific church meaning like one
Man081_Woman103_0362,building that holds not like the Baptist
Man081_Woman103_0363,denomination but like one specific
Man081_Woman103_0364,church so is it possible for that one
Man081_Woman103_0365,church to hold differing to hold us in
Man081_Woman103_0366,the same body of believers and be a
Man081_Woman103_0367,functioning unit I think there's
Man081_Woman103_0368,different levels to even that like
Man081_Woman103_0369,there's the interpersonal level and then
Man081_Woman103_0370,there's like the policy level so what I
Man081_Woman103_0371,would hope is that that one specific
Man081_Woman103_0372,church would become like a container and
Man081_Woman103_0373,a container for I guess conflict almost
Man081_Woman103_0374,like that's how like at the symposium on
Man081_Woman103_0375,last week like they were talking about
Man081_Woman103_0376,were you there for that one no but I've
Man081_Woman103_0377,read oh my god yeah like the some like
Man081_Woman103_0378,hope being able to like we need a
Man081_Woman103_0379,container that is going to hold our
Man081_Woman103_0380,conflict almost like and to be able to
Man081_Woman103_0381,like you know have the conflict within
Man081_Woman103_0382,this very protected and very loving and
Man081_Woman103_0383,mutual sphere I think is the only way
Man081_Woman103_0384,that you know any of those differences
Man081_Woman103_0385,in conflicts can be worked out and I
Man081_Woman103_0386,think it's gonna take a lot on the
Man081_Woman103_0387,policy side that's the side that I'm
Man081_Woman103_0388,like you know like I really because the
Man081_Woman103_0389,bottom line is someone's gonna be
Man081_Woman103_0390,unhappy you know like someone is going
Man081_Woman103_0391,to say like I don't agree with that you
Man081_Woman103_0392,know and they're gonna have to decide
Man081_Woman103_0393,whether or not and the hope I guess the
Man081_Woman103_0394,hope is that on some level everyone
Man081_Woman103_0395,would feel uncomfortable with something
Man081_Woman103_0396,you know and that there would be equal
Man081_Woman103_0397,slash mutual discomfort but still within
Man081_Woman103_0398,the realm of saying like yes I can like
Man081_Woman103_0399,the article we read for Aaron's class
Man081_Woman103_0400,about making moral decisions in the
Man081_Woman103_0401,sense that like how far away from my own
Man081_Woman103_0402,opinions can someone get and still look
Man081_Woman103_0403,like Jesus enough for me to welcome them
Man081_Woman103_0404,into community you know I mean so that's
Man081_Woman103_0405,kind of like the way I conceive of it is
Man081_Woman103_0406,it possible is it realistic I don't know
Man081_Woman103_0407,I don't have a lot of hope for it a lot
Man081_Woman103_0408,of times and I mean like what I was
Man081_Woman103_0409,gonna say in the car
Man081_Woman103_0410,one thing I was gonna say it was like my
Man081_Woman103_0411,own personal desires are different than
Man081_Woman103_0412,that on some levels like I don't want to
Man081_Woman103_0413,compromise I don't want like I feel like
Man081_Woman103_0414,like no you stupid straight people can
Man081_Woman103_0415,you know fucking compromise something on
Man081_Woman103_0416,your own for once you know what I mean
Man081_Woman103_0417,like that's like my gut reaction to it
Man081_Woman103_0418,but like people like you and people like
Man081_Woman103_0419,Matt and people like other friends that
Man081_Woman103_0420,I have who are
Man081_Woman103_0421,like gay and Sullivan make me like
Man081_Woman103_0422,rethink that and say like or even like
Man081_Woman103_0423,ex gay people I know and deeply love
Man081_Woman103_0424,like those people make me say like can't
Man081_Woman103_0425,think that like you can think imma see
Man081_Woman103_0426,of being videotaped and put on the
Man081_Woman103_0427,internet so but I understand that like
Man081_Woman103_0428,those are my those are my gut level
Man081_Woman103_0429,reactions at that but do I believe in
Man081_Woman103_0430,something higher and something better
Man081_Woman103_0431,even though it's really really hard for
Man081_Woman103_0432,me to say that you know what I mean so
Man081_Woman103_0433,yeah I don't know if it's realistic I
Man081_Woman103_0434,have no idea well just have to see what
Man081_Woman103_0435,do you think is the most important
Man081_Woman103_0436,lesson I'm learning at this stage in my
Man081_Woman103_0437,life oh listen I'm only 27 so you got
Man081_Woman103_0438,three years on me
Man081_Woman103_0439,at this stage of my life you brought up
Man081_Woman103_0440,the age difference so that's what it
Man081_Woman103_0441,feels like to me well I mean honestly my
Man081_Woman103_0442,sister's 27 and so like I feel like with
Man081_Woman103_0443,her we've had to navigate that I think
Man081_Woman103_0444,like our release it was so different but
Man081_Woman103_0445,like would that made me like like I was
Man081_Woman103_0446,always like the big brother that was
Man081_Woman103_0447,like that knew everything and you know
Man081_Woman103_0448,and you know I taught her stuff and like
Man081_Woman103_0449,kind of paved the way for her and I like
Man081_Woman103_0450,coached her into the stuff and then like
Man081_Woman103_0451,she became an adult and she's like I
Man081_Woman103_0452,want us to be equals and shit like and
Man081_Woman103_0453,she fought for that and like I fought
Man081_Woman103_0454,you know I guess it's her like for a
Man081_Woman103_0455,while until like we were like I got you
Man081_Woman103_0456,could see like how my like always
Man081_Woman103_0457,thinking I knew more than her was was
Man081_Woman103_0458,hurtful to her mm-hm
Man081_Woman103_0459,and so like we like over a period of
Man081_Woman103_0460,years like got to this point
Man081_Woman103_0461,of a quality and then she's like you
Man081_Woman103_0462,know when she finally felt like a firm
Man081_Woman103_0463,and respected as equal she's like oh but
Man081_Woman103_0464,you're always a big brother I always
Man081_Woman103_0465,look up to you I'm like no it's anyway
Man081_Woman103_0466,like take this in that you know in that
Man081_Woman103_0467,kind of line
Man081_Woman103_0468,I honestly think you learning how to be
Man081_Woman103_0469,an adult right now and you've been
Man081_Woman103_0470,biologically one for a long time they're
Man081_Woman103_0471,like like I've watched even in the year
Man081_Woman103_0472,and a half since I met you like the
Man081_Woman103_0473,decisions you make like our more thought
Man081_Woman103_0474,through now like you know like going

Man081_Woman103_0481,prioritizing your life like reconciling
Man081_Woman103_0482,finances like I'm just like I feel like
Man081_Woman103_0483,like doing all those things and like
Man081_Woman103_0484,delaying gratification you know choosing
Man081_Woman103_0485,to do work and study and just general
Man081_Woman103_0486,life ya admin rather than just like fun
Man081_Woman103_0487,yeah it's like stuff adults do so like
Man081_Woman103_0488,you hear that you're hearing where I
Man081_Woman103_0489,kind of like yes no I'm very aware that
Man081_Woman103_0490,I'm surrendering to adult life it is a
Man081_Woman103_0491,surrender
Man081_Woman103_0492,I mean you fought I fought longer longer
Man081_Woman103_0493,than a lot of people I know stubborn
Man081_Woman103_0494,yeah that's good to know yeah what would
Man081_Woman103_0495,make you end our friendship dang I don't

Man081_Woman103_0497,aggressive question - it's very
Man081_Woman103_0498,aggressive not what would make our
Man081_Woman103_0499,friendship and what would make you end
Man081_Woman103_0500,it what would make me yeah like what
Man081_Woman103_0501,would you have to do for me to end it I

Man081_Woman103_0503,general like they may
Man081_Woman103_0504,I mean I can see like if we had a huge
Man081_Woman103_0505,fight or something an argument and we
Man081_Woman103_0506,didn't talk about it and we just kind of
Man081_Woman103_0507,like drifted apart but there's no like I
Man081_Woman103_0508,can't imagine like I don't know I mean
Man081_Woman103_0509,you just have to be a totally different
Man081_Woman103_0510,person for me to imagine an action that
Man081_Woman103_0511,you would take that would be so drastic
Man081_Woman103_0512,for me to say like I just can't even be
Man081_Woman103_0513,a friend anymore
Man081_Woman103_0514,like you'd have to steal my girlfriend
Man081_Woman103_0515,or something you know and that's not
Man081_Woman103_0516,gonna happen so um you know it's
Man081_Woman103_0517,something on that level of like it's
Man081_Woman103_0518,just not a friend move you know I mean
Man081_Woman103_0519,like we just actually let's just call it
Man081_Woman103_0520,what it is we're just not friends
Man081_Woman103_0521,anymore but I really don't see our
Man081_Woman103_0522,dynamic I was like we really just hate
Man081_Woman103_0523,talking about things and we're really
Man081_Woman103_0524,bad at compliment so because each of one
Man081_Woman103_0525,of these is like mentally and
Man081_Woman103_0526,emotionally intense yeah okay how have I
Man081_Woman103_0527,changed since we met and how do you
Man081_Woman103_0528,honestly feel about it honestly I feel
Man081_Woman103_0529,like I've seen a few changes
Man081_Woman103_0530,one is the adulthood thing that I
Man081_Woman103_0531,already talked about which i think is
Man081_Woman103_0532,great another I feel like so I feel like
Man081_Woman103_0533,I have a lot of ambivalence and we
Man081_Woman103_0534,haven't really talked about this but
Man081_Woman103_0535,it's really good that we do like with
Man081_Woman103_0536,your look personally I'm really glad
Man081_Woman103_0537,that you stayed here rather than going
Man081_Woman103_0538,to Texas
Man081_Woman103_0539,me too on so many levels
Man081_Woman103_0540,yeah I think like so you're you're more
Man081_Woman103_0541,like I feel like the change that I've
Man081_Woman103_0542,seen
Man081_Woman103_0543,with your kind of more like I'm leaving
Man081_Woman103_0544,kind of x-gamer old like I'm I'm being
Man081_Woman103_0545,like I'm committing to moving in a
Man081_Woman103_0546,direction toward like a long-term
Man081_Woman103_0547,relationship with a woman and and then
Man081_Woman103_0548,actually like finding one and like like
Man081_Woman103_0549,finding ways to to shift theology and
Man081_Woman103_0550,like and like integrate your faith with
Man081_Woman103_0551,your sexuality like like I feel like
Man081_Woman103_0552,that's been hard for me too
Man081_Woman103_0553,to know like how to respond to mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0554,because I don't know hand like it's
Man081_Woman103_0555,really good to see you so happy mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0556,you know like during when I first met
Man081_Woman103_0557,you and not just that summer but like
Man081_Woman103_0558,that fall that winter I mean I didn't
Man081_Woman103_0559,know if you're gonna make it sometimes
Man081_Woman103_0560,during that winter when you and she will
Man081_Woman103_0561,not be naked you know you know you were
Man081_Woman103_0562,treated really badly you know and yeah
Man081_Woman103_0563,but also like there was just was a lot
Man081_Woman103_0564,of inner turmoil mm-hmm just seeing that
Man081_Woman103_0565,and like so as your friend like to see
Man081_Woman103_0566,you like more confident more happy like
Man081_Woman103_0567,in a relationship with someone who who
Man081_Woman103_0568,like really loves you
Man081_Woman103_0569,not just is using you mm-hmm like that
Man081_Woman103_0570,brings me a lot of joy and like I see a
Man081_Woman103_0571,lot of really good things from your
Man081_Woman103_0572,relationship Morgan hmm
Man081_Woman103_0573,and yeah at the same time like I don't
Man081_Woman103_0574,think that's what God wants mm-hmm and I
Man081_Woman103_0575,don't think that like your ultimate
Man081_Woman103_0576,flourishing is gonna come from that yeah
Man081_Woman103_0577,and so so I mean that's like the change
Man081_Woman103_0578,and that's honestly how I feel about it
Man081_Woman103_0579,like there's a lot of I'm like both
Man081_Woman103_0580,really happy and really sad about it
Man081_Woman103_0581,I think in some ways like it's like you
Man081_Woman103_0582,have to live your life you know yeah and
Man081_Woman103_0583,you're responsible before God for the
Man081_Woman103_0584,choices you make and you know but I was
Man081_Woman103_0585,hoping for a while like that like as you
Man081_Woman103_0586,were going through that deep rustling
Man081_Woman103_0587,process and integration that like you
Man081_Woman103_0588,come to some more conclusion and like
Man081_Woman103_0589,life practice that I am and then like I
Man081_Woman103_0590,mean I think it's some ways that make
Man081_Woman103_0591,what we have even even deeper of like
Man081_Woman103_0592,like I think we found ways across
Man081_Woman103_0593,disagreements and choices like to really
Man081_Woman103_0594,love one another well but there and like
Man081_Woman103_0595,I don't think this divides us but like
Man081_Woman103_0596,it is a difference you know and it does
Man081_Woman103_0597,make it more complicated
Man081_Woman103_0598,mm-hm and yeah I just I don't feel like
Man081_Woman103_0599,I don't yeah I don't even know like so
Man081_Woman103_0600,I'm being really honest I don't want you
Man081_Woman103_0601,to feel this like a like you abandoned
Man081_Woman103_0602,me you're kind of thing but because it's
Man081_Woman103_0603,not that but it's more like like it's
Man081_Woman103_0604,it's a really lonely sometimes
Man081_Woman103_0605,mm-hmm being gay a little bit and so
Man081_Woman103_0606,like having others not like not to be
Man081_Woman103_0607,like you know to prove like it's us
Man081_Woman103_0608,against the world or like you know we
Man081_Woman103_0609,have more people on our side or anything
Man081_Woman103_0610,stupid like that they're just like yeah
Man081_Woman103_0611,I just let you know but it's nice to
Man081_Woman103_0612,have someone it's nice yeah that's my
Man081_Woman103_0613,totally get that
Man081_Woman103_0614,yeah I mean there's I think there's a
Man081_Woman103_0615,lot of things that we avoid because of
Man081_Woman103_0616,that like emotional places that we avoid
Man081_Woman103_0617,talking about because of that I know I
Man081_Woman103_0618,do because I don't want to cause you
Man081_Woman103_0619,pain and I feel the same way like you
Man081_Woman103_0620,know like I like and absolutely because
Man081_Woman103_0621,I you are you worry me Joshua like
Man081_Woman103_0622,you're think it's just you're older and
Man081_Woman103_0623,you're smarter and like oh maybe I'm
Man081_Woman103_0624,doing this wrong like this is you know
Man081_Woman103_0625,what I mean
Man081_Woman103_0626,I mean I I think about that you know
Man081_Woman103_0627,like I really do wonder because you
Man081_Woman103_0628,are the first person I've ever met like
Man081_Woman103_0629,I mean coming to California was the
Man081_Woman103_0630,first first gay Christians I ever met
Man081_Woman103_0631,ever who were living full and good lives
Man081_Woman103_0632,as gay and as Christians and like in
Man081_Woman103_0633,relationships are seeking relationships
Man081_Woman103_0634,and you are the first person I've ever
Man081_Woman103_0635,met who has a full like view of life as
Man081_Woman103_0636,a gay and celibate like you're the first
Man081_Woman103_0637,case element who I've ever met who
Man081_Woman103_0638,didn't your your point and your whole
Man081_Woman103_0639,reason for living wasn't denying
Man081_Woman103_0640,something but it was living into
Man081_Woman103_0641,something and that terrifies me because
Man081_Woman103_0642,I'm like oh like that I could have
Man081_Woman103_0643,gotten on board with possibly you know
Man081_Woman103_0644,what I mean yeah and and I feel like I
Man081_Woman103_0645,often don't bring up stuff you know
Man081_Woman103_0646,because it's just like I you get enough
Man081_Woman103_0647,judgment like from other people mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0648,and like I'm like I don't want to add to
Man081_Woman103_0649,that like and that's not even what I
Man081_Woman103_0650,have but like yeah it's whole I have a
Man081_Woman103_0651,hard time thinking what I can write but
Man081_Woman103_0652,it cuz it's not it's not judging you but
Man081_Woman103_0653,it's like like knowing that I disagree
Man081_Woman103_0654,with something that was like not only
Man081_Woman103_0655,very dear like very central to you like
Man081_Woman103_0656,as a person but like a relationship
Man081_Woman103_0657,that's you know like really really
Man081_Woman103_0658,special and my friends with her as well
Man081_Woman103_0659,yeah like I think I just often just
Man081_Woman103_0660,don't go there because I'm like hey
Man081_Woman103_0661,what's the point like you already know
Man081_Woman103_0662,what I think and you know that I like I
Man081_Woman103_0663,love you across our differences and you
Man081_Woman103_0664,feel the same way and so like yeah I
Man081_Woman103_0665,talk about it if it's just gonna make us
Man081_Woman103_0666,sad yeah that's kinda how I feel about
Man081_Woman103_0667,you so but it yeah you're right it does
Man081_Woman103_0668,kind of create like there's that barrier
Man081_Woman103_0669,there for sure the rainbow-colored all
Man081_Woman103_0670,fit in our room yeah was that your
Man081_Woman103_0671,question you're like nope how's your
Man081_Woman103_0672,question okay
Man081_Woman103_0673,so bad at this game well we basically
Man081_Woman103_0674,just answer this
Man081_Woman103_0675,what do you honestly think I think about
Man081_Woman103_0676,your girlfriend she's awesome judging
Man081_Woman103_0677,well not judging from but knowing having
Man081_Woman103_0678,known that she asked you about the
Man081_Woman103_0679,situation we talked about earlier you
Man081_Woman103_0680,might think she's a little insensitive
Man081_Woman103_0681,or too forward just say it nicely I'm
Man081_Woman103_0682,really sorry about that by the way I was
Man081_Woman103_0683,like I'll give you a mulligan Morgan
Man081_Woman103_0684,yeah but that's it that's it yeah yeah I
Man081_Woman103_0685,couldn't believe that so possibly a
Man081_Woman103_0686,little bit insensitive into forward but
Man081_Woman103_0687,also yeah fun and loving and kind she's
Man081_Woman103_0688,great she is and I feel like you you
Man081_Woman103_0689,both offer a lot to one another you know
Man081_Woman103_0690,like there's there's aspects of
Man081_Woman103_0691,insecurities in both of you that like
Man081_Woman103_0692,the other helps bring confidence to and
Man081_Woman103_0693,yeah I mean I've really I think that's
Man081_Woman103_0694,one of the things I appreciate most
Man081_Woman103_0695,about your relationship this is like
Man081_Woman103_0696,it's a good relationship Damon you
Man081_Woman103_0697,really care for one another and yeah I
Man081_Woman103_0698,think very highly of her that unpleasant
Man081_Woman103_0699,experience no soon sometimes people make
Man081_Woman103_0700,mistakes this has fewer mistakes only
Man081_Woman103_0701,one no you get one
Man081_Woman103_0702,okay how do you think my current
Man081_Woman103_0703,relationship with my girlfriend is
Man081_Woman103_0704,affecting me and my relationship with
Man081_Woman103_0705,God to God I also kind of talked about
Man081_Woman103_0706,this earlier yeah I haven't thought too
Man081_Woman103_0707,much I mean honestly it's a lot of
Man081_Woman103_0708,judgment in this question like judge
Man081_Woman103_0709,judge judge my relationship judge my
Man081_Woman103_0710,relationship with God too and then put
Man081_Woman103_0711,them together
Man081_Woman103_0712,I have to think about that more I'm not
Man081_Woman103_0713,like I'm willing to answer it but I just
Man081_Woman103_0714,agreed anything you say it's kind of
Man081_Woman103_0715,like it's awful yeah I would I would
Man081_Woman103_0716,love it it down and I don't think I'd
Man081_Woman103_0717,love for you to answer it either now
Man081_Woman103_0718,we're like in the car right now for me
Man081_Woman103_0719,answer for myself yeah absolutely not
Man081_Woman103_0720,not me telling you definitely yeah
Man081_Woman103_0721,extrapolating to judgments from exactly
Man081_Woman103_0722,okay
Man081_Woman103_0723,should I go again because I'm sure you
Man081_Woman103_0724,said I had two extra ones anyway so do
Man081_Woman103_0725,you ever think about changing your
Man081_Woman103_0726,choice like I did what's that scene
Man081_Woman103_0727,several times a week yeah yeah anything
Man081_Woman103_0728,I kind of the biggest thing is just like
Man081_Woman103_0729,it's funny too because it does any like
Man081_Woman103_0730,the brothers they so like they saw
Man081_Woman103_0731,emphasize God's love and even though I
Man081_Woman103_0732,mean I'd say most of them are fairly
Man081_Woman103_0733,traditional in their sexual ethics like
Man081_Woman103_0734,they're like for them their biggest
Man081_Woman103_0735,thing is like these like German and
Man081_Woman103_0736,French and like Belgian and Italian kids
Man081_Woman103_0737,like are trying to figure out like is
Man081_Woman103_0738,there more to life than like you know
Man081_Woman103_0739,sex in my education and yeah like does
Man081_Woman103_0740,God even exist and so for them like
Man081_Woman103_0741,they're not talking about like so and
Man081_Woman103_0742,they have I mean I've talked with them
Man081_Woman103_0743,like how do you your handle when gay
Man081_Woman103_0744,kids come out you think it happens all
Man081_Woman103_0745,the time we were just like like we don't
Man081_Woman103_0746,even say what we what we think we just
Man081_Woman103_0747,were just like you know help them
Man081_Woman103_0748,process like their own thoughts and then
Man081_Woman103_0749,talk about how much God loves them and I
Man081_Woman103_0750,think like being surrounded by that
Man081_Woman103_0751,so I'd say like in terms of my own like
Man081_Woman103_0752,that's affected my view of God - yeah I
Man081_Woman103_0753,think for in a largely a positive way so
Man081_Woman103_0754,like even when it comes to like you know
Man081_Woman103_0755,my my mental and theological convictions
Man081_Woman103_0756,like we are just in my mind and I think
Man081_Woman103_0757,they're rude it outside you know
Man081_Woman103_0758,yeah I'm just me there's like lots of
Man081_Woman103_0759,other people that have thought that like
Man081_Woman103_0760,that's that stop saying but even though
Man081_Woman103_0761,like say I got an emotional level oh my
Man081_Woman103_0762,god
Man081_Woman103_0763,would you really like not be okay with
Man081_Woman103_0764,this you know so but yeah I mean the
Man081_Woman103_0765,biggest thing is you know trying to
Man081_Woman103_0766,figure out like what what pleases God
Man081_Woman103_0767,hmm like that's always the first
Man081_Woman103_0768,question yeah and I mean I think if that
Man081_Woman103_0769,were in my like in my mind and my heart
Man081_Woman103_0770,satisfactorily answered mm-hmm I don't
Man081_Woman103_0771,know that anything else would stop me
Man081_Woman103_0772,yeah when I initially was thinking about
Man081_Woman103_0773,this like five years ago when in like
Man081_Woman103_0774,crisis mode okay do I really like what I
Man081_Woman103_0775,really believe about this I'm like yeah
Man081_Woman103_0776,I am I was holding and you know a deep
Man081_Woman103_0777,desire from coming to pass I mean that
Man081_Woman103_0778,was the biggest thing you know which I
Man081_Woman103_0779,had a lot to do with interpretation of
Man081_Woman103_0780,Scripture and you know community I mean
Man081_Woman103_0781,thinking about my parents and you know
Man081_Woman103_0782,would give me pause something cuz like
Man081_Woman103_0783,in my family like if I brought a
Man081_Woman103_0784,boyfriend home for Thanksgiving mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0785,my my dad would not him a little super
Man081_Woman103_0786,well mm-hmm like I think he would be
Man081_Woman103_0787,he'd be really upset my mom would like
Man081_Woman103_0788,be surprised and like but she probably
Man081_Woman103_0789,finds some way like to like I mean maybe
Man081_Woman103_0790,even change with what she believes yeah
Man081_Woman103_0791,you know in order to like open up space
Man081_Woman103_0792,for me and my sister be like it's about
Man081_Woman103_0793,time you know
Man081_Woman103_0794,Oh anyway she's like she's like she's
Man081_Woman103_0795,like I can't stand it that trick she's
Man081_Woman103_0796,not pro-gamers like this is like
Man081_Woman103_0797,something that's so important me and
Man081_Woman103_0798,like you know all this stuff and just
Man081_Woman103_0799,like that's day away that's my family so
Man081_Woman103_0800,I was like you know and dad mom me
Man081_Woman103_0801,sister and like we're on the spectrum so
Man081_Woman103_0802,but I mean think that enough had stopped
Man081_Woman103_0803,me
Man081_Woman103_0804,probably not pause I think the only
Man081_Woman103_0805,other thing that would stop me and I
Man081_Woman103_0806,kind of alluded to it earlier is feeling
Man081_Woman103_0807,like the things I'm called to you know
Man081_Woman103_0808,like racial reconciliation like trying
Man081_Woman103_0809,to flip the tables on your liberal
Man081_Woman103_0810,capitalism and like you know but tear
Man081_Woman103_0811,down the you know the influence of the
Man081_Woman103_0812,rich in politics stuff like that yeah
Man081_Woman103_0813,like those are hard enough things in
Man081_Woman103_0814,conservative Protestant communities and
Man081_Woman103_0815,I'm like if even if I think if I came to
Man081_Woman103_0816,the conclusion that their their sexual
Man081_Woman103_0817,scruples were stupid mm-hmm for me I
Man081_Woman103_0818,think it would definitely be a judgement
Man081_Woman103_0819,call of like like this is this would
Man081_Woman103_0820,throw them off to such an extent that
Man081_Woman103_0821,I'd lose them as an audience and the
Man081_Woman103_0822,other very people like I'm trying to
Man081_Woman103_0823,reach and so then it would just become
Man081_Woman103_0824,it become a question priorities and I'm
Man081_Woman103_0825,not sure what I would choose yeah I'm
Man081_Woman103_0826,sure you would choose yeah like I used
Man081_Woman103_0827,really though like like I think probably
Man081_Woman103_0828,you know ask me Monday Wednesday Friday
Man081_Woman103_0829,Saturday Sunday I probably say I choose
Man081_Woman103_0830,the husband you know but like a couple
Man081_Woman103_0831,days a week I'm like you know what I
Man081_Woman103_0832,would be I would be okay with like I
Man081_Woman103_0833,continuing to hold back on I'm like you
Man081_Woman103_0834,know a sexual relationship if that meant
Man081_Woman103_0835,that like I could have like do really
Man081_Woman103_0836,fruitful justice and reconciliation work
Man081_Woman103_0837,you know if that weren't the case like
Man081_Woman103_0838,if you had to like very starkly choose
Man081_Woman103_0839,right right and this is ideally a bit of
Man081_Woman103_0840,a weird
Man081_Woman103_0841,and ideally it wouldn't be lunch I had
Man081_Woman103_0842,to yeah even that so like beaming that
Man081_Woman103_0843,that's a vocational question and there
Man081_Woman103_0844,goes back to like the first thing of
Man081_Woman103_0845,like how do you please God so that's
Man081_Woman103_0846,really there's only one thing yep is
Man081_Woman103_0847,that your question we're getting close
Man081_Woman103_0848,mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0849,what makes this friendship work the way
Man081_Woman103_0850,it does mmm I think our mutual weirdness
Man081_Woman103_0851,definitely I think and I really like
Man081_Woman103_0852,hugs and there's a lot of trust yeah for
Man081_Woman103_0853,sure
Man081_Woman103_0854,trust hug in this I seriously I think
Man081_Woman103_0855,that's what holds it together
Man081_Woman103_0856,probably so get your head in the game oh
Man081_Woman103_0857,yeah this is my question
Man081_Woman103_0858,who is your favorite person from today
Man081_Woman103_0859,and why oh that's a great question
Man081_Woman103_0860,[Music]
Man081_Woman103_0861,okay I can't just alone one but I'll
Man081_Woman103_0862,give a couple Beckett you know sorry
Man081_Woman103_0863,this is what I do
Man081_Woman103_0864,I changed the questions brother Emil he
Man081_Woman103_0865,was like my mentor he was twice my age
Man081_Woman103_0866,when I was there he's like almost 60 now
Man081_Woman103_0867,and he joined the community was 20
Man081_Woman103_0868,he's Wow he was like someone who helped
Man081_Woman103_0869,me put into like InFocus the things I
Man081_Woman103_0870,was already feeling and that I'd already
Man081_Woman103_0871,been living uh-huh but like he's like
Man081_Woman103_0872,he's like Joshua if you're gonna be
Man081_Woman103_0873,celibate he's like take it from me you
Man081_Woman103_0874,can't it cannot be about primarily focus
Man081_Woman103_0875,on deprivation yeah like your priority
Man081_Woman103_0876,needs to be opening yourself up to
Man081_Woman103_0877,beauty and and just like you know the
Man081_Woman103_0878,the yes has to be deeper than the no and
Man081_Woman103_0879,like you know and like all this stuff
Man081_Woman103_0880,yeah and he was just and just for
Man081_Woman103_0881,someone who live and he I think he's
Man081_Woman103_0882,straight I mean we never talked about
Man081_Woman103_0883,that but I mean we talk about my
Man081_Woman103_0884,sexuality and he was super gentle and
Man081_Woman103_0885,encouraging and and I was like crying
Man081_Woman103_0886,and his office and he was just like he's
Man081_Woman103_0887,like Oh Joshua you know there have been
Man081_Woman103_0888,so many so many saints that like have
Man081_Woman103_0889,served God you know with the same
Man081_Woman103_0890,feelings that you do and you have a
Man081_Woman103_0891,vocation so I think for him like he was
Man081_Woman103_0892,really great and I mean the guys that I
Man081_Woman103_0893,lived with they were they were awesome
Man081_Woman103_0894,some of them drove me crazy but but most
Man081_Woman103_0895,of them were like your hate right like
Man081_Woman103_0896,Stefan he was this Austrian guy who
Man081_Woman103_0897,would like had one arm and he like he
Man081_Woman103_0898,had Hugh dogs like joke with his
Man081_Woman103_0899,prosthetic arm like you drop's like what
Man081_Woman103_0900,did you do to me you know I'm like there
Man081_Woman103_0901,you go who's from Argentina he was a
Man081_Woman103_0902,lawyer and then he like like I don't
Man081_Woman103_0903,know I want to become a mystic like de
Man081_Woman103_0904,France and like yeah but he would drink
Man081_Woman103_0905,this like highly caffeinated like
Man081_Woman103_0906,tobacco tea called Matta and like drink
Man081_Woman103_0907,it together you do not need caffeine I
Man081_Woman103_0908,can't even imagine that
Man081_Woman103_0909,so you I'd say those are some wood
Man081_Woman103_0910,pull that like that the most of you cool
Man081_Woman103_0911,good answer
Man081_Woman103_0912,when do you feel that I judge you and
Man081_Woman103_0913,why do you think that I do I don't know
Man081_Woman103_0914,if judge me I think to me judge is like
Man081_Woman103_0915,a the wrong word to use like for you
Man081_Woman103_0916,because it comes with a very like
Man081_Woman103_0917,arrogant and like condescending tone and
Man081_Woman103_0918,I don't ever feel that from you but I
Man081_Woman103_0919,think maybe in I'm very aware of you and
Man081_Woman103_0920,what you're thinking about me in
Man081_Woman103_0921,meetings if I'm like speaking without
Man081_Woman103_0922,grace or like off-the-cuff or like in a
Man081_Woman103_0923,way that's not necessarily understanding
Man081_Woman103_0924,or helpful like I'm all very aware of
Man081_Woman103_0925,you in those moments and I just can't
Man081_Woman103_0926,stop it from happening sometimes it just
Man081_Woman103_0927,keeps coming out of my mouth and I'm
Man081_Woman103_0928,just like stop stop so those moments so
Man081_Woman103_0929,Joshua use nice words yeah and I mean I
Man081_Woman103_0930,know like the whole relationship thing
Man081_Woman103_0931,like you disagree with me but I don't
Man081_Woman103_0932,feel judgment necessarily yeah you know
Man081_Woman103_0933,I'm glad because I don't yeah like I
Man081_Woman103_0934,don't feel judgment about me or about me
Man081_Woman103_0935,and Morgan or anything like that
Man081_Woman103_0936,I really think you're in my head more
Man081_Woman103_0937,we're partners now
Man081_Woman103_0938,I know but you're still in my head when
Man081_Woman103_0939,do you think you're betraying your faith
Man081_Woman103_0940,maybe at what moments do you think
Man081_Woman103_0941,you're betraying a fee hmm I think I get
Man081_Woman103_0942,moments of sexual fantasy probably not
Man081_Woman103_0943,primarily because of the you know the
Man081_Woman103_0944,gender of the person the way that it
Man081_Woman103_0945,fits it's more that like that I'm you
Man081_Woman103_0946,know imagining interactions with people
Man081_Woman103_0947,some of them not even covenant with
Man081_Woman103_0948,mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_0949,and I'd say within our community there's
Man081_Woman103_0950,just a couple people that annoy the piss
Man081_Woman103_0951,out of me and I I actually said an
Man081_Woman103_0952,apology last night just like no I feel
Man081_Woman103_0953,like I cooked team I was really rude to
Man081_Woman103_0954,you I was really short I didn't tell
Man081_Woman103_0955,this person that I was just super
Man081_Woman103_0956,annoyed with everything that they did
Man081_Woman103_0957,now they kept running into me and asking

Man081_Woman103_0976,called to that I've never felt called to
Man081_Woman103_0977,that like and it's part of it it's just
Man081_Woman103_0978,part of its that and part of it is just
Man081_Woman103_0979,the way that my life has gone like my
Man081_Woman103_0980,journey with God has led me here you
Man081_Woman103_0981,know and like coming trying to come to

Man081_Woman103_1014,don't want to claim that I understand I

Man081_Woman103_1034,sexuality I know okay I don't know I
Man081_Woman103_1035,mean there are days where I I mean and
Man081_Woman103_1036,it's oddly enough like Film Festival
Man081_Woman103_1037,like global ground causes me much a
Man081_Woman103_1038,guinea really yes it's it causes me it's
Man081_Woman103_1039,always the most stressful time for me
Man081_Woman103_1040,yeah like I sexuality yep oh my god oh
Man081_Woman103_1041,my god I'm doing it wrong I'm doing it
Man081_Woman103_1042,wrong I'm doing this is bad I've made a
Man081_Woman103_1043,bad choice what am i doing I know no I

Man081_Woman103_1047,like I don't know I
Man081_Woman103_1048,that's lessening as I go as I move on in
Man081_Woman103_1049,my life from like that year you
Man081_Woman103_1050,mentioned I mean yeah that was like one
Man081_Woman103_1051,of the worst years of my life hands down
Man081_Woman103_1052,I you know cuz getting distance from
Man081_Woman103_1053,something you can kind of see it more
Man081_Woman103_1054,clearly and understand my own cuz first
Man081_Woman103_1055,for that whole year I couldn't even
Man081_Woman103_1056,articulate what I was feeling you know I
Man081_Woman103_1057,couldn't even say out loud like what you
Man081_Woman103_1058,know people will say like what's
Man081_Woman103_1059,happened what's going on I'm like I was
Man081_Woman103_1060,one of those people I know and I
Man081_Woman103_1061,literally I can't I cannot literally I
Man081_Woman103_1062,can't verbalize it because I don't know
Man081_Woman103_1063,I don't know if that's like a me thing
Man081_Woman103_1064,like I take a lot of time to process
Man081_Woman103_1065,even very small things and just daily
Man081_Woman103_1066,things like the thing we talked around
Man081_Woman103_1067,the car about like Hannibal people
Man081_Woman103_1068,versus people people like that but you
Man081_Woman103_1069,know like that situation I it's been a
Man081_Woman103_1070,like a week or so yeah of me processing
Man081_Woman103_1071,through how I feel about it and what
Man081_Woman103_1072,what am I actually feeling so like
Man081_Woman103_1073,through why have I chosen to be gay I
Man081_Woman103_1074,don't who knows I'll probably understand
Man081_Woman103_1075,in ten years but I think the thing
Man081_Woman103_1076,concrete thing I've come to now is like
Man081_Woman103_1077,I have never I've never let go of God
Man081_Woman103_1078,and I've never let go of my faith and I
Man081_Woman103_1079,really like there were some very
Man081_Woman103_1080,concrete moments that summer that I
Man081_Woman103_1081,decided to like not move to Texas to
Man081_Woman103_1082,stay in California and essentially that
Man081_Woman103_1083,was my decision like if I had to make a
Man081_Woman103_1084,hard and fast decision as to whether be
Man081_Woman103_1085,celibate or like dating people that
Man081_Woman103_1086,would have been it like but yeah so at
Man081_Woman103_1087,the before before that moment like they
Man081_Woman103_1088,were very like I had very specific and
Man081_Woman103_1089,meaningful experiences with God and that
Man081_Woman103_1090,kind of like pushed me in that direction
Man081_Woman103_1091,and like I don't know it was weird stuff
Man081_Woman103_1092,like hope for the future kind of things
Man081_Woman103_1093,like like just little things like I was
Man081_Woman103_1094,so I was just I don't know I was
Man081_Woman103_1095,happening inside of me that summer like
Man081_Woman103_1096,thinking about my future and life and
Man081_Woman103_1097,God and just things like it's really
Man081_Woman103_1098,really dark right now but there's light
Man081_Woman103_1099,up ahead like I remember like feeling
Man081_Woman103_1100,that like those words and how can I
Man081_Woman103_1101,ignore like the process I guess like how
Man081_Woman103_1102,can I say
Man081_Woman103_1103,like I've I'm pursuing you God like I
Man081_Woman103_1104,want you and like this is the process
Man081_Woman103_1105,and this is the the way it's gone I
Man081_Woman103_1106,guess like I don't know that's the best
Man081_Woman103_1107,answer I have and like I mean I think I
Man081_Woman103_1108,don't think this can be an answer but
Man081_Woman103_1109,then like Morgan just makes me so happy
Man081_Woman103_1110,you know and I'm like but then that's
Man081_Woman103_1111,just I know that's just like the shallow
Man081_Woman103_1112,like but love you know but it makes a
Man081_Woman103_1113,central level it means a lot
Man081_Woman103_1114,yeah so I can't yeah I mean happy
Man081_Woman103_1115,really love her so like she calm those
Man081_Woman103_1116,doubts of like I've made a bad decision
Man081_Woman103_1117,I'm screwing up my life kind of thing so
Man081_Woman103_1118,yeah I'm you know all of those things
Man081_Woman103_1119,are true okay do you secretly hope that
Man081_Woman103_1120,I will revert to God's chosen path that
Man081_Woman103_1121,is a loaded question I don't want to
Man081_Woman103_1122,answer this one come on yeah so they're
Man081_Woman103_1123,assuming that you know what God's chosen
Man081_Woman103_1124,path is yeah big big bridges over your
Man081_Woman103_1125,nose so I'll say both do you think that
Man081_Woman103_1126,that's I mean maybe that's what they're
Man081_Woman103_1127,getting at oh do you know what God's
Man081_Woman103_1128,chosen Palace Rhea both reframe the
Man081_Woman103_1129,question and also make it not secret I
Man081_Woman103_1130,mean I I think I can't even believe this
Man081_Woman103_1131,I don't think I know what God's chosen
Man081_Woman103_1132,path for you is you know do I secretly
Man081_Woman103_1133,hope that you'll you know change your
Man081_Woman103_1134,mind back I cut I mean it's
Man081_Woman103_1135,I guess and no because I've I feel like
Man081_Woman103_1136,I don't know when I I feel like I was
Man081_Woman103_1137,hoping and that I don't think I was
Man081_Woman103_1138,super secret about it but I didn't we
Man081_Woman103_1139,just didn't talk about it you just
Man081_Woman103_1140,assumed like I was hoping you would you
Man081_Woman103_1141,would choose you know the same secreto
Man081_Woman103_1142,think that I've got um but then when you
Man081_Woman103_1143,didn't I kind of assumed like this is it
Man081_Woman103_1144,like that like your whole life had led
Man081_Woman103_1145,up to this point I'm like even though I
Man081_Woman103_1146,maybe could not have articulated it the
Man081_Woman103_1147,way that you just did you know you're
Man081_Woman103_1148,like when I chose not to move back to
Man081_Woman103_1149,Texas
Man081_Woman103_1150,mm-hmm like that was the choice and I
Man081_Woman103_1151,think like deep down I got that mm-hmm
Man081_Woman103_1152,and I think my my bigger hope has been
Man081_Woman103_1153,like that you won't because what I've
Man081_Woman103_1154,seen some people do is like when when
Man081_Woman103_1155,they like come out and like they find
Man081_Woman103_1156,like a different way of integrating
Man081_Woman103_1157,their faith in sexuality like then they
Man081_Woman103_1158,turn on the people in the past that have
Man081_Woman103_1159,like said something different and like
Man081_Woman103_1160,like it the the push the blow back of a
Man081_Woman103_1161,reaction is is really fierce and so like
Man081_Woman103_1162,my hope was a it's like Kristin you know
Man081_Woman103_1163,don't forget about you know the rest of
Man081_Woman103_1164,us like yeah yeah and so I think and I
Man081_Woman103_1165,think you've been fair on that it's hard
Man081_Woman103_1166,for me to even it like answer that
Man081_Woman103_1167,question like do I what I hope that you
Man081_Woman103_1168,know that you and and more because I'm I
Man081_Woman103_1169,love your relationship I'm kind I've
Man081_Woman103_1170,heard of other relationships where like
Man081_Woman103_1171,a deeply committed couple you know like
Man081_Woman103_1172,still lives together just you know chase
Man081_Woman103_1173,Li mm-hmm know that I honestly I haven't
Man081_Woman103_1174,I haven't thought through like what my
Man081_Woman103_1175,hopes were
Man081_Woman103_1176,your life would be like and I kind of
Man081_Woman103_1177,had just assumed like you know you've
Man081_Woman103_1178,made the choice you've made so we could
Man081_Woman103_1179,talk about that more but that's I think
Man081_Woman103_1180,that's all I have to say right now I
Man081_Woman103_1181,don't think sighs I know you're your
Man081_Woman103_1182,chosen path or God's chosen path for you
Man081_Woman103_1183,it's definitely a loaded question all
Man081_Woman103_1184,right
Man081_Woman103_1185,hmm so we have loaded questions what
Man081_Woman103_1186,would you change about your relationship
Man081_Woman103_1187,with your family jeez my immediate
Man081_Woman103_1188,family does not talk about anything as
Man081_Woman103_1189,you know so like anything important much
Man081_Woman103_1190,less my sexuality yeah or me in general
Man081_Woman103_1191,but you know so yeah it would be nice to
Man081_Woman103_1192,feel like an actual part of my family
Man081_Woman103_1193,because I feel like not a part of my
Man081_Woman103_1194,family especially now I feel like
Man081_Woman103_1195,they're distancing themselves even
Man081_Woman103_1196,further but what am I gonna do so yeah I

Man081_Woman103_1234,being generous so I'm never gonna tell
Man081_Woman103_1235,you no but since that's the one thing

Man081_Woman103_1237,just bring a six-pack every once in a
Man081_Woman103_1238,while well I know it's hard because I
Man081_Woman103_1239,drink a lot of beers so you just don't

Man081_Woman103_1241,six-pack
Man081_Woman103_1242,yeah that's probably a butter got any

Man081_Woman103_1244,receiving hospital receiving yeah you're
Man081_Woman103_1245,also you're very good at that was not
Man081_Woman103_1246,meant to be a critique on your all of
Man081_Woman103_1247,your hospitality abilities yeah just the
Man081_Woman103_1248,beer drinking someone that's been a
Man081_Woman103_1249,financial thing - yeah but absolutely

Man081_Woman103_1251,you find a way - yeah well yeah maybe
Man081_Woman103_1252,that's a critique on me I should stop
Man081_Woman103_1253,buying beer
