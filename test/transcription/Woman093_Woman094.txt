Woman093_Woman094_0032,plan originally so so do you want to
Woman093_Woman094_0033,move to that question for me yeah
Woman093_Woman094_0034,favorite childhood memory favorite
Woman093_Woman094_0035,childhood memory is growing up in France
Woman093_Woman094_0036,and in the summer we would go to the to
Woman093_Woman094_0037,Brittany to spend the summer holidays in
Woman093_Woman094_0038,the farm to some old and uncle and so we
Woman093_Woman094_0039,would wake up very early usually like
Woman093_Woman094_0040,5:30 6 o'clock and go to the stables
Woman093_Woman094_0041,because they were milking the cows so
Woman093_Woman094_0042,with my sister we would just wake up
Woman093_Woman094_0043,super early run through the field of the
Woman093_Woman094_0044,farm and go in the stable and it was
Woman093_Woman094_0045,like smelling like
Woman093_Woman094_0046,and we would love that like just trying
Woman093_Woman094_0047,to help with milking the cars and then
Woman093_Woman094_0048,once this was done we would go to the
Woman093_Woman094_0049,big kitchen area to have breakfast and
Woman093_Woman094_0050,my old aunt she was making a distorted
Woman093_Woman094_0051,bread like old country bread bit bread
Woman093_Woman094_0052,like this country style and she was

Woman093_Woman094_0060,relationship is a difficult one I didn't
Woman093_Woman094_0061,know but it's difficult
Woman093_Woman094_0062,I knew we loved each other so much but I
Woman093_Woman094_0063,know we also rub each other the wrong
Woman093_Woman094_0064,way a lot both ways but I think what's
Woman093_Woman094_0065,very special is at the end of the day we
Woman093_Woman094_0066,both have a lot of love and good
Woman093_Woman094_0067,intentions you know so even when we
Woman093_Woman094_0068,sometimes like get mad at each other we
Woman093_Woman094_0069,know it's just temporary and two hours
Woman093_Woman094_0070,later or the next day we're back on and
Woman093_Woman094_0071,it's kind of us again you know so we're
Woman093_Woman094_0072,just able to always forget and forgive

Woman093_Woman094_0109,people and you can just take the plane

Woman093_Woman094_0136,the most
Woman093_Woman094_0137,or what did you like doing them was not
Woman093_Woman094_0138,mm I think so 9 years old I spend a lot
Woman093_Woman094_0139,of time rollerskating the one with the
Woman093_Woman094_0140,four wheels so you know I don't you
Woman093_Woman094_0141,remember the house which would you where
Woman093_Woman094_0142,we used to live with that little dead an
Woman093_Woman094_0143,area so we have the whole street to
Woman093_Woman094_0144,ourselves
Woman093_Woman094_0145,so we would just do like a lot of
Woman093_Woman094_0146,rollerskating we would make like little
Woman093_Woman094_0147,choreography dancing with the
Woman093_Woman094_0148,rollerskating and just spend hours doing
Woman093_Woman094_0149,that I think actually we had we had a
Woman093_Woman094_0150,group of three lovers like me and in
Woman093_Woman094_0151,this class
Woman093_Woman094_0152,we had three of the same name and we are
Woman093_Woman094_0153,very friendly the three of us so it was
Woman093_Woman094_0154,Louis and the other two loans not very I
Woman093_Woman094_0155,mean Louis for yellow ones below Hostin
Woman093_Woman094_0156,color here we go
Woman093_Woman094_0157,what scares you the most and cares you
Woman093_Woman094_0158,know what like like I don't know like
Woman093_Woman094_0159,really scared play yeah like what do you
Woman093_Woman094_0160,find scary nothing she's scared oh no I
Woman093_Woman094_0161,[Laughter]
Woman093_Woman094_0162,don't know so think about after okay
Woman093_Woman094_0163,when you were my age wet scared even
Woman093_Woman094_0164,last I always I had a big fear that the
Woman093_Woman094_0165,house would get robbed
Woman093_Woman094_0166,so I remember some time waking up in the
Woman093_Woman094_0167,middle of the night and because we were
Woman093_Woman094_0168,living in the countryside they were all
Woman093_Woman094_0169,these noises mostly from animals and I
Woman093_Woman094_0170,always had this fear that maybe was
Woman093_Woman094_0171,people coming in and rubbing their eyes
Woman093_Woman094_0172,and so being robbed I think also you
Woman093_Woman094_0173,know what because I remember going to my
Woman093_Woman094_0174,grandparents house arriving one day
Woman093_Woman094_0175,opening the door and they had just been
Woman093_Woman094_0176,robbed but they had left already but the
Woman093_Woman094_0177,house was upside down and he was like we
Woman093_Woman094_0178,were you with your parents yes with my
Woman093_Woman094_0179,parents we arrived at the house we had
Woman093_Woman094_0180,the key we opened and we realized the
Woman093_Woman094_0181,house had been robbed upside down and so
Woman093_Woman094_0182,then I kept thinking it could happen to
Woman093_Woman094_0183,us too and while we're there and
Woman093_Woman094_0184,sleeping so and in the countryside you
Woman093_Woman094_0185,know like it doesn't happen here in the
Woman093_Woman094_0186,city but in the middle of the night
Woman093_Woman094_0187,there's really like nobody nothing so I
Woman093_Woman094_0188,always feel like it could be people okay
Woman093_Woman094_0189,so what scares you the most
Woman093_Woman094_0190,it's when you since you told me that
Woman093_Woman094_0191,cowboy day men were robbed I was in the
Woman093_Woman094_0192,middle of the night and um I'd yet that
Woman093_Woman094_0193,her friend were awake yes that's when it
Woman093_Woman094_0194,scared me than with ah do you think it
Woman093_Woman094_0195,back about that sometime and also like
Woman093_Woman094_0196,when I came back from hip-hop alone but
Woman093_Woman094_0197,it was more like the winter and it was
Woman093_Woman094_0198,like dark I was kind of scared like when
Woman093_Woman094_0199,I saw people that so you answer that so
Woman093_Woman094_0200,it's you now I guess do you think
Woman093_Woman094_0201,that'll be a good mother why of course I
Woman093_Woman094_0202,can you'll be a good mother I think
Woman093_Woman094_0203,you'll be
Woman093_Woman094_0204,because you you have a little bit like
Woman093_Woman094_0205,even that teacher like personality you
Woman093_Woman094_0206,know that you you're strict and you were
Woman093_Woman094_0207,very good at directing people and at
Woman093_Woman094_0208,being in charge so and also you take no
Woman093_Woman094_0209,from anybody so I think your kids are
Woman093_Woman094_0210,going to be like you don't let people
Woman093_Woman094_0211,step on your toes let's say so I think
Woman093_Woman094_0212,you're probably gonna be but at the same
Woman093_Woman094_0213,I mean but at the same time you can be a
Woman093_Woman094_0214,lot of fun and you so I think it's gonna
Woman093_Woman094_0215,be a good combination
Woman093_Woman094_0216,you're gonna be a very good no question
Woman093_Woman094_0217,the one that was a question y'all ready
Woman093_Woman094_0218,okay so what do you want to be when you
Woman093_Woman094_0219,it's nothing what do you want to be when
Woman093_Woman094_0220,you grow up I don't know hip-hop dancer
Woman093_Woman094_0221,what's the hardest thing about being a
Woman093_Woman094_0222,mom what's the hardest many things it's
Woman093_Woman094_0223,very hard to be a mom I think to just
Woman093_Woman094_0224,adapt to to adapt to your child's
Woman093_Woman094_0225,personality because some things work
Woman093_Woman094_0226,with one kid and doesn't work with the
Woman093_Woman094_0227,other kid so you just have to be
Woman093_Woman094_0228,flexible you know and you know you you
Woman093_Woman094_0229,want to of course you want the best and
Woman093_Woman094_0230,there are certain things that are not
Woman093_Woman094_0231,really negotiable like you want your
Woman093_Woman094_0232,child you know to eat well and sleep
Woman093_Woman094_0233,well do well at school and learn a lot
Woman093_Woman094_0234,and and be happy and be a social person
Woman093_Woman094_0235,so it's just being balanced and you
Woman093_Woman094_0236,still want to be a fun person and you
Woman093_Woman094_0237,want to be good friends so just being
Woman093_Woman094_0238,balanced I think from what you said
Woman093_Woman094_0239,about doing well at school do you think
Woman093_Woman094_0240,that has to do with anything at home
Woman093_Woman094_0241,what do you mean like
Woman093_Woman094_0242,poor credit yes if I get good grades it
Woman093_Woman094_0243,battery no I mean there's no report
Woman093_Woman094_0244,cards are to him you would want some
Woman093_Woman094_0245,report card no do you think what my
Woman093_Woman094_0246,report grad school has to do with what I
Woman093_Woman094_0247,would what I make at home
Woman093_Woman094_0248,I'm not sure what you're trying to say
Woman093_Woman094_0249,you want to try it in French I'm not
Woman093_Woman094_0250,sure what you are asking it's good just
Woman093_Woman094_0251,click it it'll not I think I said what I
Woman093_Woman094_0252,like no I mean the there's no connection
Woman093_Woman094_0253,it I mean I I just I know you're doing
Woman093_Woman094_0254,very well at school and I want you to do
Woman093_Woman094_0255,very well at home but like it's just a
Woman093_Woman094_0256,different system in a way hello yes
Woman093_Woman094_0257,interesting what term or phrase do I say
Woman093_Woman094_0258,the most you're gonna say it in English
Woman093_Woman094_0259,you don't go brush your teeth three
Woman093_Woman094_0260,times a day I guess or two times a day
Woman093_Woman094_0261,at least
Woman093_Woman094_0262,what are you worried about for me and my
Woman093_Woman094_0263,future I mean I'm not really worried I'm
Woman093_Woman094_0264,pretty optimistic and I think you're
Woman093_Woman094_0265,like a strong person and you're very
Woman093_Woman094_0266,smart and so I'm not really worried now
Woman093_Woman094_0267,this world has gotten a little bit crazy
Woman093_Woman094_0268,scary with lots of people know that
Woman093_Woman094_0269,messing up a little bit this planet and
Woman093_Woman094_0270,are not acting like very nice human
Woman093_Woman094_0271,beings so that's the the part that I
Woman093_Woman094_0272,worried I know you can do very well and
Woman093_Woman094_0273,you have all the tools but it's more the
Woman093_Woman094_0274,people that you might meet or being in
Woman093_Woman094_0275,the wrong place at the wrong time so
Woman093_Woman094_0276,this is a little bit friend wearisome
Woman093_Woman094_0277,anything so well yes of course I mean I
Woman093_Woman094_0278,worry that you meet the wrong friends
Woman093_Woman094_0279,that's never that's a tricky situation
Woman093_Woman094_0280,where especially when you in the
Woman093_Woman094_0281,teenager years or because of course your
Woman093_Woman094_0282,friends are gonna influence you a lot
Woman093_Woman094_0283,and for work I'm not worried at all
Woman093_Woman094_0284,because you have lots of good ideas and
Woman093_Woman094_0285,I know you're interested in many
Woman093_Woman094_0286,feelings and I think you still have a
Woman093_Woman094_0287,lot of times you think about that anyway
Woman093_Woman094_0288,so
Woman093_Woman094_0289,what's the greatest lesson I taught you
Woman093_Woman094_0290,I do next one
Woman093_Woman094_0291,are you happy you are the oldest child
Woman093_Woman094_0292,why or why not yes because I can pass me
Woman093_Woman094_0293,by there how am I most like you and how
Woman093_Woman094_0294,does that scare you actually don't think
Woman093_Woman094_0295,you're like me a toll on you really
Woman093_Woman094_0296,you've got to Teddy's side yeah I don't
Woman093_Woman094_0297,recognize myself in you so I guess I
Woman093_Woman094_0298,just keep that one what have I done
Woman093_Woman094_0299,or what happened to me that scared you
Woman093_Woman094_0300,the most why exactly too many accidents
Woman093_Woman094_0301,opening your the I guess the first time
Woman093_Woman094_0302,you open your forehead that was very
Woman093_Woman094_0303,scary because it was the first time I
Woman093_Woman094_0304,had to deal with a big was it
Woman093_Woman094_0305,armed the first time okay so that was
Woman093_Woman094_0306,the when you broke your arm so very
Woman093_Woman094_0307,scary because I had never dealt with
Woman093_Woman094_0308,such a real person being in such pain
Woman093_Woman094_0309,and emergency room and you just of
Woman093_Woman094_0310,course you think about the worst and you
Woman093_Woman094_0311,it's very hard to keep like super calm
Woman093_Woman094_0312,and not worry too much and thankfully
Woman093_Woman094_0313,and also because i don't like the sight
Woman093_Woman094_0314,of blood to start with and so it was
Woman093_Woman094_0315,making me like really uncomfortable
Woman093_Woman094_0316,oh and i remember when we did the
Woman093_Woman094_0317,surgery first
Woman093_Woman094_0318,and second time and I couldn't watch the
Woman093_Woman094_0319,surgeon doing it so I was like put in
Woman093_Woman094_0320,your hands and being there for you but
Woman093_Woman094_0321,at the same time I just was trying to
Woman093_Woman094_0322,not faint myself so that's I guess I
Woman093_Woman094_0323,will do better now that I've done it a
Woman093_Woman094_0324,couple of times with you and your
