Man075_Man076_0001,you remember about the first time we met

Man075_Man076_0008,did I say pretending being asleep and
Man075_Man076_0009,and just kind of playing a joke on you

Man075_Man076_0036,their wedding and weddings are magical
Man075_Man076_0037,and you know that's a really wonderful
Man075_Man076_0038,memory mm-hmm and mornings in your mom's
Man075_Man076_0039,kitchen
Man075_Man076_0040,[Music]
Man075_Man076_0041,mmm when do you feel closest to me when
Man075_Man076_0042,do mm-hmm
Man075_Man076_0043,when do you feel closest to me
Man075_Man076_0044,when we're cooking mmm and the mornings
Man075_Man076_0045,mornings are really if we're up together
Man075_Man076_0046,words it up at the same time which is
Man075_Man076_0047,not often what are you hesitant to tell
Man075_Man076_0048,me
Man075_Man076_0049,I think although are enough I think my
Man075_Man076_0050,biggest challenge is always I guess I'm
Man075_Man076_0051,taking a different route but when I'm
Man075_Man076_0052,not sure if my words are going are going
Man075_Man076_0053,to cost you anxiety or or or there's
Man075_Man076_0054,gonna create tension so I'm always
Man075_Man076_0055,hesitant to share to be honest in about
Man075_Man076_0056,a certain thing or about a certain
Man075_Man076_0057,feeling that I have
Man075_Man076_0058,so that us do not create friction so
Man075_Man076_0059,that's not a subject but is it more
Man075_Man076_0060,situation what's the greatest lesson I
Man075_Man076_0061,taught you
Man075_Man076_0062,there are a lot maybe grace forgiveness
Man075_Man076_0063,with kind of all my baggage I think
Man075_Man076_0064,you're sort of still teaching me even
Man075_Man076_0065,though maybe that's not your intention
Man075_Man076_0066,you have forgiveness and grace with just
Man075_Man076_0067,all the stuff in the world you know and
Man075_Man076_0068,and and not just the act of forgiving
Man075_Man076_0069,but the process of forgiving so when we
Man075_Man076_0070,were going to the lake the other day and
Man075_Man076_0071,that lady pissed me off because she
Man075_Man076_0072,asked for the new sticker and I
Man075_Man076_0073,appreciate that you're learning how to
Man075_Man076_0074,communicate that to me in a way that I'm
Man075_Man076_0075,hearing it better about like just you
Man075_Man076_0076,are teaching me to like it's not really
Man075_Man076_0077,her fault you know so no it's my time oh
Man075_Man076_0078,how is money a conflict in our
Man075_Man076_0079,relationship OhLaLa I have as you know
Man075_Man076_0080,I've always struggled with the with this
Man075_Man076_0081,idea of making money which is no longer
Man075_Man076_0082,a struggle by the way just a tool to
Man075_Man076_0083,understand my relationship with money
Man075_Man076_0084,and not given that importance that much
Man075_Man076_0085,importance in my life although I
Man075_Man076_0086,understand how how necessary it is I
Man075_Man076_0087,think that the biggest challenge has
Man075_Man076_0088,been in relationship you know being
Man075_Man076_0089,alone it's okay but in relationship
Man075_Man076_0090,it gets so tied into the idea of
Man075_Man076_0091,self-worth and providing that
Man075_Man076_0092,yes this challenge what is the question
Man075_Man076_0093,again I got lost into it okay how is
Man075_Man076_0094,money a conflict in our relationship
Man075_Man076_0095,yeah so III think that also you have
Man075_Man076_0096,been the primary primary provider
Man075_Man076_0097,financially and so III think that that
Man075_Man076_0098,causes I think both internal friction
Man075_Man076_0099,and friction here not knowing if your
Man075_Man076_0100,value of me is also tied to that or
Man075_Man076_0101,knowing that it's not but at the same
Man075_Man076_0102,time knowing how important money is to
Man075_Man076_0103,you and secure financial security so
Man075_Man076_0104,it's that friction between um being
Man075_Man076_0105,self-sufficient being responsible and on
Man075_Man076_0106,the other hand the the certain
Man075_Man076_0107,detachment I have to it so that's that's
Man075_Man076_0108,a really interesting internal dialogue
Man075_Man076_0109,as well as well as here am I the best
Man075_Man076_0110,sex you ever had
Man075_Man076_0111,easy easy
Man075_Man076_0112,I don't think you believe me oh I
Man075_Man076_0113,believe you okay we've talked about that
Man075_Man076_0114,before
Man075_Man076_0115,[Music]
Man075_Man076_0116,what do you wish you could there's two
Man075_Man076_0117,questions mm-hmm what do you wish you
Man075_Man076_0118,could heal in me / what pain would you
Man075_Man076_0119,take away hmm
Man075_Man076_0120,so what do you wish you could heal in me
Man075_Man076_0121,what pain would you take away
Man075_Man076_0122,I think to heal in you although although
Man075_Man076_0123,I know that I have I don't have that
Man075_Man076_0124,power but I think that I can assist in
Man075_Man076_0125,the process would be which which is
Man075_Man076_0126,often as a source of conflict in us is
Man075_Man076_0127,this idea of of of support that that to
Man075_Man076_0128,be supported and and to let me support
Man075_Man076_0129,you or let other people support you
Man075_Man076_0130,without feeling criticized and I see
Man075_Man076_0131,that pattern with other people I think
Man075_Man076_0132,that are close to you without feeling a
Man075_Man076_0133,sense of being controlled by the
Man075_Man076_0134,contributions that other want to do in
Man075_Man076_0135,your life so it's been a fine thing
Man075_Man076_0136,between between you know learning to
Man075_Man076_0137,support you in the way that you need to
Man075_Man076_0138,be supported and the second heal and
Man075_Man076_0139,take away pain ain't a little early I
Man075_Man076_0140,think the pain that the church has cost
Man075_Man076_0141,you it's such a huge source of
Man075_Man076_0142,discomfort for you whatever that means
Man075_Man076_0143,I mean institution what what but what
Man075_Man076_0144,what by church I mean what institutions
Man075_Man076_0145,have done to you or have have not done
Man075_Man076_0146,to you that I didn't want to say that I
Man075_Man076_0147,don't feel that does that's that's not
Man075_Man076_0148,what I want to say just I wish I could
Man075_Man076_0149,take away the pain of your journey with
Man075_Man076_0150,the church
Man075_Man076_0151,do you wish I make more money me too
Man075_Man076_0152,I wish you know we talked about this
Man075_Man076_0153,before I didn't sign up to be the
Man075_Man076_0154,breadwinner I'm like I'm not the person
Man075_Man076_0155,either that wants to just be taken care
Man075_Man076_0156,of I mean you know me I'm all about
Man075_Man076_0157,balance in equality so like I don't like
Man075_Man076_0158,paying the bills yeah I don't like it
Man075_Man076_0159,yeah and I know that yes that's why
Man075_Man076_0160,we're what can I change about this
Man075_Man076_0161,do you regret committing to me what i
Man075_Man076_0162,mean by that is with all my family's
Man075_Man076_0163,quirks and and now that you know me like
Man075_Man076_0164,it's multi-leveled you know so now that
Man075_Man076_0165,you know me well and profoundly mm-hmm
Man075_Man076_0166,you know and part of you know like some
Man075_Man076_0167,of my insecurities and stuff do you
Man075_Man076_0168,regret committing to me mm-hmm not a
Man075_Man076_0169,single second no I'm gonna expand on
Man075_Man076_0170,that I think part of me mourns as you
Man075_Man076_0171,know we always talk about this idea of
Man075_Man076_0172,being monogamous while at the same time
Man075_Man076_0173,being polyamorous so I'll be honest with
Man075_Man076_0174,you part of me mourns in his soft choice
Man075_Man076_0175,because I said person that functions
Man075_Man076_0176,best in a monogamous relationship I
Man075_Man076_0177,still mourn this idea of experience in
Man075_Man076_0178,other people of of actuate in love with
Man075_Man076_0179,other people so that's just a little
Man075_Man076_0180,warm but however my commitment to you
Man075_Man076_0181,our commitment never never it's it's is
Man075_Man076_0182,such a gift and it was so easy to say
Man075_Man076_0183,yes to this commitment I mean from the
Man075_Man076_0184,very
Man075_Man076_0185,first time and I mean there is not a day
Man075_Man076_0186,that I'm not grateful for our journey
Man075_Man076_0187,together do you have a fantasy that
Man075_Man076_0188,you're afraid to share with me I know
Man075_Man076_0189,that question came up in the film thing
Man075_Man076_0190,hmm you know the first night I don't
Man075_Man076_0191,have a fantasy I'm afraid of a sexual
Man075_Man076_0192,fantasy mm-hmm so is that what no it's
Man075_Man076_0193,just a fantasy it's open just a fantasy
Man075_Man076_0194,in general like something that you found
Man075_Man076_0195,fantasize about and yet you're afraid to
Man075_Man076_0196,share with me because X Y or Z I mean
Man075_Man076_0197,sometimes I fantasize yeah about it
Man075_Man076_0198,comes back to the money thing like you
Man075_Man076_0199,know I would love it if you'd get a
Man075_Man076_0200,teaching position and because I think
Man075_Man076_0201,that academic life would be fun mm-hmm
Man075_Man076_0202,and interesting so I fantasize about
Man075_Man076_0203,that mmm and then but I don't think I'm
Man075_Man076_0204,afraid to share it with you only only
Man075_Man076_0205,that I know that you don't want that and
Man075_Man076_0206,so I I just I don't so there's no fear I
Man075_Man076_0207,sometimes fantasize that we have kids
Man075_Man076_0208,mm-hmm and I'm not afraid about that but
Man075_Man076_0209,I might have some more sadness about it
Man075_Man076_0210,because it I I have the opinion that
Man075_Man076_0211,it's too late because I'm in my 50s and
Man075_Man076_0212,you're about to be in your 50s and I
Man075_Man076_0213,just think that that's not responsible
Man075_Man076_0214,and so I I don't know I don't really
Man075_Man076_0215,have
Man075_Man076_0216,I'm afraid to tell you about mm-hmm so
Man075_Man076_0217,we explore a little bit that because you
Man075_Man076_0218,said you know I know that you don't want
Man075_Man076_0219,to teach but that's not true
Man075_Man076_0220,necessarily you know that there is
Man075_Man076_0221,conflict there's internal comfort
Man075_Man076_0222,because I do want to teach you however I
Man075_Man076_0223,want to teach on my terms
Man075_Man076_0224,ya know you know and so they you know
Man075_Man076_0225,what I mean no I do it I should I should
Man075_Man076_0226,have made myself more clear like I think
Man075_Man076_0227,I think it'd be fun if you taught in a
Man075_Man076_0228,university setting you know because I
Man075_Man076_0229,think that cultures fun academia you
Man075_Man076_0230,know I romanticized that I think I'm
Man075_Man076_0231,finding out that I mean maybe I'm drawn
Man075_Man076_0232,to that and that's probably what I
Man075_Man076_0233,should have done you know like I should
Man075_Man076_0234,have studied sociology and got a PhD and
Man075_Man076_0235,become a sociology professor and some I
Man075_Man076_0236,think I'm transferring on you you know
Man075_Man076_0237,because you're like I'm sad I can't
Man075_Man076_0238,really make changes I mean I can but so
Man075_Man076_0239,that's what I mean academically on the
Man075_Man076_0240,university level so I know that you want
Man075_Man076_0241,to that you want to teach on your terms
Man075_Man076_0242,yes mantra is what could I do to improve
Man075_Man076_0243,our relationship
Man075_Man076_0244,I think but I believe that accepting
Man075_Man076_0245,yourself that's who you are and trusting
Man075_Man076_0246,that I already do you know I know that
Man075_Man076_0247,you're at times self-conscious about how
Man075_Man076_0248,you look and so I I think if if you let
Man075_Man076_0249,go a little bit of that self-criticism
Man075_Man076_0250,and know that it's not coming from the
Man075_Man076_0251,other side for me and and and just
Man075_Man076_0252,letting me love you for who you are what
Man075_Man076_0253,you are you know regardless of what you
Man075_Man076_0254,look regardless of this regardless of
Man075_Man076_0255,that I think that that would just open
Man075_Man076_0256,up another aspect of our relationship
Man075_Man076_0257,and I think that we have been there
Man075_Man076_0258,maybe I'm not sure but you know that's I
Man075_Man076_0259,think that that would be
Man075_Man076_0260,mmm when do you worry about me
Man075_Man076_0261,and why when do I worry that mean and
Man075_Man076_0262,why
Man075_Man076_0263,I worry that here you don't plan for the
Man075_Man076_0264,future and I'm kind of afraid that
Man075_Man076_0265,that's gonna end our relationship sooner
Man075_Man076_0266,than asked to and so I worry look I
Man075_Man076_0267,really think it's going to be fun to
Man075_Man076_0268,grow old together and so I worry that
Man075_Man076_0269,you're not planning you know you're
Man075_Man076_0270,really healthy you know and I recognize
Man075_Man076_0271,you know that we have different cultures
Man075_Man076_0272,that we come from and I know that I am a
Man075_Man076_0273,product of my society and my culture I
Man075_Man076_0274,know that but at the same time I can't
Man075_Man076_0275,help but worry about your health even
Man075_Man076_0276,though you're healthy mm-hmm you know
Man075_Man076_0277,maybe it's irrational but I do
Man075_Man076_0278,so can we explore that a little bit more
Man075_Man076_0279,so yes so because of the employment I've
Man075_Man076_0280,had and at times haven't had you know
Man075_Man076_0281,working in the studio and blah blah blah
Man075_Man076_0282,we have we have been I have been with
Man075_Man076_0283,our insurance we are fortunate that now
Man075_Man076_0284,through your new employment we I have
Man075_Man076_0285,insurance are you okay with I mean life
Man075_Man076_0286,is so unpredictable mm-hmm you know so
Man075_Man076_0287,really looking at this idea that really
Man075_Man076_0288,there is nothing we can do
Man075_Man076_0289,because even even even people who have
Man075_Man076_0290,all the means in the world are gone you
Man075_Man076_0291,know even without without any control
Man075_Man076_0292,I mean sure they can pay doctors they
Man075_Man076_0293,can do this they can do these procedures
Man075_Man076_0294,and some people are able to survive with
Man075_Man076_0295,that but so so so I hear you are here I
Man075_Man076_0296,hear you're worried and I understand
Man075_Man076_0297,where it comes from at the same time so
Man075_Man076_0298,is that also tied with financial is that
Man075_Man076_0299,financial worry is it might be you know
Man075_Man076_0300,because like I don't know like what
Man075_Man076_0301,would happen if you know we had to have
Man075_Man076_0302,hospice and you know maybe it's because
Man075_Man076_0303,I'm in that industry think about that
Man075_Man076_0304,you know people have to spend a shitload
Man075_Man076_0305,of money all the time for you know some
Man075_Man076_0306,kind of disease and so maybe it is
Man075_Man076_0307,financial just like there's some
Man075_Man076_0308,financial insecurity but it also is kind
Man075_Man076_0309,of tied up and it seems irrational I
Man075_Man076_0310,mean
Man075_Man076_0311,because you're super super healthy and
Man075_Man076_0312,maybe you've since you've already had
Man075_Man076_0313,your brush with death that gives you a
Man075_Man076_0314,pass card or something I don't know but
Man075_Man076_0315,okay so how do you feel about and we
Man075_Man076_0316,have had this conversation so let's say
Man075_Man076_0317,I get sick you know one of the big ones
Man075_Man076_0318,comes along or whatever and I decide you
Man075_Man076_0319,know what we just don't have the money
Man075_Man076_0320,for this I'm just gonna end it how will
Man075_Man076_0321,you feel about that because I've
Man075_Man076_0322,experienced you know I've experienced
Man075_Man076_0323,people know like they've done suicide
Man075_Man076_0324,and so like I don't really have a strong
Man075_Man076_0325,moral issue with that no no that's not
Man075_Man076_0326,your question mm-hmm just I don't know
Man075_Man076_0327,what this I don't know that I would be
Man075_Man076_0328,upset with you know I wouldn't want that
Man075_Man076_0329,I love someone I suspect I would want to
Man075_Man076_0330,take care of you you know we've not been
Man075_Man076_0331,there mm-hmm you know but when you love
Man075_Man076_0332,someone you I mean I've never loved
Man075_Man076_0333,anyone like I love you too sighing I
Man075_Man076_0334,would want to take care of you so it's
Man075_Man076_0335,interesting and I'm being tricky you
Man075_Man076_0336,know where I'm going with this because
Man075_Man076_0337,you often say that if you were in a
Man075_Man076_0338,certain situation you would end your
Man075_Man076_0339,life and so I just want you to reflect
Man075_Man076_0340,on that because the same way that you
Man075_Man076_0341,just said it I also want to be that for
Man075_Man076_0342,you know if whatever situation came
Man075_Man076_0343,along I mean because the insurance is
Man075_Man076_0344,not going to assure anything and you
Man075_Man076_0345,know that or whatever finances it so you
Man075_Man076_0346,often say if I were in that situation I
Man075_Man076_0347,would just end it and you know we go
Man075_Man076_0348,back and forth so I think that this we
Man075_Man076_0349,need to keep this dialogue going okay in
Man075_Man076_0350,terms of because I want the same I want
Man075_Man076_0351,to be able to my
Man075_Man076_0352,meant to you it's my commitment to you
Man075_Man076_0353,and so were you in a situation where you
Man075_Man076_0354,needed care man I want to do that I want
Man075_Man076_0355,to sign up for that yeah but that thing
Man075_Man076_0356,is not dignified either and it's
Man075_Man076_0357,miserable I mean that with that thing
Man075_Man076_0358,you know but you don't even know if
Man075_Man076_0359,that's gonna happen no I don't know
Man075_Man076_0360,exactly
Man075_Man076_0361,so anyway I just go for it
Man075_Man076_0362,Jessica you can ask what do I give you
Man075_Man076_0363,that none of your other partners did
Man075_Man076_0364,well none of you know my other partners
Man075_Man076_0365,or people I dated and gave me the sense
Man075_Man076_0366,of kind of home you know it's just like
Man075_Man076_0367,it's home you're home to me and that was
Man075_Man076_0368,easy you know it's like it was just so
Man075_Man076_0369,easy to you know I mean I I don't know
Man075_Man076_0370,how to explain it it's just like your
Man075_Man076_0371,home so even though there are other
Man075_Man076_0372,people that have also felt that way I
Man075_Man076_0373,obviously have made my commitment to you
Man075_Man076_0374,and so anyway yeah okay
Man075_Man076_0375,are you ever worried I may fall in love
Man075_Man076_0376,with someone else
Man075_Man076_0377,and why yeah
Man075_Man076_0378,that worries me sometimes you know when
Man075_Man076_0379,we have visitors from other countries I
Man075_Man076_0380,it's because my own insecurities I you
Man075_Man076_0381,know one time I don't even remember the
Man075_Man076_0382,context but you know I really appreciate
Man075_Man076_0383,your honest and you really share things
Man075_Man076_0384,but you said you like these guys that
Man075_Man076_0385,were just really thin you know and you
Man075_Man076_0386,like that and I'm not that I know it was
Man075_Man076_0387,just one contacts and it's just my
Man075_Man076_0388,insecurities you know I think like one
Man075_Man076_0389,of your previous relationships could
Man075_Man076_0390,have given you the world as far as an
Man075_Man076_0391,art studio space and another guy is
Man075_Man076_0392,really artistic and I'm not as deeply
Man075_Man076_0393,creative it has some of your previous
Man075_Man076_0394,guys and even sometimes really truly
Man075_Man076_0395,wonder if you could fall in love with a
Man075_Man076_0396,woman and because I know how openly
Man075_Man076_0397,loving you are and I love that about you
Man075_Man076_0398,but I I can't be a woman either
Man075_Man076_0399,and so yeah I sometimes do and I mean
Man075_Man076_0400,it's just all over the board and so I'm
Man075_Man076_0401,sure it's just my insecurities because
Man075_Man076_0402,then you know in a row there are a
Man075_Man076_0403,couple of guys I've told you that you
Man075_Man076_0404,know they're so masculine and I think
Man075_Man076_0405,that you would you know just be really
Man075_Man076_0406,attracted to that more so I think that
Man075_Man076_0407,it's not anything that you've indicated
Man075_Man076_0408,to me I think it's just really and truly
Man075_Man076_0409,my own insecurities know
Man075_Man076_0410,what is interesting about that is that
Man075_Man076_0411,it's not a question of would I fall in
Man075_Man076_0412,love with somebody else
Man075_Man076_0413,because before I came into this
Man075_Man076_0414,relationship I was in love with somebody
Man075_Man076_0415,for him
Man075_Man076_0416,III remember that person I remain in
Man075_Man076_0417,love with several people they're not
Man075_Man076_0418,fall in love with with people I mean you
Man075_Man076_0419,know that so it's not a question of so
Man075_Man076_0420,the that's the healthy at all the fact
Man075_Man076_0421,that you know that I love you're not the
Man075_Man076_0422,only person I love right you know that
Man075_Man076_0423,we know that however however you are the
Man075_Man076_0424,person I love with such a profound I can
Man075_Man076_0425,say you're just home to me so and so
Man075_Man076_0426,maybe that that question is a better
Man075_Man076_0427,question because we know that we talked
Man075_Man076_0428,about that that you're loving so are you
Man075_Man076_0429,you're worried I may fall in love with
Man075_Man076_0430,someone else I guess I'm not worried
Man075_Man076_0431,because I know that you do love other
Man075_Man076_0432,people I'm afraid that you'll leave me
Man075_Man076_0433,or choose them over me okay that's the
Man075_Man076_0434,best okay I'm not afraid you'll choose
Man075_Man076_0435,them over me okay
Man075_Man076_0436,you never know gotta keep it interesting
Man075_Man076_0437,I yeah
Man075_Man076_0438,what changing me could I make to improve
Man075_Man076_0439,my relationship with my mom they're not
Man075_Man076_0440,even charging for this counseling you
Man075_Man076_0441,know just being to your mom who you
Man075_Man076_0442,already are being to mom you know
Man075_Man076_0443,letting go of all the shit's I mean you
Man075_Man076_0444,you always talk about oh don't shoot
Man075_Man076_0445,them people and so if if if you were
Man075_Man076_0446,able to with mom just be with it be with
Man075_Man076_0447,who she is love her the way you love her
Man075_Man076_0448,and and just suspend all the all the
Man075_Man076_0449,shoes or the criticism or the i wish ii
Man075_Man076_0450,this or i wish that you know do you
Man075_Man076_0451,understand what i'm going with this just
Man075_Man076_0452,just just loving mom for who she is
Man075_Man076_0453,except okay grace right what grace we
Man075_Man076_0454,talk about grace
Man075_Man076_0455,so total acceptance so grace is
Man075_Man076_0456,regardless of their circumstances you
Man075_Man076_0457,love your acceptance of this human being
Man075_Man076_0458,is not tied with anything they have done
Man075_Man076_0459,or anything they have failed to do so if
Man075_Man076_0460,somehow you know we could wipe all of
Man075_Man076_0461,that and encounter mom just as the human
Man075_Man076_0462,being she is with all the baggage of
Man075_Man076_0463,growing up before the baggage of you
Man075_Man076_0464,know she smoked in the house you know in
Man075_Man076_0465,front of me and i could get sick or i
Man075_Man076_0466,get sick because she smoked or no
Man075_Man076_0467,child or or but that is that a change in
Man075_Man076_0468,me what change in me is a so you're
Man075_Man076_0469,saying just change my perspective your
Man075_Man076_0470,perspective exactly just just changed
Man075_Man076_0471,your perspective there shoots letting go
Man075_Man076_0472,of the shoots of all that in just the
Man075_Man076_0473,perspective because I know that you're
Man075_Man076_0474,ready are that they are kept of of just
Man075_Man076_0475,loving loving a human being without in
Man075_Man076_0476,spite of the circumstances so if you
Man075_Man076_0477,could extend that to your mom you know
Man075_Man076_0478,so let's let's look at some of the
Man075_Man076_0479,friends the people that you love and
Man075_Man076_0480,accept regardless of how they are I mean
Man075_Man076_0481,you just like they're your friends that
Man075_Man076_0482,your family record lists of
Man075_Man076_0483,disagreements or whatever so I just
Man075_Man076_0484,think that guys know that's a good point
Man075_Man076_0485,and I want to
Man075_Man076_0486,how have I changed since we met and how
Man075_Man076_0487,do you honestly feel about it have you
Man075_Man076_0488,changed since we met
Man075_Man076_0489,I don't really know that I think that
Man075_Man076_0490,you have changed much mm-hmm how have
Man075_Man076_0491,you changed I don't know that you've
Man075_Man076_0492,changed mmm you're you're pretty
Man075_Man076_0493,consistent how have you changed and what
Man075_Man076_0494,honestly feel about it
Man075_Man076_0495,I don't have an answer I guess what do
Man075_Man076_0496,you think is the hardest thing for me
Man075_Man076_0497,right now
Man075_Man076_0498,I think mmm
Man075_Man076_0499,I'm gonna give you two answers okay on
Man075_Man076_0500,the one hand it's it is really seeing
Man075_Man076_0501,mom going through her process dealing
Man075_Man076_0502,with mom's dementia and and that you
Man075_Man076_0503,know and seeing that also have to
Man075_Man076_0504,grapple with it to deal with it yeah I
Man075_Man076_0505,think I think that's the most
Man075_Man076_0506,significant so I'm gonna stick with just
Man075_Man076_0507,one answer I'm glad I did not wear
Man075_Man076_0508,mascara today because it's my turn okay
Man075_Man076_0509,what would make you leave me I mean
Man075_Man076_0510,probably just a few chose someone else
Man075_Man076_0511,you know if you would leave me
Man075_Man076_0512,these also you know because we go to
Man075_Man076_0513,some pretty sometimes we go to
Man075_Man076_0514,conventional their traditional
Man075_Man076_0515,conservative churches so if you if you
Man075_Man076_0516,got healed okay I'll probably I probably
Man075_Man076_0517,I'm not sure but I I thought about it
Man075_Man076_0518,before I'm going first me back to Texas
Man075_Man076_0519,some of these people are praying for you
Man075_Man076_0520,to get healed
Man075_Man076_0521,I don't even if I can stay in the town
Man075_Man076_0522,Stevie uh-huh just so you know I don't
Man075_Man076_0523,pray for healing I think it's my turn
Man075_Man076_0524,when when you aren't the place that what
Man075_Man076_0525,you define is successful mm-hmm you know
Man075_Man076_0526,and you know when you're famous and
Man075_Man076_0527,super super wealthy
Man075_Man076_0528,are you gonna still want this invitation
Man075_Man076_0529,mean our marriage our marriage yes well
Man075_Man076_0530,I think that by then I could afford a
Man075_Man076_0531,couple of other people so yes of course
Man075_Man076_0532,of course and what I mean by that is
Man075_Man076_0533,like we said before I want to be there
Man075_Man076_0534,to take care of you the same way that
Man075_Man076_0535,you take care of me daily by worrying it
Man075_Man076_0536,might be boring
Man075_Man076_0537,I think I'm successful already even
Man075_Man076_0538,though there's no money and I think that
Man075_Man076_0539,I'm successful because because of you
Man075_Man076_0540,that that you have created this
Man075_Man076_0541,opportunity for me you you have provided
Man075_Man076_0542,an opportunity for me in the past and I
Man075_Man076_0543,so long I so long to be able to not here
Man075_Man076_0544,not feel successful here but really to
Man075_Man076_0545,be able to be successful financially so
Man075_Man076_0546,that I could do the same you know you
Man075_Man076_0547,you you talked about we talked about
Man075_Man076_0548,earlier you alluded to that a little bit
Man075_Man076_0549,that that you feel that maybe like
Man075_Man076_0550,teaching is no longer an option for you
Man075_Man076_0551,because you have passed ad because you
Man075_Man076_0552,are 50 or whatever so one of the things
Man075_Man076_0553,that I dream about is to be able to say
Man075_Man076_0554,Doug we don't need you to go to work
Man075_Man076_0555,honestly I mean that would be such a
Man075_Man076_0556,satisfying place to be so if you could
Man075_Man076_0557,go into the pharmacy one day a week just
Man075_Man076_0558,to keep practicing to keep at it and
Man075_Man076_0559,then be able to if you want to study
Man075_Man076_0560,psychology psychology or you wanted to
Man075_Man076_0561,study sociology or whatever you are free
Man075_Man076_0562,to do that so
Man075_Man076_0563,some absolutely absolutely
Man075_Man076_0564,yes because I think that that would take
Man075_Man076_0565,us into this different aspect of of this
Man075_Man076_0566,relationship of what we have you know
Man075_Man076_0567,there are so many facets that we haven't
Man075_Man076_0568,explored so for example travel I mean I
Man075_Man076_0569,know that both of us have traveled in
Man075_Man076_0570,both of us love traveling I know that
Man075_Man076_0571,you dream about living in here honor I
Man075_Man076_0572,want to experience those in those things
Man075_Man076_0573,with you
Man075_Man076_0574,it would cartagena so if i had the
Man075_Man076_0575,platform if I had the ability to provide
Man075_Man076_0576,for us that would be very satisfying
Man075_Man076_0577,hmm what do you think is the biggest
Man075_Man076_0578,challenge to our relationship
Man075_Man076_0579,I would say our physical intimacy hmm
Man075_Man076_0580,sometimes I think our communication
Man075_Man076_0581,style is cuz it's so thorough I kind of
Man075_Man076_0582,want to just be quick but then sometimes
Man075_Man076_0583,not and so those two things mmm so what
Man075_Man076_0584,can we do about it I think we are doing
Man075_Man076_0585,things about it that's the wrong all
Man075_Man076_0586,right in only him then I was looking at
Man075_Man076_0587,what you asked me okay what was it what
Man075_Man076_0588,what I asked you know I asked you I
Man075_Man076_0589,asked it to you what did I ask you what
Man075_Man076_0590,do you think is the biggest challenge to
Man075_Man076_0591,relationships so you know I for me it's
Man075_Man076_0592,been the same you haven't asked it but I
Man075_Man076_0593,think I want to answer it is because for
Man075_Man076_0594,us you know you fantasize about what a
Man075_Man076_0595,marriage is and although it's a cliche I
Man075_Man076_0596,really thought that you know man I can't
Man075_Man076_0597,wait to be in a relationship to have sex
Man075_Man076_0598,daily you know and it's such a challenge
Man075_Man076_0599,to do not have that matched and so it's
Man075_Man076_0600,such a source of internal friction you
Man075_Man076_0601,know so yeah let's work on it
Man075_Man076_0602,is that I am going to ask another one
Man075_Man076_0603,because you only have one left and I
Man075_Man076_0604,have three own oh yeah that's fine huh
Man075_Man076_0605,what is one experience you wish we never
Man075_Man076_0606,had one experience wish we never wish we
Man075_Man076_0607,never had
Man075_Man076_0608,I don't know I don't know I don't
Man075_Man076_0609,experience
Man075_Man076_0610,like it yeah I cannot think of do you
Man075_Man076_0611,want to get to the same place no oh yeah
Man075_Man076_0612,you cuz I have one yeah it may not even
Man075_Man076_0613,be a question sure sure
Man075_Man076_0614,what is the secret that you have been
Man075_Man076_0615,too afraid to tell me
Man075_Man076_0616,I
Man075_Man076_0617,it's not a secret but in my previous
Man075_Man076_0618,marriage there were issues of physical
Man075_Man076_0619,intimacy issues mm-hmm and so I might be
Man075_Man076_0620,a secret I'm afraid to even bring it up
Man075_Man076_0621,with me I don't know I'm the source of
Man075_Man076_0622,that or not because the previous
Man075_Man076_0623,marriage she there's something happened
Man075_Man076_0624,to her and so it was easy to say that's
Man075_Man076_0625,the reason mmm and so I'm not sure that
Man075_Man076_0626,I can say that for our physical intimacy
Man075_Man076_0627,mm-hmm barriers
Man075_Man076_0628,what do you love about me that I don't
Man075_Man076_0629,see with myself mmm what do you love
Man075_Man076_0630,about me that I don't see with myself
Man075_Man076_0631,hmm you have you have certain in spite
Man075_Man076_0632,of your experiences you have such an
Man075_Man076_0633,innocent spirit such a such a man just
Man075_Man076_0634,loving spirit you know there's just
Man075_Man076_0635,something about you that it's just
Man075_Man076_0636,beautiful beautiful and I'm not sure you
Man075_Man076_0637,see it you see it if there's just it's
Man075_Man076_0638,not a gullible spirit but it's a spirit
Man075_Man076_0639,that is just like so curious loving open

Man075_Man076_0644,there's not a reason or a thing and this
Man075_Man076_0645,is why it's so valuable
