Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0077,about like why would make it work now
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0078,knowing that like we're gonna miss each
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0079,other at the high school mm-hmm I would
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0080,say it's just because like I'm really
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0081,happy right now and like just because I
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0082,know that like that happiness might end

Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0097,to answer that question the best I could
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0098,I would say do you think we'll ever get
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0099,back together at some point in the
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0100,future
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0101,do you know what I thought you're
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0102,supposed to be answering it I'm not sure
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0103,this is different from saying do I want
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0104,us to get back together in the future
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0105,knowing that we're gonna go our separate
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0106,ways most likely from college I would I
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0107,would love that but do I think it'll
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0108,happen who knows it depends like they're
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0109,going you know whatever you know if
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0110,that's Massachusetts or like Delaware
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0111,Minnesota and I'm most likely gonna be
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0112,like here in the city I'm sure we'll see
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0113,each other again but like we get back
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0114,together I'm not sure but I would love
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0115,if that happen
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0116,still my time because that was my
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0117,question
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0118,what do you think you missed out on what
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0119,do you think you missed out on a while
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0120,being in this relationship if I had to
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0121,say like something maybe it would it
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0122,would be like me being more socially
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0123,independent you know what I mean cuz
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0124,like I have my own friends but I usually
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0125,like I feel like I cycle out friends
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0126,based on like a relationship I'm in and
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0127,like my significant others friends and
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0128,so I don't like that's not really
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0129,specific to this relationship it's more
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0130,just like what if I missed out on by
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0131,being in relationships is like a chance
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0132,to be socially independent like for
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0133,myself
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0134,why don't you need me anymore I don't
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0135,answer that question me that again
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0136,why don't you need me anymore I don't
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0137,think it's like a matter of like I mean
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0138,do you need okay

Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0144,things that you want to do and like
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0145,regardless of what other people think
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0146,you should be doing and so I don't want
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0147,you to feel like you're caught in
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0148,something that you had no intention of
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0149,being in and just sort of being stuck
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0150,what's one thing you don't want to
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0151,forget about me
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0152,no you don't want me to forget about you
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0153,what's one thing you don't want me to
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0154,forget about you and I think you're
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0155,special
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0156,I think you
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0157,that's not about you about me yeah
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0158,something about you thought I was like I
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0159,want you to forget that I was cool what
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0160,happens Tyler's me meant to you I don't
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0161,know I mean like it's been really good
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0162,and it's been really challenging and
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0163,it's been really different I think it's
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0164,just meant like a sort of like closing
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0165,of my child out of it I mean I feel like
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0166,my childhood and like a really a long
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0167,time ago but if I had to like say that
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0168,it like meant something and like the
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0169,context of my entire life that's
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0170,probably some meaning I would assign to
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0171,it but I don't I don't know yeah
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0172,how do you feel about me being with
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0173,someone else we had like a problem with
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0174,Jake before like and I've learned from
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0175,that but like now I think I was like at
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0176,that time I think I was immature in a
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0177,way and I didn't like understand but
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0178,being with you longer it's like made me
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0179,realize that like it's great just to
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0180,know you and like I'm okay with knowing
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0181,that like when you find somebody else
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0182,like that she'll be happy and like that
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0183,okay what are you going to take away
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0184,from this relationship um communication
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0185,is really important like really really
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0186,really really really really important
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0187,more important than you think and that

Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0189,outside of my control
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0190,that I feel like I'm more used to being
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0191,in my control and that sometimes I'll be
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0192,in situations where I don't like have as
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0193,much control as I would like but I have
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0194,to manage it anyways like man it's my
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0195,lack of control yeah that's what I'm
Man029_Woman034_Transcription_0196,taking away okay
