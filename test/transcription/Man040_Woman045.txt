Man040_Woman045_0001,what was the moment you felt closest to
Man040_Woman045_0002,me
Man040_Woman045_0003,besides birth I would say when we're
Man040_Woman045_0004,driving cross-country and racing they
Man040_Woman045_0005,were totally in sync and I love hearing
Man040_Woman045_0006,your stories just letting the road go by
Man040_Woman045_0007,and not having the radio on and it seems
Man040_Woman045_0008,the whenever we do those road trips all
Man040_Woman045_0009,the stories come out that normally
Man040_Woman045_0010,aren't told tell me about the first time
Man040_Woman045_0011,we met well that was the moment of your
Man040_Woman045_0012,birth and you were really in a hurry so
Man040_Woman045_0013,actually you were almost born in then in
Man040_Woman045_0014,the lobby of our house the second time
Man040_Woman045_0015,in front of the library and the third
Man040_Woman045_0016,time in the elevator
Man040_Woman045_0017,so yeah you were so ready to get out in
Man040_Woman045_0018,the world and see what it's all about
Man040_Woman045_0019,and said that was the moment I I I saw
Man040_Woman045_0020,you first and that's like every mother
Man040_Woman045_0021,really one notice about that because
Man040_Woman045_0022,it's it's just so magical and so it's a
Man040_Woman045_0023,miracle and and you still let Marik oh
Man040_Woman045_0024,and you're still it magical is it a
Man040_Woman045_0025,stronger bond or a different bond
Man040_Woman045_0026,between when Roland was born and when I
Man040_Woman045_0027,was born how is it different
Man040_Woman045_0028,that was interesting
Man040_Woman045_0029,simply because I I was actually worried
Man040_Woman045_0030,about that you know so how can I divide
Man040_Woman045_0031,the love
Man040_Woman045_0032,that I had for your mother how would I
Man040_Woman045_0033,share that with with another child I
Man040_Woman045_0034,mean how do I do that and your father
Man040_Woman045_0035,was very helpful because one day he said
Man040_Woman045_0036,you know life is not like a piece of
Man040_Woman045_0037,pizza
Man040_Woman045_0038,it's you slice it up and then it's gone
Man040_Woman045_0039,it is actually generating love and I've
Man040_Woman045_0040,made it very clear to me and so I I took
Man040_Woman045_0041,it that way and it's really has has
Man040_Woman045_0042,become that way that you generated your
Man040_Woman045_0043,own part of the emotion and the love
Man040_Woman045_0044,that you brought into my life and that
Man040_Woman045_0045,if I give back and continuously will
Man040_Woman045_0046,give back because it's easy you make it
Man040_Woman045_0047,easy
Man040_Woman045_0048,what are you hesitant to tell me not
Man040_Woman045_0049,much I think we're pretty lucky that
Man040_Woman045_0050,we've always had two very clear open
Man040_Woman045_0051,communication maybe it's cuz roll and I
Man040_Woman045_0052,were both homeschooled so there was
Man040_Woman045_0053,never a distance between us I don't have
Man040_Woman045_0054,anything yet
Man040_Woman045_0055,no one's pregnant that I know of so
Man040_Woman045_0056,that's kids but even then I wouldn't be
Man040_Woman045_0057,hesitant to tell you which is nice I
Man040_Woman045_0058,think that's probably the best thing
Man040_Woman045_0059,about our our relationship by the way I
Man040_Woman045_0060,mean that's key for profound connection
Man040_Woman045_0061,I think is that one can talk about
Man040_Woman045_0062,everything and that it isn't you know
Man040_Woman045_0063,valuated or that you know it's just yeah
Man040_Woman045_0064,I think it's so important that
Man040_Woman045_0065,relationships are organically growing
Man040_Woman045_0066,and the bad part comes with a good part
Man040_Woman045_0067,I mean it's just how it is in life so it
Man040_Woman045_0068,has to get through that so I I'm really
Man040_Woman045_0069,really glad that you feel that way and I
Man040_Woman045_0070,was also actually always proud when for
Man040_Woman045_0071,instance you know I mean mother-son I
Man040_Woman045_0072,mean I don't know if that is natural
Man040_Woman045_0073,it's natural to me that you would come
Man040_Woman045_0074,with things that were very personal you
Man040_Woman045_0075,know first erotic
Man040_Woman045_0076,discoveries or just you know I mean I I
Man040_Woman045_0077,remember that I remember you know I was
Man040_Woman045_0078,in Europe and you were in the United
Man040_Woman045_0079,States and you called me and you said
Man040_Woman045_0080,this has happened and and I was I didn't
Man040_Woman045_0081,hear the link to where you can see it
Man040_Woman045_0082,but you know and I remember that's so
Man040_Woman045_0083,clear that I thought how lucky am I
Man040_Woman045_0084,that my son is telling me what he feels
Man040_Woman045_0085,because of his first really meaningful I
Man040_Woman045_0086,mean the first I think I thought I was
Man040_Woman045_0087,elated
Man040_Woman045_0088,I was just no I was just saying more
Man040_Woman045_0089,Facebook's I couldn't status update it I
Man040_Woman045_0090,caught a lot of people that was then I
Man040_Woman045_0091,knew that somehow something was done
Man040_Woman045_0092,right in in order to give foundation to
Man040_Woman045_0093,our relationship and yeah thank you for
Man040_Woman045_0094,that that you did that
Man040_Woman045_0095,when do you feel closest to me when you
Man040_Woman045_0096,are having difficulties you know like
Man040_Woman045_0097,every every time in life one has to you
Man040_Woman045_0098,know you grow it's a growing process and
Man040_Woman045_0099,in order to grow it's always pain and a
Man040_Woman045_0100,little bit you know it's like steady but
Man040_Woman045_0101,we shedding bark or something because it
Man040_Woman045_0102,grows stronger so it has to shed things
Man040_Woman045_0103,and I think that's the same thing and
Man040_Woman045_0104,it's us with human beings and so when
Man040_Woman045_0105,you are in there in a tight spot I I
Man040_Woman045_0106,haven't known I can feel that and I feel
Man040_Woman045_0107,very close and I have to hold back
Man040_Woman045_0108,because I need to not want to solve it
Man040_Woman045_0109,for you you know and so I I feel very
Man040_Woman045_0110,because our birthdays are so close
Man040_Woman045_0111,together we're you know this all dates
Man040_Woman045_0112,are as sometimes you you it's just
Man040_Woman045_0113,amazing I mean you say something I've
Man040_Woman045_0114,just thought you know
Man040_Woman045_0115,and or vice versa or you start a
Man040_Woman045_0116,sentence and gets completed it's
Man040_Woman045_0117,unbelievable this is a I it's really a
Man040_Woman045_0118,wonderful thing that that can happen
Man040_Woman045_0119,that way so yeah that is when I feel
Man040_Woman045_0120,very close to you and interesting enough
Man040_Woman045_0121,I also feel phenomenal that we vibrate
Man040_Woman045_0122,on the same level when we car race I
Man040_Woman045_0123,mean there's no question it is it is I
Man040_Woman045_0124,feel what you think what is your next
Man040_Woman045_0125,action and hope that I do the same thing
Man040_Woman045_0126,or give the same you know helpful hints
Man040_Woman045_0127,as a co-driver so it that there it's
Man040_Woman045_0128,really merging into one phenomenal
Man040_Woman045_0129,I think it's my turn yes so
Man040_Woman045_0130,what do you love about me that I don't
Man040_Woman045_0131,see within myself that you're extremely
Man040_Woman045_0132,accomplished already I think that you
Man040_Woman045_0133,sometimes feel you need to prove
Man040_Woman045_0134,yourself and keep doing it over and over
Man040_Woman045_0135,and over again and it's never good
Man040_Woman045_0136,enough it cannot always be bigger and
Man040_Woman045_0137,better whether it's in your architecture
Man040_Woman045_0138,whether it's and anything that you do
Man040_Woman045_0139,let you pursue your perfectionist and I
Man040_Woman045_0140,think you just have to be okay with the
Man040_Woman045_0141,fact that you are as accomplished as as
Man040_Woman045_0142,you are
Man040_Woman045_0143,what are your three favorite memories
Man040_Woman045_0144,that we've shared oh very interesting
Man040_Woman045_0145,and and and fully loaded pursuit in life
Man040_Woman045_0146,with lots of it adventures because we do
Man040_Woman045_0147,live a very adventurous life it's a
Man040_Woman045_0148,choice I don't even know where to start
Man040_Woman045_0149,I've no clue but I I love one thing
Man040_Woman045_0150,because of the feeling and the early on
Man040_Woman045_0151,that when you when you were small you
Man040_Woman045_0152,were about four years old
Man040_Woman045_0153,and we used to live very isolated on an
Man040_Woman045_0154,island remember and and we we had never
Man040_Woman045_0155,really painted in the way that I mean it
Man040_Woman045_0156,was you know children's painting and
Man040_Woman045_0157,hand paintings and and so and I remember
Man040_Woman045_0158,we were on the terrace and all the
Man040_Woman045_0159,things were lying there and I was doing
Man040_Woman045_0160,myself in my work there and all of a
Man040_Woman045_0161,sudden you took a piece of paper and you
Man040_Woman045_0162,started drawing and I just thought it
Man040_Woman045_0163,was amazing I was just I mean you blew
Man040_Woman045_0164,me away
Man040_Woman045_0165,I mean that was that was amazing and and
Man040_Woman045_0166,I thought you have a good eye because it
Man040_Woman045_0167,showed that you had you know that that
Man040_Woman045_0168,everything I don't know it gave me great
Man040_Woman045_0169,confidence for you and then the the
Man040_Woman045_0170,story times you know always when we have
Man040_Woman045_0171,story times it's something wonderful be
Man040_Woman045_0172,it early on or now when we talk
Man040_Woman045_0173,and and I do feel because of life and
Man040_Woman045_0174,and and how everybody is busy and you
Man040_Woman045_0175,have other interests etc that I miss
Man040_Woman045_0176,really you know to have more of these
Man040_Woman045_0177,talks because I think if one is very
Man040_Woman045_0178,close one assumes that the other one
Man040_Woman045_0179,knows already what you think but it
Man040_Woman045_0180,isn't
Man040_Woman045_0181,I love communication and I know it here
Man040_Woman045_0182,it shows I think man don't communicate
Man040_Woman045_0183,like I would love that so if we had more
Man040_Woman045_0184,communication in the sense of
Man040_Woman045_0185,development of a talk now which we do in
Man040_Woman045_0186,a car you said it before yeah when the
Man040_Woman045_0187,landscape is passing by and everything
Man040_Woman045_0188,else is you know we're in that bubble it
Man040_Woman045_0189,happens but that bubble in daily life I
Man040_Woman045_0190,think really because I miss that I think
Man040_Woman045_0191,it works in a car because I can be
Man040_Woman045_0192,distracted I think sometimes there's
Man040_Woman045_0193,like pressure if you need to sit in
Man040_Woman045_0194,front of each other any like okay you
Man040_Woman045_0195,need to do it this way can that time
Man040_Woman045_0196,pass and just let the road and then ask
Man040_Woman045_0197,a question naturally comes yeah I do
Man040_Woman045_0198,have another question because you talked
Man040_Woman045_0199,about the painting do you regret that I
Man040_Woman045_0200,didn't go into architecture since you're
Man040_Woman045_0201,a fifth generation and I would have been
Man040_Woman045_0202,the sixth generation yeah it's
Man040_Woman045_0203,fascinating that because this question
Man040_Woman045_0204,only comes up now actually never came up
Man040_Woman045_0205,along the side when choices were meant
Man040_Woman045_0206,for professional pursuit or so and and I
Man040_Woman045_0207,do believe in in the freedom of choice
Man040_Woman045_0208,so I felt very fine at the time that you
Man040_Woman045_0209,were choosing
Man040_Woman045_0210,whether you chose and you're choosing
Man040_Woman045_0211,continuously to develop in in your
Man040_Woman045_0212,professional field but as I'm going on
Man040_Woman045_0213,in life and see really the the legacy of
Man040_Woman045_0214,a family and I do really think would be
Man040_Woman045_0215,wonderful but then of course you know in
Man040_Woman045_0216,conversation your brother said oh this
Man040_Woman045_0217,is the century way can be an architect
Man040_Woman045_0218,in many different forms because
Man040_Woman045_0219,architecture means organization of
Man040_Woman045_0220,people spaces and so perhaps you pursue
Man040_Woman045_0221,architecture just in a different form so
Man040_Woman045_0222,that is fine with me and you never know
Man040_Woman045_0223,I mean you know people change
Man040_Woman045_0224,professions all you know all the time so
Man040_Woman045_0225,perhaps one day you decide that all of a
Man040_Woman045_0226,sudden by natural instinct and you have
Man040_Woman045_0227,you know you learn it autumn because how
Man040_Woman045_0228,can you not learn by seeing all the
Man040_Woman045_0229,stuff around seeing buildings go up see
Man040_Woman045_0230,that you know much more than you think
Man040_Woman045_0231,and who knows one day perhaps you give
Man040_Woman045_0232,us all the surprise or you know oh don't
Man040_Woman045_0233,worry I've started minecraft so I'm on
Man040_Woman045_0234,the way so I think it's your turn isn't
Man040_Woman045_0235,me okay so it says in green color when
Man040_Woman045_0236,do you worry about me and why
Man040_Woman045_0237,I worry about you more now because I
Man040_Woman045_0238,know you're very stressed on multiple
Man040_Woman045_0239,different levels project and personal
Man040_Woman045_0240,and I can see that it takes a toll on
Man040_Woman045_0241,your health and you're my mother and
Man040_Woman045_0242,you're supposed to be super mother
Man040_Woman045_0243,always be strong and be able to do
Man040_Woman045_0244,everything and I do feel now that
Man040_Woman045_0245,there's a transition in which I need to
Man040_Woman045_0246,start taking more responsibility so that
Man040_Woman045_0247,I can alleviate the pressures and stress
Man040_Woman045_0248,of life for you and so I don't want you
Man040_Woman045_0249,to burn out even though o me did say
Man040_Woman045_0250,you're a candle burning at both ends you
Man040_Woman045_0251,know I think she's pretty right and
Man040_Woman045_0252,maybe it's okay just to burn on one end
Man040_Woman045_0253,but burn really brightly
Man040_Woman045_0254,in what ways are we similar and how does
Man040_Woman045_0255,that scare you
Man040_Woman045_0256,well we both have love for speech not
Man040_Woman045_0257,the drug driving yes yeah well I mean
Man040_Woman045_0258,forward movement yes I would not be
Man040_Woman045_0259,wearing short sleeves then well um if it
Man040_Woman045_0260,is skiing or if it is anything that's
Man040_Woman045_0261,lost you know we like it and a little
Man040_Woman045_0262,bit competitive yeah then comes the
Man040_Woman045_0263,competitive on top of it and then the
Man040_Woman045_0264,thought ah I think I can do this and
Man040_Woman045_0265,then all of a sudden you know yeah go
Man040_Woman045_0266,for it so yeah I think that's that's
Man040_Woman045_0267,probably the point but I don't know I I
Man040_Woman045_0268,have decided early on in my life that I
Man040_Woman045_0269,wanted to live an adventurous life and
Man040_Woman045_0270,that I would live in and benders life
Man040_Woman045_0271,and I do so how in the heck can I just
Man040_Woman045_0272,you know not expect that that is rubbing
Man040_Woman045_0273,off so I think and it's just great when
Man040_Woman045_0274,when we were in that sphere while we're
Man040_Woman045_0275,doing some very interesting things we're
Man040_Woman045_0276,pushing the envelope definitely if it is
Man040_Woman045_0277,where we go in you know Alaska you know
Man040_Woman045_0278,I mean these these events the glacier
Man040_Woman045_0279,drop-off and all these kind of things I
Man040_Woman045_0280,mean Madagascar was flying in an orderly
Man040_Woman045_0281,or with his pinnacles and changing
Man040_Woman045_0282,petrol and I mean in an ultra-light I
Man040_Woman045_0283,mean that's just really yeah I guess so
Man040_Woman045_0284,but it also makes you feel so much alive
Man040_Woman045_0285,you know when it all works I but the
Man040_Woman045_0286,love of life is of course stronger than
Man040_Woman045_0287,anything and and I hope that we
Man040_Woman045_0288,installed also in both of you and your
Man040_Woman045_0289,brother and you a sense of survival you
Man040_Woman045_0290,know that you don't go crazy and say
Man040_Woman045_0291,well I prove myself so I think plenty of
Man040_Woman045_0292,examples to show in which that should
Man040_Woman045_0293,not be a case that you followed
Man040_Woman045_0294,yourselves yeah I always think I think I
Man040_Woman045_0295,just hoped for protecting angels you
Man040_Woman045_0296,know not just one just almost not enough
Man040_Woman045_0297,but so whose turn is it behind sir sir
Man040_Woman045_0298,is it okay for still on the green mould
Man040_Woman045_0299,Oh what moments did you feel that I
Man040_Woman045_0300,abandoned you never that's pretty much
Man040_Woman045_0301,yeah if anything it would be the inverse
Man040_Woman045_0302,of that whatever sense of abandon
Man040_Woman045_0303,abandonment now you're always there
Man040_Woman045_0304,definitely I probably abandon you plenty
Man040_Woman045_0305,of times but you know I don't know I
Man040_Woman045_0306,think it's pretty lucky to have a very
Man040_Woman045_0307,strong mother who basically able to do
Man040_Woman045_0308,whatever shouldn't I think yeah you said
Man040_Woman045_0309,a really difficult tone for me finding
Man040_Woman045_0310,any sort of girl in my life because they
Man040_Woman045_0311,not only have to be an astronaut and
Man040_Woman045_0312,saving you know babies every day and you
Man040_Woman045_0313,know hyper creative and things like that
Man040_Woman045_0314,and very accomplished you know it's very
Man040_Woman045_0315,was a very high bar so I basically have
Man040_Woman045_0316,to look for that girl but there was
Man040_Woman045_0317,never any abandonment whatsoever maybe
Man040_Woman045_0318,sometimes I was hoping for it but I hope
Man040_Woman045_0319,she forgets me in the toy store yeah
Man040_Woman045_0320,okay so if you could change one thing
Man040_Woman045_0321,about how you raised me what would it be
Man040_Woman045_0322,and why
Man040_Woman045_0323,I think I would do one thing you are
Man040_Woman045_0324,very very good in your body motion and
Man040_Woman045_0325,you know I don't know what that's called
Man040_Woman045_0326,when you're coordinated and you're just
Man040_Woman045_0327,really an amazing athlete and I think if
Man040_Woman045_0328,I change anything I would would have
Man040_Woman045_0329,perhaps guided it more to a highly
Man040_Woman045_0330,competitive sport somewhere that you
Man040_Woman045_0331,would have found but be truly going into
Man040_Woman045_0332,a competitive mode because I think you
Man040_Woman045_0333,would have found great joy in that that
Man040_Woman045_0334,I see only now that I have learned
Man040_Woman045_0335,things in life I didn't see it at the
Man040_Woman045_0336,time you know because I thought it was
Man040_Woman045_0337,important to be able to do many things
Man040_Woman045_0338,so that you would feel secure in any
Man040_Woman045_0339,sport that would come in front of you
Man040_Woman045_0340,but I think I think it would have also
Man040_Woman045_0341,liked to Remini where you've been not
Man040_Woman045_0342,where your phenomenal skier you could
Man040_Woman045_0343,have gone very far in skiing for sure
Man040_Woman045_0344,and so in any other sports that you
Man040_Woman045_0345,would you set your mind and I think
Man040_Woman045_0346,would have been great at archery I would
Man040_Woman045_0347,have hit something so competitive I
Man040_Woman045_0348,gotta get to the end of the pile first
Man040_Woman045_0349,what's one lesson or value that I taught
Man040_Woman045_0350,you I I need to sound out the words
Man040_Woman045_0351,mother to try this this is gonna work
Man040_Woman045_0352,out what's one lesson or value that I
Man040_Woman045_0353,taught you now know is false or
Man040_Woman045_0354,hungry ate what's one listener value
Man040_Woman045_0355,that's I taught you how that you now
Man040_Woman045_0356,know okay that you now know is false or
Man040_Woman045_0357,a mistake and why who artificial
Man040_Woman045_0358,deadlines you're very good at giving
Man040_Woman045_0359,artificial deadlines if you must finish
Man040_Woman045_0360,this I don't know I think it's a German
Man040_Woman045_0361,thing that's it took Poland in three
Man040_Woman045_0362,days but to say I think it's yeah
Man040_Woman045_0363,definitely artificial deadlines we need
Man040_Woman045_0364,to do this right away it's really
Man040_Woman045_0365,important and they have to get there why
Man040_Woman045_0366,am i is it because I it's I don't know
Man040_Woman045_0367,okay all right we've all died running
Man040_Woman045_0368,across the desert to get here but a
Man040_Woman045_0369,heart attacks along the way do you think
Man040_Woman045_0370,I'm happy in my current relationship by
Man040_Woman045_0371,the way your hair the other side okay do
Man040_Woman045_0372,you think I'm happy in my current
Man040_Woman045_0373,relationship well that's a very poignant
Man040_Woman045_0374,question and bulls-eye question you well
Man040_Woman045_0375,I certainly hope that you are I don't
Man040_Woman045_0376,know that's the motherly thing but I
Man040_Woman045_0377,think it's really really difficult to
Man040_Woman045_0378,find a great mate you know there's no
Man040_Woman045_0379,question about it and and and one has to
Man040_Woman045_0380,just figure that out that I certainly
Man040_Woman045_0381,hope for the best but
Man040_Woman045_0382,I I think what's important in looking
Man040_Woman045_0383,for the right relationship it's not what
Man040_Woman045_0384,is here and now it is is where's the
Man040_Woman045_0385,potential to grow you know individually
Man040_Woman045_0386,and and together because you know it's a
Man040_Woman045_0387,long time and this takes a pretty high
Man040_Woman045_0388,if you raise a family so I know I'm
Man040_Woman045_0389,totally play by my self in jeopardy here
Man040_Woman045_0390,but you know whoever I am currently with
Man040_Woman045_0391,in my relationship if they just want to
Man040_Woman045_0392,tune out now of everybody that I've been
Man040_Woman045_0393,with in my life who would you like or
Man040_Woman045_0394,would have liked to see me actually
Man040_Woman045_0395,develop more of a relationship with
Man040_Woman045_0396,marriage children well they were
Man040_Woman045_0397,probably not the girls that you were
Man040_Woman045_0398,pursuing there were some girls in the
Man040_Woman045_0399,vicinity that of having that kind of
Man040_Woman045_0400,potential tell me that now great okay
Man040_Woman045_0401,but your friends married them and so I
Man040_Woman045_0402,think now you would have because if it
Man040_Woman045_0403,were if it was right the point is you're
Man040_Woman045_0404,you you have good senses and and I think
Man040_Woman045_0405,I think you will make a very good
Man040_Woman045_0406,decision and and because of who you are
Man040_Woman045_0407,and and simply of what you your you know
Man040_Woman045_0408,what makes you who you are
Man040_Woman045_0409,I really I trusted completely that that
Man040_Woman045_0410,is the case I just would hope that it is
Man040_Woman045_0411,not so painful for everybody so even if
Man040_Woman045_0412,I show up with hi this tyrone and we are
Man040_Woman045_0413,gonna adopt some beautiful babies would
Man040_Woman045_0414,you be okay with that
Man040_Woman045_0415,that
Man040_Woman045_0416,is I don't know I come from a very
Man040_Woman045_0417,traditional family and and I do believe
Man040_Woman045_0418,in children that are originated children
Man040_Woman045_0419,if it can be you know and but then life
Man040_Woman045_0420,throws curveballs who knows what that is
Man040_Woman045_0421,and so I think a simple form of having
Man040_Woman045_0422,you know or an organic good form is is
Man040_Woman045_0423,is is probably a good thing for one
Man040_Woman045_0424,reason because life is so complicated
Man040_Woman045_0425,anyway and then it's just beautifully
Man040_Woman045_0426,decorated our apartment will be it'll be
Man040_Woman045_0427,fabulous
Man040_Woman045_0428,I don't know well manicured lawn it'll
Man040_Woman045_0429,be and you get to help pick the child
Man040_Woman045_0430,that I you know what's interesting
Man040_Woman045_0431,because we have a lots of friends that
Man040_Woman045_0432,live that way and they live wonderfully
Man040_Woman045_0433,that way and I think it's great and I am
Man040_Woman045_0434,in you know helping in all aspect how I
Man040_Woman045_0435,can to make those relationships you know
Man040_Woman045_0436,grow but if I have to look truthfully in
Man040_Woman045_0437,my heart I would hope that you have a
Man040_Woman045_0438,traditional way of having children was
Man040_Woman045_0439,was a woman that is growing with you and
Man040_Woman045_0440,actually you and and you enable each
Man040_Woman045_0441,other because I think I see so many
Man040_Woman045_0442,relationships where where they you know
Man040_Woman045_0443,they just they almost stifle each other
Man040_Woman045_0444,because I don't know what it is fear
Man040_Woman045_0445,each other or whatever instead of the
Man040_Woman045_0446,true of a good relationship where you
Man040_Woman045_0447,just enable each other to be the best
Man040_Woman045_0448,you can be yeah so that is it and I
Man040_Woman045_0449,think that is one next to look for that
Man040_Woman045_0450,potential in the person because a long
Man040_Woman045_0451,life you you you know everybody here in
Man040_Woman045_0452,the room will live on till you're 100
Man040_Woman045_0453,you know so should be a good choice that
Man040_Woman045_0454,must grow and cannot be judged by what
Man040_Woman045_0455,is now I think the issue is that people
Man040_Woman045_0456,they need to give each other the gift of
Man040_Woman045_0457,missing one another because often the
Man040_Woman045_0458,stifling comes when you're just
Man040_Woman045_0459,consoling together and the reason one
Man040_Woman045_0460,falls in love with somebody is because
Man040_Woman045_0461,you have outside they're new and unique
Man040_Woman045_0462,and different and so they have to have
Man040_Woman045_0463,other interests outside or just the
Man040_Woman045_0464,relationship otherwise then it just gets
Man040_Woman045_0465,left out so I agree with you and don't
Man040_Woman045_0466,worry Tyrone's not showing it that's
Man040_Woman045_0467,right I think so yeah okay this is
Man040_Woman045_0468,blackface no what is one experience you
Man040_Woman045_0469,wish we never had one experience a
Man040_Woman045_0470,certain somebody getting arrested I
Man040_Woman045_0471,would say that yeah moving swiftly along
Man040_Woman045_0472,okay what's the sacrifice that you've
Man040_Woman045_0473,made that I have that I've failed to
Man040_Woman045_0474,acknowledge
Man040_Woman045_0475,Wow I don't think because I mean no I
Man040_Woman045_0476,don't think I don't think any God I have
Man040_Woman045_0477,to think about it a sacrifice that you
Man040_Woman045_0478,didn't acknowledge pack the bags honey
Man040_Woman045_0479,let's go on a guilt trip just let me
Man040_Woman045_0480,feel it
Man040_Woman045_0481,no no oh yes when we moved and nobody
Man040_Woman045_0482,showed up and I had to do all the things
Man040_Woman045_0483,with one very very dear friend who
Man040_Woman045_0484,absolutely came to my side I can't still
Man040_Woman045_0485,don't know what but you know that was a
Man040_Woman045_0486,mega move and everybody thought that
Man040_Woman045_0487,they didn't need to show up my did
Man040_Woman045_0488,entire family didn't show up for it and
Man040_Woman045_0489,when and then you all said oh you're so
Man040_Woman045_0490,capable exactly I do not take blame
Man040_Woman045_0491,because you raised us to know that we
Man040_Woman045_0492,had a super a woman that mother who's
Man040_Woman045_0493,fully capable to do these things so of
Man040_Woman045_0494,course it's perfectly natural to not
Man040_Woman045_0495,show up I I would hope if we ever move
Man040_Woman045_0496,again or something similar that occurs
Man040_Woman045_0497,oh yes I will be there do you wish I had
Man040_Woman045_0498,given you grandchildren by now no no
Man040_Woman045_0499,because you haven't found the right girl
Man040_Woman045_0500,so that wouldn't it be a good thing
Man040_Woman045_0501,obviously do I wish to be still alive
Man040_Woman045_0502,when they're grandchildren yes I thought
Man040_Woman045_0503,very much enjoy that so all I can say I
Man040_Woman045_0504,hope that one day you realize you that's
Man040_Woman045_0505,right
Man040_Woman045_0506,that's the mother of my children because
Man040_Woman045_0507,a whole different story I think
Man040_Woman045_0508,personally to find a lover then to find
Man040_Woman045_0509,the mother of your children
Man040_Woman045_0510,it's a whole different thing so what are
Man040_Woman045_0511,the traits that I need to look for
Man040_Woman045_0512,potential for growth because your
Man040_Woman045_0513,children will you know have all the
Man040_Woman045_0514,qualities etc that you
Man040_Woman045_0515,I believe in elevation in life okay I
Man040_Woman045_0516,think if I'm looking of why we're here
Man040_Woman045_0517,and going through all of us then I think
Man040_Woman045_0518,it is that we are gathering knowledge
Man040_Woman045_0519,and that we are elevating ourselves in
Man040_Woman045_0520,all aspects including in being able to
Man040_Woman045_0521,to love to be ready to receive love and
Man040_Woman045_0522,to have all the experiences that make a
Man040_Woman045_0523,full life so but it is in order to
Man040_Woman045_0524,elevate so and I think therefore again
Man040_Woman045_0525,again I must be potential there so
Man040_Woman045_0526,always look at the mother oh yeah for
Man040_Woman045_0527,the girl definitely definitely and very
Man040_Woman045_0528,seriously I mean not just oh no I don't
Man040_Woman045_0529,think this is not happening
Man040_Woman045_0530,yeah daughters become their mother's
Man040_Woman045_0531,very
Man040_Woman045_0532,what do you think is the hardest thing
Man040_Woman045_0533,for me right now not having my father in
Man040_Woman045_0534,your life more that's true thank you
Man040_Woman045_0535,and the reason being because I think it
Man040_Woman045_0536,is a wonderful thing to actually have
Man040_Woman045_0537,all aspects of girls we just talked
Man040_Woman045_0538,about you know and so but on the other
Man040_Woman045_0539,hand I've been thinking about that it's
Man040_Woman045_0540,also makes one very strong because you
Man040_Woman045_0541,need to deal with that how you need to
Man040_Woman045_0542,just deal with it and find absolutely
Man040_Woman045_0543,balance for the entirety and the family
Man040_Woman045_0544,I believe that really the the balance
Man040_Woman045_0545,within the family is an enormous
Man040_Woman045_0546,important thing it gets mostly done by
Man040_Woman045_0547,one and and so I I just hope I grow so
Man040_Woman045_0548,much into that that I can handle that to
Man040_Woman045_0549,be a very good matriarch you know so and
Man040_Woman045_0550,I was very very surprising
Man040_Woman045_0551,what do you wish you could heal in me
Man040_Woman045_0552,what pain would you take away I think a
Man040_Woman045_0553,similar situation has to do with your
Man040_Woman045_0554,father because it has a specific
Man040_Woman045_0555,expectations for you and as well for
Man040_Woman045_0556,your brother and and I think that you
Man040_Woman045_0557,have used many years to fulfill his
Man040_Woman045_0558,expectations rather than your own
Man040_Woman045_0559,expectations and it is amazing and I
Man040_Woman045_0560,think it is a wonderful thing I'm very
Man040_Woman045_0561,happy for yourself that you found the
Man040_Woman045_0562,point where you found the platform and
Man040_Woman045_0563,the point of the tipping point that you
Man040_Woman045_0564,said no I need to fulfill my own
Man040_Woman045_0565,expectations which you do and pursue and
Man040_Woman045_0566,at this moment in your life and that I
Man040_Woman045_0567,think is very good for you stripping is
Man040_Woman045_0568,a hard career it wasn't for me
Man040_Woman045_0569,what mistakes do you see me making that
Man040_Woman045_0570,you have also made what would you advise
Man040_Woman045_0571,me to do not to respond to the email
Man040_Woman045_0572,from the African Prince that wants your
Man040_Woman045_0573,bank account for 20 million I did it
Man040_Woman045_0574,twice and each time I regret it but if
Man040_Woman045_0575,he's out there I hope he I will send my
Man040_Woman045_0576,details again I've updated them and he
Man040_Woman045_0577,can reach me anytime
Man040_Woman045_0578,yeah but it's the case Wow I mean I said
Man040_Woman045_0579,before life is false
Man040_Woman045_0580,yeah what's the greatest lesson I taught
Man040_Woman045_0581,you
Man040_Woman045_0582,besides not responding to the emails
Man040_Woman045_0583,from the Prince okay well to get along
Man040_Woman045_0584,with my computer really yeah no I'm
Man040_Woman045_0585,without you I may not be in the dark
Man040_Woman045_0586,ages you know I I'm just a generation
Man040_Woman045_0587,where we fall off the chair because or
Man040_Woman045_0588,in between the chairs or what that's
Man040_Woman045_0589,called you know and you just just I mean
Man040_Woman045_0590,that is really great you continuously
Man040_Woman045_0591,make sure that I that I get it and that
Man040_Woman045_0592,I have the right material and that I at
Man040_Woman045_0593,least get the basics so I think now this
Man040_Woman045_0594,is this is really immensely helpful it
Man040_Woman045_0595,was very frustrating to have a mother
Man040_Woman045_0596,he's quite capable and like builds
Man040_Woman045_0597,entire cities and you know as quite an
Man040_Woman045_0598,accomplished career and then to be
Man040_Woman045_0599,totally afraid of a machine and I don't
Man040_Woman045_0600,know how does that an email but but it's
Man040_Woman045_0601,why it was the it was the touch screen
Man040_Woman045_0602,of the iPad that totally changed I mean
Man040_Woman045_0603,amazing including the fact you know that
Man040_Woman045_0604,you one day said why in the heck are you
Man040_Woman045_0605,still drawing on paper
Man040_Woman045_0606,why don't you just decide on this thing
Man040_Woman045_0607,and then one day in up in an airplane I
Man040_Woman045_0608,just you know started in life I think
Man040_Woman045_0609,it's fantastic you know so and I was
Man040_Woman045_0610,very proud the other day when I was
Man040_Woman045_0611,trying to do something on your drawing
Man040_Woman045_0612,piece and I couldn't figure it out and
Man040_Woman045_0613,then you're like well Justin you just
Man040_Woman045_0614,add this layer and then you just
Man040_Woman045_0615,transparent make it transparent just I
Man040_Woman045_0616,was like okay
Man040_Woman045_0617,so that's that's a great thing
Man040_Woman045_0618,I think that's that's a perfect
Man040_Woman045_0619,parent-child relationship is when the
Man040_Woman045_0620,parent you know at first the children
Man040_Woman045_0621,learned from the parents and then the
Man040_Woman045_0622,parents if they are if they're you know
Man040_Woman045_0623,that they I think if they get it then
Man040_Woman045_0624,they should learn from the trauma and
Man040_Woman045_0625,that's fantastic
Man040_Woman045_0626,we just talked on the way here about
Man040_Woman045_0627,what keeps you young you know and that's
Man040_Woman045_0628,a fantastic thing about you and your
Man040_Woman045_0629,brother but especially you I mean
Man040_Woman045_0630,because you include me was all your
Man040_Woman045_0631,friends completely I mean I literally
Man040_Woman045_0632,have no friends in my own age group they
Man040_Woman045_0633,are either clients or the government's I
Man040_Woman045_0634,don't know they are all these this is
Man040_Woman045_0635,the other world but my private world is
Man040_Woman045_0636,your age range and that is no I mean

Man040_Woman045_0649,and it was always you we literally
Man040_Woman045_0650,didn't have to do anything we just
Man040_Woman045_0651,introduced the girls to you and you're
Man040_Woman045_0652,like this uber woman which every girl
Man040_Woman045_0653,loves and thinks this is amazing
Man040_Woman045_0654,I don't know maybe it was a little bit
Man040_Woman045_0655,weird when I had you come to that dinner
Man040_Woman045_0656,on the first date but I think she was a
Man040_Woman045_0657,little bit confused by it but by the end
Man040_Woman045_0658,she was great
Man040_Woman045_0659,now that I think back but yeah okay
Man040_Woman045_0660,moving on what's your greatest fear
Man040_Woman045_0661,about getting older obviously being kind
Man040_Woman045_0662,of a mobile or because I live such a
Man040_Woman045_0663,over reginal life and and and so if that
Man040_Woman045_0664,if the mobility shifts I don't know I'm
Man040_Woman045_0665,not sure how I would handle that though
Man040_Woman045_0666,I prepare myself for it because I know
Man040_Woman045_0667,why the jet pack showed up from Amazon
Man040_Woman045_0668,okay I'm thinking you know so what kind
Man040_Woman045_0669,of projects that I always wanted to do
Man040_Woman045_0670,will I do if that's if that is happening
Man040_Woman045_0671,etc so I'm kind of prepared so I think I
Man040_Woman045_0672,couldn't do that five years and then I
Man040_Woman045_0673,know already what a viable started total
Man040_Woman045_0674,new career when I'm 90 years old so I
Man040_Woman045_0675,know something I've never done before
Man040_Woman045_0676,and and I you know what so it can only
Man040_Woman045_0677,be exciting about that but a true fear
Man040_Woman045_0678,is also I'm a responsible person and
Man040_Woman045_0679,when I get contracts I I really and when
Man040_Woman045_0680,the kind of contracts I have building
Man040_Woman045_0681,communities and a large scale there's
Man040_Woman045_0682,not long you know long distance many
Man040_Woman045_0683,years I want to be able to finish those
Man040_Woman045_0684,you know that that's a thing so and then
Man040_Woman045_0685,I have many artistic projects personally
Man040_Woman045_0686,that I would like to complete and what
Man040_Woman045_0687,I'm saying and I know I frustrate you
Man040_Woman045_0688,sometimes by saying I need to complete
Man040_Woman045_0689,the projects I just have to complete the
Man040_Woman045_0690,things then
Man040_Woman045_0691,that I wouldn't I would like not to
Man040_Woman045_0692,leave unfinished things that are works
Man040_Woman045_0693,that many years have gone into books and
Man040_Woman045_0694,and all kinds of you know the feature
Man040_Woman045_0695,film that I directed me to be finished
Man040_Woman045_0696,but then obviously is always something
Man040_Woman045_0697,else that is it's pressing because these
Man040_Woman045_0698,are giant these are client obligations
Man040_Woman045_0699,and they are always coming first and and
Man040_Woman045_0700,then life is in any case you know my my
Man040_Woman045_0701,case family was always my priority
Man040_Woman045_0702,always my entire life more than any
Man040_Woman045_0703,professional things and so I I wouldn't
Man040_Woman045_0704,like to leave unfinished things that
Man040_Woman045_0705,would be wonderful that would be wish I
Man040_Woman045_0706,have
Man040_Woman045_0707,you wait your turn do you have a moment
Man040_Woman045_0708,that changed the direction in your life
Man040_Woman045_0709,being born definitely had a massive
Man040_Woman045_0710,influence on the direction of my life I
Man040_Woman045_0711,would say my time in Australia and that
Man040_Woman045_0712,relationship influenced me it definitely
Man040_Woman045_0713,made me from a boy to a man because I
Man040_Woman045_0714,realized what I wanted and what I needed
Man040_Woman045_0715,and what I deserved that is true that
Man040_Woman045_0716,was difficult to watch from the far and
Man040_Woman045_0717,you absolutely came out in flying colors
Man040_Woman045_0718,that I there were flames but they were
Man040_Woman045_0719,bright colors but you see this is this
Man040_Woman045_0720,is what life is about having these

Man040_Woman045_0753,it's a good package well I thought about
Man040_Woman045_0754,it
Man040_Woman045_0755,a few years ago because when everyone's
Man040_Woman045_0756,y-you think well Who am I why am i and
Man040_Woman045_0757,all those things and I realized that you
Man040_Woman045_0758,and oh me to a degree but you mostly are
Man040_Woman045_0759,gave me the foundation of Who I am
Man040_Woman045_0760,so the core the most important my values
Man040_Woman045_0761,and everything else daddy gave me a lot
Man040_Woman045_0762,kind of above that but the real solid
Man040_Woman045_0763,main core values and foundation is
Man040_Woman045_0764,definitely for me
Man040_Woman045_0765,that's what mothers do I love being a
Man040_Woman045_0766,mother I love being your mother
Man040_Woman045_0767,Oh talk show up with Tyrone why do you
Man040_Woman045_0768,have no cards it nice to live on that
Man040_Woman045_0769,competitive questions what is the
Man040_Woman045_0770,mistake that I keep repeating what is
Man040_Woman045_0771,the mistake that I keep repeating not
Man040_Woman045_0772,reading your cards properly this is the
Man040_Woman045_0773,mistake that you keep repeating maybe
Man040_Woman045_0774,taking on more than you should
Man040_Woman045_0775,supposed to just focusing on a few
Man040_Woman045_0776,projects instead of doing all of them
Man040_Woman045_0777,and not capitalizing or using
Man040_Woman045_0778,punctuation and your text messages or
Man040_Woman045_0779,emails what is the secret that you have
Man040_Woman045_0780,been too afraid to tell me I did steal a
Man040_Woman045_0781,toy boat once at a drugstore in Montana
Man040_Woman045_0782,I was about six years old and I did feel
Man040_Woman045_0783,so guilty about it that about ten years
Man040_Woman045_0784,later when we were there again I paid
Man040_Woman045_0785,for it yeah but I've never really had
Man040_Woman045_0786,any major secrets cuz we always
Man040_Woman045_0787,discussed it yeah so I think that's a
Man040_Woman045_0788,really good thing yeah let's keep it
Man040_Woman045_0789,that way please
Man040_Woman045_0790,what was the moment you were proudest of
Man040_Woman045_0791,me was the moment that I was proudest of
Man040_Woman045_0792,you it happens often and so they kind of
Man040_Woman045_0793,I don't know it sounds terrible but it's
Man040_Woman045_0794,desensitized almost um I don't know when
Man040_Woman045_0795,you gave your TEDx talk when when you
Man040_Woman045_0796,when you win a stage on the bull run I
Man040_Woman045_0797,think that was actually that's probably
Man040_Woman045_0798,one of my most proud moments because
Man040_Woman045_0799,everybody was expecting me to get out of
Man040_Woman045_0800,the driver's seat but it was you having
Man040_Woman045_0801,crushed everyone else resembling yeah
Man040_Woman045_0802,you make me proud every day I'm really
Man040_Woman045_0803,lucky to have an awesome mother so I
