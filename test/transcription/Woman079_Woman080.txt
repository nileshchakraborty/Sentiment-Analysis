Woman079_Woman080_0044,she was already a bit above it I think
Woman079_Woman080_0045,the closest was I think's towards the
Woman079_Woman080_0046,end of senior year we were struggling a
Woman079_Woman080_0047,lot yeah not in terms of just like it's
Woman079_Woman080_0048,not more like personal lives
Woman079_Woman080_0049,yes but like at the same time making our
Woman079_Woman080_0050,art we felt very limited and very like
Woman079_Woman080_0051,you didn't have anyone else to talk to
Woman079_Woman080_0052,yeah we were feeling really down on the
Woman079_Woman080_0053,I remember I got really upset
Woman079_Woman080_0054,towards the end of senior year ago
Woman079_Woman080_0055,because I was just so frustrated with
Woman079_Woman080_0056,the work that I was doing and I felt
Woman079_Woman080_0057,like I couldn't really talk to a lot of
Woman079_Woman080_0058,professors and you being with studio
Woman079_Woman080_0059,neighbor a lot yeah yeah I think that
Woman079_Woman080_0060,time especially that time where I was

Woman079_Woman080_0062,once remember you're like yeah and I
Woman079_Woman080_0063,called later over that day I called my
Woman079_Woman080_0064,dad then I called you after that because

Woman079_Woman080_0066,but
Woman079_Woman080_0067,when I look in the mirror what do you
Woman079_Woman080_0068,think is the first thing I criticize
Woman079_Woman080_0069,[Applause]
Woman079_Woman080_0070,and when I do think are severe and when
Woman079_Woman080_0071,you look when you only turn when I hear
Woman079_Woman080_0072,that was the first thing that you
Woman079_Woman080_0073,criticize yes probably

Woman079_Woman080_0080,like in life a culture like these candy

Woman079_Woman080_0082,like we want to do point you have to
Woman079_Woman080_0083,maintain certain weight just because
Woman079_Woman080_0084,your feet your ankles can't support it
Woman079_Woman080_0085,versus the Imamate kind of thing and
Woman079_Woman080_0086,it's just like I guess like when I was
Woman079_Woman080_0087,younger I was like really chubby and
Woman079_Woman080_0088,just being surrounded by like super thin
Woman079_Woman080_0089,people it always influenced me deeply
Woman079_Woman080_0090,vertically I don't have to be harder on
Woman079_Woman080_0091,myself
Woman079_Woman080_0092,that's just one thing that a lot of
Woman079_Woman080_0093,girls go through yeah I mean like we're
Woman079_Woman080_0094,always like we're on different islands
Woman079_Woman080_0095,you know what's messed up it's the fact
Woman079_Woman080_0096,that you will criticize yourself but
Woman079_Woman080_0097,like if I were to precise myself

Woman079_Woman080_0299,also just like you know trying to figure
Woman079_Woman080_0300,out my life

Woman079_Woman080_0306,it's okay for me to ask do you feel like
Woman079_Woman080_0307,what you did for your performance piece
Woman079_Woman080_0308,it feels something like you like you
Woman079_Woman080_0309,know what I mean like because you always

Woman079_Woman080_0312,for you it wasn't it all sort of a
Woman079_Woman080_0313,comfort yet definitely it definitely

Woman079_Woman080_0317,really long time yeah it's a very
Woman079_Woman080_0318,important test and I think it it's like

Woman079_Woman080_0415,we're going to face a lot of hurdles and
Woman079_Woman080_0416,because of that expending I'm not going
Woman079_Woman080_0417,to try to feel appreciated and stuff but
Woman079_Woman080_0418,it's gonna make us stronger because
Woman079_Woman080_0419,going through all those things you learn
Woman079_Woman080_0420,from it topping to any other kid

Woman079_Woman080_0426,understanding
Woman079_Woman080_0427,and I mean because we have four
Woman079_Woman080_0428,different backgrounds and different
Woman079_Woman080_0429,beats they're all great there are going
Woman079_Woman080_0430,to be certain things right you're just
Woman079_Woman080_0431,going to be like oh that's what you
Woman079_Woman080_0432,believe in
Woman079_Woman080_0433,yeah but you don't you you don't like
Woman079_Woman080_0434,questioning you don't make fun you know
Woman079_Woman080_0435,and if you accept it so there's nothing
Woman079_Woman080_0436,you haven't know I think you're always
Woman079_Woman080_0437,up you always understand me no matter
Woman079_Woman080_0438,what even though even though you're
Woman079_Woman080_0439,unsure about it I don't know what do you
Woman079_Woman080_0440,what do you like yeah I don't like I

Woman079_Woman080_0452,just difference in they're not pretty
Woman079_Woman080_0453,because I think because the reason why
Woman079_Woman080_0454,you don't believe in too much I think
Woman079_Woman080_0455,it's because I'm just so open to you
Woman079_Woman080_0456,like it I'll tell you if I don't like
Woman079_Woman080_0457,something

Woman079_Woman080_0464,certain things that I people trill yeah
Woman079_Woman080_0465,I heard you incident or that I think
Woman079_Woman080_0466,that you just don't really yeah I think
Woman079_Woman080_0467,it's just cultural differences and even
Woman079_Woman080_0468,then we just don't question it because
Woman079_Woman080_0469,that's but like I accept you for who you

Woman079_Woman080_0475,clear being through me you know that
Woman079_Woman080_0476,doesn't even began and friends yeah it's
Woman079_Woman080_0477,like even though we do come from very
Woman079_Woman080_0478,different backgrounds but our parents
Woman079_Woman080_0479,taught us a lot as well in terms of we
Woman079_Woman080_0480,always like all of our talks get Saudia

Woman079_Woman080_0486,like you should like let's stop it yeah
Woman079_Woman080_0487,yeah we understand
Woman079_Woman080_0488,but what do you think is the most

Woman079_Woman080_0495,particular place in my life like be it
Woman079_Woman080_0496,like emotionally physically whatever is
Woman079_Woman080_0497,I think just like learning how to
Woman079_Woman080_0498,learning like learning how to handle my
Woman079_Woman080_0499,feelings in correspondence to that I
Woman079_Woman080_0500,think that's like it's difficult it's
Woman079_Woman080_0501,like really hard I think that's why I
Woman079_Woman080_0502,haven't like struggling on this past
Woman079_Woman080_0503,year but yeah
Woman079_Woman080_0504,learning how to live is like yeah that's
Woman079_Woman080_0505,right yeah II to like for me it's this
Woman079_Woman080_0506,idea that I don't have to deal with
Woman079_Woman080_0507,every single problem like I take so much
Woman079_Woman080_0508,I feel like there's always a lot of my
Woman079_Woman080_0509,feet yeah like oh I have to do this
Woman079_Woman080_0510,actually like I have to take care of
Woman079_Woman080_0511,this I have to be there for this person
Woman079_Woman080_0512,and I get taken for granted a lot yeah
Woman079_Woman080_0513,and upset sets in your life and I need
Woman079_Woman080_0514,to stop doing that I think that's what I
Woman079_Woman080_0515,kept for years
Woman079_Woman080_0516,oh yes we yeah we do the other person
Woman079_Woman080_0517,who did that
Woman079_Woman080_0518,I know we have a free education this is
Woman079_Woman080_0519,it's great personality know we had a
Woman079_Woman080_0520,great education but I think now you know
Woman079_Woman080_0521,what this it's being a person of color
Woman079_Woman080_0522,sometimes within institutions that yes
Woman079_Woman080_0523,it's hard because people always say oh
Woman079_Woman080_0524,why why are you always doing racing to
Woman079_Woman080_0525,everything or not this isn't sexist or
Woman079_Woman080_0526,this isn't you know what I'm game but
Woman079_Woman080_0527,it's like and I like you completely
Woman079_Woman080_0528,ignoring our struggles and it's like
Woman079_Woman080_0529,just because you bring up one issue
Woman079_Woman080_0530,doesn't mean that your time to negate
Woman079_Woman080_0531,anybody else's struggle or anything
Woman079_Woman080_0532,that's just like bringing awareness to
Woman079_Woman080_0533,something that has never like shadow
Woman079_Woman080_0534,right word and you think what in a
Woman079_Woman080_0535,college environment especially a
Woman079_Woman080_0536,progressive I mean there has been a lot
Woman079_Woman080_0537,of great professors they are students
Woman079_Woman080_0538,that you make but like it's not just a
Woman079_Woman080_0539,so idea huh it's especially being here
Woman079_Woman080_0540,in America you know mate
Woman079_Woman080_0541,yeah I obviously think about
Woman079_Woman080_0542,like I guess spirits are always scared
Woman079_Woman080_0543,for you it's just like the amount of
Woman079_Woman080_0544,hatred that is being this beautiful
Woman079_Woman080_0545,every direction it's like crazy in and
Woman079_Woman080_0546,yep it's just like your thoughts to like

Woman079_Woman080_0556,like I like what I struggle with is I'm
Woman079_Woman080_0557,so understanding with what people
Woman079_Woman080_0558,believe in but it's so hard for people
Woman079_Woman080_0559,to understand when I leave here that's a
Woman079_Woman080_0560,nice mess you up I see it all the time
Woman079_Woman080_0561,infinitely it makes me realize that like

Woman079_Woman080_0595,little fact that we ought to a stupid
Woman079_Woman080_0596,argument because I think I'd like some

Woman079_Woman080_0663,there that prospect I think you were she
Woman079_Woman080_0664,was like you know in the art world
Woman079_Woman080_0665,complete everybody is so like out for
Woman079_Woman080_0666,themselves anything
Woman079_Woman080_0667,as artists we need to make each other or
Woman079_Woman080_0668,each other we're not like I feel like
Woman079_Woman080_0669,that there are so many people in persons
Woman079_Woman080_0670,who just like don't get that you know
Woman079_Woman080_0671,now I don't think it's just I mean I'm
Woman079_Woman080_0672,going to say oh yeah we have argument I
Woman079_Woman080_0673,think in an art not specific to the
Woman079_Woman080_0674,school a lot of the times in an artist's
Woman079_Woman080_0675,like a park field or environment you're
Woman079_Woman080_0676,always like it's it's seen as
Woman079_Woman080_0677,competition
Woman079_Woman080_0678,yeah but in fact we should all be
Woman079_Woman080_0679,helping each other because like that's
Woman079_Woman080_0680,the whole basis of art you know what I
Woman079_Woman080_0681,mean is the fact that you're going
Woman079_Woman080_0682,against this this idea of like
Woman079_Woman080_0683,performing but you're there to make
Woman079_Woman080_0684,things happen you're there for change or
Woman079_Woman080_0685,they're too late meet art yeah maybe
