Man055_Woman060_0001,what are your three favorite memories
Man055_Woman060_0002,from our relationship one of my favorite
Man055_Woman060_0003,memories is when we went to we went
Man055_Woman060_0004,rollerblading which which time wait we
Man055_Woman060_0005,went rollerblading with see Amara and
Man055_Woman060_0006,then we came back to your house and we
Man055_Woman060_0007,eat the hot dogs yeah yeah could she eat
Man055_Woman060_0008,the hot dogs I think she could of dirt I
Man055_Woman060_0009,remember there was like a big issue of
Man055_Woman060_0010,her like not being able to eat hot dogs
Man055_Woman060_0011,and hunger my mom specifically made sure
Man055_Woman060_0012,that like she could eat them and she was
Man055_Woman060_0013,really happy and then her mom kept
Man055_Woman060_0014,calling her and then that add features I
Man055_Woman060_0015,really like add cages even though we
Man055_Woman060_0016,lost it was fun and I think like the
Man055_Woman060_0017,general for the third one is just having
Man055_Woman060_0018,the biology class yeah that was nice
Man055_Woman060_0019,I thought we bonded on Saturday I mean
Man055_Woman060_0020,that was like the first time we like I
Man055_Woman060_0021,actually started speaking to each other
Man055_Woman060_0022,and like actually because before that I
Man055_Woman060_0023,don't think we really spoke to each
Man055_Woman060_0024,other at all
Man055_Woman060_0025,like we didn't have a we were never in
Man055_Woman060_0026,the same room together like we didn't
Man055_Woman060_0027,have a class together so we didn't
Man055_Woman060_0028,really see each other that often
Man055_Woman060_0029,what do you remember about the first
Man055_Woman060_0030,time we met that's funny because we were
Man055_Woman060_0031,talking about that on the way here we
Man055_Woman060_0032,were in the biology class and I used to
Man055_Woman060_0033,think that you were really scary and I
Man055_Woman060_0034,was scared to talk to you because
Man055_Woman060_0035,everyone used to tell me that you were
Man055_Woman060_0036,not mean but like really intimidating
Man055_Woman060_0037,and you seemed really intimidating and
Man055_Woman060_0038,then I think I was sitting by myself at
Man055_Woman060_0039,one of the lab tables one day and I
Man055_Woman060_0040,think you showed up like a few minutes
Man055_Woman060_0041,late or you were sitting somewhere else
Man055_Woman060_0042,and then you'd like got your stuff and
Man055_Woman060_0043,asked if you could sit next to me and I
Man055_Woman060_0044,said okay because I was like too scared
Man055_Woman060_0045,to say no and I was like I don't want
Man055_Woman060_0046,you to not like me and then you were
Man055_Woman060_0047,really friendly and you would ask me
Man055_Woman060_0048,questions and try to get me to like talk
Man055_Woman060_0049,more like you would say something and be
Man055_Woman060_0050,like oh this is really cool or like I
Man055_Woman060_0051,like what you're wearing or something
Man055_Woman060_0052,like that and I felt more comfortable
Man055_Woman060_0053,talking to you and then we would see
Man055_Woman060_0054,each other every Saturday so it was it
Man055_Woman060_0055,was fun that's what I remember
Man055_Woman060_0056,what's the most ridiculous thing I've
Man055_Woman060_0057,done what did it teach you about me you
Man055_Woman060_0058,can be honest about this one if it's
Man055_Woman060_0059,really bad probably gonna have to need
Man055_Woman060_0060,some time to think about it
Man055_Woman060_0061,I feel like you could interpret
Man055_Woman060_0062,ridiculous in any way whether it was
Man055_Woman060_0063,like something that I probably shouldn't
Man055_Woman060_0064,have done it was a mistake that like
Man055_Woman060_0065,upset you or just something stupid I've
Man055_Woman060_0066,done and then what did it teach you
Man055_Woman060_0067,about me
Man055_Woman060_0068,I don't really know how to answer the
Man055_Woman060_0069,question because I can't think of
Man055_Woman060_0070,anything that you've done that's
Man055_Woman060_0071,ridiculous I feel like you think about a
Man055_Woman060_0072,lot of things before you do them so you
Man055_Woman060_0073,don't really go over things oh okay I
Man055_Woman060_0074,remember when junior year when we had us
Man055_Woman060_0075,together mm-hm and I used to sit next to
Man055_Woman060_0076,you and I always used to look at your
Man055_Woman060_0077,homework and you would write so much
Man055_Woman060_0078,that it wouldn't even fit in the margins
Man055_Woman060_0079,and I felt like that was like so much
Man055_Woman060_0080,work he didn't even read the question I
Man055_Woman060_0081,mean the answers so you writing so much
Man055_Woman060_0082,less like unnecessary in my opinion yeah
Man055_Woman060_0083,it was now that I think about it like he
Man055_Woman060_0084,really didn't read anything and I was
Man055_Woman060_0085,kind of just doing extra work for no
Man055_Woman060_0086,reason but I mean at least I learned
Man055_Woman060_0087,something kind of and then what did it
Man055_Woman060_0088,teach you about me you're an
Man055_Woman060_0089,overachiever with nobody did that
Man055_Woman060_0090,Brandon wrote outside of the margins for
Man055_Woman060_0091,a while then he told us that we were
Man055_Woman060_0092,stupid because we didn't know how to use
Man055_Woman060_0093,paper correctly do your best impression
Man055_Woman060_0094,of me both so I get yeah we both know
Man055_Woman060_0095,sir can I get up cause I feel like my
Man055_Woman060_0096,impression I don't
Man055_Woman060_0097,I don't really know I don't know I mean
Man055_Woman060_0098,like I was gonna dance but then I don't
Man055_Woman060_0099,want this to like get messed up okay
Man055_Woman060_0100,I'll try to like do my best while
Man055_Woman060_0101,sitting I'm gonna she's hard I'm trying
Man055_Woman060_0102,to think of something that would but you
Man055_Woman060_0103,would either say constantly I already
Man055_Woman060_0104,know when you make that face and you're
Man055_Woman060_0105,like you always make that face or like
Man055_Woman060_0106,when you say something that you know is
Man055_Woman060_0107,really funny or like you threw some
Man055_Woman060_0108,shade you're just like you just look at
Man055_Woman060_0109,each other and I already know what
Man055_Woman060_0110,you're thinking either that are just
Man055_Woman060_0111,dancing but I feel like your dance moves
Man055_Woman060_0112,would be really hard to replicate thank
Man055_Woman060_0113,you thank you I'll take that as a
Man055_Woman060_0114,compliment
Man055_Woman060_0115,my best impression of you I was thinking
Man055_Woman060_0116,while you were speaking so that I would
Man055_Woman060_0117,be able to do it right after but I guess
Man055_Woman060_0118,wasn't they can clip it off I feel like
Man055_Woman060_0119,you kind of like fixed your clothing
Man055_Woman060_0120,often I can't really fix it because like
Man055_Woman060_0121,you were a lot of highways and stuff and
Man055_Woman060_0122,I don't so I'm going to do that right
Man055_Woman060_0123,it's move my shirts up a little bit but
Man055_Woman060_0124,and you like you just said right now you
Man055_Woman060_0125,fix your glasses I also don't have
Man055_Woman060_0126,glasses so I can't do that but yeah they
Man055_Woman060_0127,are my glasses I'm trying to think of
Man055_Woman060_0128,like something that we say a lot you
Man055_Woman060_0129,always say like there it is it is and I
Man055_Woman060_0130,feel like I picked that up from you like
Man055_Woman060_0131,I say that sometimes or whenever someone
Man055_Woman060_0132,says something that's really frustrating
Man055_Woman060_0133,and like you don't want to argue at them
Man055_Woman060_0134,you'll just be like I understand I say
Man055_Woman060_0135,that all the time and I feel like some
Man055_Woman060_0136,people take it the wrong way and they
Man055_Woman060_0137,think that I'm trying to be rude but I'm
Man055_Woman060_0138,actually just saying that because I
Man055_Woman060_0139,don't want to get into an argument with
Man055_Woman060_0140,them but you said that so much that I
Man055_Woman060_0141,started saying it and I feel like see
Man055_Woman060_0142,you tomorrow says it sometimes too
Man055_Woman060_0143,what are you hesitant to tell me
Man055_Woman060_0144,probably gonna miss you a lot when I go
Man055_Woman060_0145,to college
Man055_Woman060_0146,I don't really tell people that I'm
Man055_Woman060_0147,gonna miss them because then it makes me
Man055_Woman060_0148,think about it and then like I get sad
Man055_Woman060_0149,and I don't want to get sad but I feel
Man055_Woman060_0150,like we've been through a lot together
Man055_Woman060_0151,and we've known you even though I didn't
Man055_Woman060_0152,really know you that much freshman year
Man055_Woman060_0153,since sophomore year like you you know
Man055_Woman060_0154,we've been through a lot and I'm gonna
Man055_Woman060_0155,miss that yeah I'm gonna answer that one
Man055_Woman060_0156,too
Man055_Woman060_0157,I think and although I feel like we've
Man055_Woman060_0158,moved past this and I don't want to like
Man055_Woman060_0159,like bring anything up or just like
Man055_Woman060_0160,cause unnecessary issues I just feel
Man055_Woman060_0161,like we never really had a conversation
Man055_Woman060_0162,about like the time period especially
Man055_Woman060_0163,like this year where we kind of just
Man055_Woman060_0164,like didn't talk to each other anymore
Man055_Woman060_0165,we like drifted apart and because there
Man055_Woman060_0166,was never really a conversation because
Man055_Woman060_0167,we're both like very passive-aggressive
Man055_Woman060_0168,when we we'll know that something's
Man055_Woman060_0169,bothering the other person and then we
Man055_Woman060_0170,just won't say anything because we're
Man055_Woman060_0171,too upset and we don't want to talk to
Man055_Woman060_0172,anyone or just like we don't want to
Man055_Woman060_0173,hurt the other person's feelings but it
Man055_Woman060_0174,gets to a point where I feel like we go
Man055_Woman060_0175,so long without talking to each other
Man055_Woman060_0176,that like at like at a certain point
Man055_Woman060_0177,like even a few months ago I wondered if
Man055_Woman060_0178,we were even going to talk to each other
Man055_Woman060_0179,anymore
Man055_Woman060_0180,or like if you didn't want to talk to me
Man055_Woman060_0181,if you didn't like me anymore because I
Man055_Woman060_0182,still spoke to Xiomara and that was fine
Man055_Woman060_0183,but then it's like I really because I
Man055_Woman060_0184,didn't I don't speak to like a group of
Man055_Woman060_0185,people anymore and like you speak to
Man055_Woman060_0186,that group of people I was just
Man055_Woman060_0187,wondering if like it would be too
Man055_Woman060_0188,difficult to maintain a friendship or
Man055_Woman060_0189,any kind of relationship like I don't
Man055_Woman060_0190,know I think I that's what I'd be
Man055_Woman060_0191,hesitant to tell you that like that
Man055_Woman060_0192,worried me and that scared me a lot and
Man055_Woman060_0193,I thought I honestly thought that we
Man055_Woman060_0194,weren't like we probably wouldn't even
Man055_Woman060_0195,be here right now if we wouldn't be
Man055_Woman060_0196,talking to each other yeah I don't know
Man055_Woman060_0197,I feel like that was a conversation that
Man055_Woman060_0198,was never had and
Man055_Woman060_0199,yeah I don't know I don't feel like
Man055_Woman060_0200,raise that I feel like through these
Man055_Woman060_0201,questions we're probably gonna talk
Man055_Woman060_0202,about it but I want you to know that
Man055_Woman060_0203,even when I'm friends with a group of
Man055_Woman060_0204,people like I will never let one
Man055_Woman060_0205,friendship well it'll probably affect
Man055_Woman060_0206,another friendship but I wouldn't
Man055_Woman060_0207,terminate a friendship based on what
Man055_Woman060_0208,somebody else thinks because I'm only
Man055_Woman060_0209,really friends with one of the people in
Man055_Woman060_0210,the group now yeah I thought that that I
Man055_Woman060_0211,don't want to say their names when I'm
Man055_Woman060_0212,scared they're gonna watch this
Man055_Woman060_0213,I don't like come after me but um like
Man055_Woman060_0214,that's it's really weird because like
Man055_Woman060_0215,that's the what I don't understand about
Man055_Woman060_0216,the whole situation is that like that's
Man055_Woman060_0217,why I stopped speaking to them because
Man055_Woman060_0218,we were friends and they didn't approve
Man055_Woman060_0219,of it and like I don't need someone's
Man055_Woman060_0220,permission to be someone's friend like
Man055_Woman060_0221,and I feel like just talking about this
Man055_Woman060_0222,in the way that I'm explaining this it
Man055_Woman060_0223,sounds so childish because it is
Man055_Woman060_0224,childish yeah I don't need to explain
Man055_Woman060_0225,why I like being around certain people
Man055_Woman060_0226,or why I do the things that I do or why
Man055_Woman060_0227,I feel the way that I do and I was going
Man055_Woman060_0228,through a lot at the time and I always
Man055_Woman060_0229,felt like I couldn't speak to them about
Man055_Woman060_0230,how I was genuinely feeling and that
Man055_Woman060_0231,kind of told me that if I can't be
Man055_Woman060_0232,honest with them then like we should the
Man055_Woman060_0233,relationship isn't gonna go anywhere and
Man055_Woman060_0234,it's not doing anyone any good but like
Man055_Woman060_0235,then I because like we weren't talking
Man055_Woman060_0236,either and I don't
Man055_Woman060_0237,again like I don't really think we ever
Man055_Woman060_0238,like nothing really happened we just
Man055_Woman060_0239,kind of stopped speaking to each other I
Man055_Woman060_0240,always thought it was really weird
Man055_Woman060_0241,because the reason I stopped speaking to
Man055_Woman060_0242,that group of people was because like
Man055_Woman060_0243,they weren't okay with us being friends
Man055_Woman060_0244,and then the exact opposite of what I
Man055_Woman060_0245,expected to happen happened but I'm glad
Man055_Woman060_0246,that like things are okay now but that
Man055_Woman060_0247,was always like a big question for me
Man055_Woman060_0248,because I even spoke to like Miss
Man055_Woman060_0249,Herrera about it I didn't understand how
Man055_Woman060_0250,that happened I mean in my mind I just
Man055_Woman060_0251,thought that the same way that I saw
Man055_Woman060_0252,like good in you even though everyone
Man055_Woman060_0253,told me that like not to befriend you
Man055_Woman060_0254,were like not to talk to you that you
Man055_Woman060_0255,were like real
Man055_Woman060_0256,me and like really insensitive that's
Man055_Woman060_0257,not the experience that I've ever had
Man055_Woman060_0258,with you and like I don't people people
Man055_Woman060_0259,would say things like that and I'm sure
Man055_Woman060_0260,people have said that those kinds of
Man055_Woman060_0261,things about me because people say stuff
Man055_Woman060_0262,about everyone but that wasn't the
Man055_Woman060_0263,experience I had with you and I didn't I
Man055_Woman060_0264,chose not to like listen to those people
Man055_Woman060_0265,so I thought it was really strange that
Man055_Woman060_0266,that happened that worked out the way it
Man055_Woman060_0267,did yes I realized that like after
Man055_Woman060_0268,spending like a couple of hours in one
Man055_Woman060_0269,day with them that a lot of them are
Man055_Woman060_0270,really judgmental and I didn't think
Man055_Woman060_0271,that so I only really talked to one of
Man055_Woman060_0272,them now and I guess I would speak to
Man055_Woman060_0273,the other ones while I'm with that other
Man055_Woman060_0274,person that you know who I'm talking
Man055_Woman060_0275,about but I don't really I only really
Man055_Woman060_0276,hang out with one of them not the person
Man055_Woman060_0277,but you know another person the one that
Man055_Woman060_0278,smiles all the time I'd hang out with
Man055_Woman060_0279,her because I like her yeah like her
Man055_Woman060_0280,personality I don't I don't dislike any
Man055_Woman060_0281,of them and I feel like it would be easy
Man055_Woman060_0282,like I don't it's not that I think about
Man055_Woman060_0283,this all the time but I think about it
Man055_Woman060_0284,from time to time and I wonder if like I
Man055_Woman060_0285,know that I've like it was part of the
Man055_Woman060_0286,relationship not working was kind of my
Man055_Woman060_0287,fault because I didn't communicate and
Man055_Woman060_0288,when I get really upset I just kind of
Man055_Woman060_0289,like retreat and they just like
Man055_Woman060_0290,hibernate and like don't want to talk to
Man055_Woman060_0291,anyone because I'm really upset and I
Man055_Woman060_0292,need to like work through it myself so I
Man055_Woman060_0293,feel like had there been more
Man055_Woman060_0294,communication or had I tried to maybe
Man055_Woman060_0295,like help those people understand that
Man055_Woman060_0296,being so judgmental I like talking about
Man055_Woman060_0297,someone else really doesn't make you
Man055_Woman060_0298,that much better so there's no point in
Man055_Woman060_0299,doing it I would like to think that that
Man055_Woman060_0300,would work but I feel like in terms of
Man055_Woman060_0301,maturity maybe right now that wouldn't
Man055_Woman060_0302,have worked so I don't regret the
Man055_Woman060_0303,decision I made I just feel like I
Man055_Woman060_0304,definitely made mistakes and like we've
Man055_Woman060_0305,all made mistakes but you just kind of
Man055_Woman060_0306,have to move past it but I mean I don't
Man055_Woman060_0307,I don't dislike any of them and I hope
Man055_Woman060_0308,that everything works out for them and
Man055_Woman060_0309,whatever it is they wanted achieve in
Man055_Woman060_0310,life it would be easier if I didn't and
Man055_Woman060_0311,you know if I could just like cast
Man055_Woman060_0312,everyone out of my yeah but like they've
Man055_Woman060_0313,been a part of your they'd been a part
Man055_Woman060_0314,of our lives for like so many years so
Man055_Woman060_0315,you can't just pretend like they don't
Man055_Woman060_0316,this when do you peel closest to me I
Man055_Woman060_0317,think well I would say like right now I
Man055_Woman060_0318,like any time where we actually talk
Man055_Woman060_0319,about how we're feeling because we don't
Man055_Woman060_0320,do that that often I think yeah I like
Man055_Woman060_0321,all right I like he tried I have like
Man055_Woman060_0322,when we talk about how we're feeling and
Man055_Woman060_0323,we're honest about that just because it
Man055_Woman060_0324,answers a lot of questions that I have
Man055_Woman060_0325,or it'll answer a lot of questions that
Man055_Woman060_0326,you have because even though I think we
Man055_Woman060_0327,can tell pretty well like what the other
Man055_Woman060_0328,person is feeling
Man055_Woman060_0329,sometimes you can't and that helps and
Man055_Woman060_0330,all of this isn't really part of the
Man055_Woman060_0331,question I think I also felt really like
Man055_Woman060_0332,if I had to pick like a moment in all
Man055_Woman060_0333,the years that we have been friends
Man055_Woman060_0334,where like I really felt close to I
Man055_Woman060_0335,would probably say like graduation day
Man055_Woman060_0336,when your mom came up to me after I gave
Man055_Woman060_0337,my speech and was like crying and
Man055_Woman060_0338,telling me that she had been through the
Man055_Woman060_0339,same kinds of things that I spoke about
Man055_Woman060_0340,with like mental illness and just having
Man055_Woman060_0341,anxiety and like not taking care of
Man055_Woman060_0342,yourself and learning but that's a thing
Man055_Woman060_0343,that you should do and then it's not
Man055_Woman060_0344,selfish to take care of yourself I think
Man055_Woman060_0345,because I you know I didn't know that
Man055_Woman060_0346,about her and for her to tell me that
Man055_Woman060_0347,she's been through the same thing or
Man055_Woman060_0348,similar made me feel closer to you as a
Man055_Woman060_0349,friend and I feel like that's something
Man055_Woman060_0350,that has brought us closer even though
Man055_Woman060_0351,we don't really talk about it that much
Man055_Woman060_0352,I just I think about it a lot and I'm
Man055_Woman060_0353,glad that one I'm not alone into that
Man055_Woman060_0354,someone else has been able to kind of
Man055_Woman060_0355,learn to cope with things like that so I
Man055_Woman060_0356,know that if we ever have issues like
Man055_Woman060_0357,that we'll be okay I feel like the
Man055_Woman060_0358,closest that I felt to you was on
Man055_Woman060_0359,graduation but not obviously when you
Man055_Woman060_0360,met my mom because I wasn't there
Man055_Woman060_0361,it was when look like we were in the
Man055_Woman060_0362,front of the school and not not like the
Man055_Woman060_0363,front like on the fourth floor yeah like
Man055_Woman060_0364,I was crying and I was like sorry for
Man055_Woman060_0365,being a bitch because I'm really
Man055_Woman060_0366,dramatic
Man055_Woman060_0367,and yeah and when we hugged I feel like
Man055_Woman060_0368,we're really close yeah yeah I remember
Man055_Woman060_0369,that if you could go back and change
Man055_Woman060_0370,anything from our past what would it be
Man055_Woman060_0371,and why I feel like I would probably go
Man055_Woman060_0372,back to like I don't know if it was the
Man055_Woman060_0373,first semester towards the end or the
Man055_Woman060_0374,second one in the beginning but in ve I
Man055_Woman060_0375,feel like that's when we kind of stopped
Man055_Woman060_0376,talking because we kept clashing and
Man055_Woman060_0377,neither of us I knew that you didn't
Man055_Woman060_0378,want to argue and I didn't want to argue
Man055_Woman060_0379,either so instead we just didn't say
Man055_Woman060_0380,anything saying it yeah so we didn't
Man055_Woman060_0381,speak for like two or three months that
Man055_Woman060_0382,was ridiculous yeah I think I would
Man055_Woman060_0383,change that too I was going to say that
Man055_Woman060_0384,like I don't think I would change
Man055_Woman060_0385,anything because we've learned from it
Man055_Woman060_0386,but that is true I still think that for
Man055_Woman060_0387,the sake of answering the question if I
Man055_Woman060_0388,did have to change something I would not
Man055_Woman060_0389,necessarily change and like eliminate
Man055_Woman060_0390,that entire like issue because I think
Man055_Woman060_0391,like we did learn something valuable
Man055_Woman060_0392,from it but change I guess the way that
Man055_Woman060_0393,we dealt with it and I would hopefully
Man055_Woman060_0394,if we were to redo that or somehow
Man055_Woman060_0395,experience that again like be better at
Man055_Woman060_0396,communicating and knowing that the other
Man055_Woman060_0397,person doesn't want to argue and that we
Man055_Woman060_0398,just need to talk about it but I think
Man055_Woman060_0399,and this is something that again like I
Man055_Woman060_0400,clashed a lot on with like that other
Man055_Woman060_0401,group of people is that we were both so
Man055_Woman060_0402,passionate about that and we wanted not
Man055_Woman060_0403,only ourselves but like the entire class
Man055_Woman060_0404,to have a really good time and enjoy
Man055_Woman060_0405,everything that they were doing or like
Man055_Woman060_0406,get something meaningful out of the
Man055_Woman060_0407,experience that we would take it really
Man055_Woman060_0408,personally and we would take a lot of
Man055_Woman060_0409,that stuff home with us even though it
Man055_Woman060_0410,should have just stayed there but at the
Man055_Woman060_0411,end of the day I don't think that
Man055_Woman060_0412,anything we did was ever like out of
Man055_Woman060_0413,spite or like being like purposefully
Man055_Woman060_0414,hurtful I think we were just both really
Man055_Woman060_0415,invested in and really passionate about
Man055_Woman060_0416,what we were doing and we just cared too
Man055_Woman060_0417,much if that makes any sense
Man055_Woman060_0418,yeah it does what can I do to improve
Man055_Woman060_0419,our relationship like all these
Man055_Woman060_0420,questions I would say just telling you
Man055_Woman060_0421,how you feel more and I feel like I have
Man055_Woman060_0422,to work on that too
Man055_Woman060_0423,but I'm worried now that we're going to
Man055_Woman060_0424,different schools not just you and me
Man055_Woman060_0425,but you me and Xiomara that despite
Man055_Woman060_0426,everything we've been through and like
Man055_Woman060_0427,we always find our way back there's
Man055_Woman060_0428,still a part of me that worries that
Man055_Woman060_0429,even if we like keep in contact or we'll
Man055_Woman060_0430,like text each other there gonna be days
Man055_Woman060_0431,where we can't talk to each other
Man055_Woman060_0432,because we're really busy or we're gonna
Man055_Woman060_0433,make new friends and we're gonna talk to
Man055_Woman060_0434,new people which is great and that's
Man055_Woman060_0435,fine but I'm like constantly worried
Man055_Woman060_0436,that as the time passes war because
Man055_Woman060_0437,we're experiencing different things
Man055_Woman060_0438,we'll just be different people and we
Man055_Woman060_0439,won't be in that same kind of mindset
Man055_Woman060_0440,right because we're like experiencing
Man055_Woman060_0441,different things and we're not together
Man055_Woman060_0442,all the time all right so I think that
Man055_Woman060_0443,with that being said just being able to
Man055_Woman060_0444,like talk about how we feel or like if
Man055_Woman060_0445,something stressing you out even if it
Man055_Woman060_0446,does like we don't have to have like
Man055_Woman060_0447,super emotional conversations all the
Man055_Woman060_0448,time just like if something stressed you
Man055_Woman060_0449,out that day or like something bother do
Man055_Woman060_0450,you like we can just talk about it or
Man055_Woman060_0451,like if something bothered me we can
Man055_Woman060_0452,talk about it and like not feel not
Man055_Woman060_0453,guilty is not the word I want to use but
Man055_Woman060_0454,like not feel like we're intruding or
Man055_Woman060_0455,like being too overly sensitive or
Man055_Woman060_0456,anything like that because I don't mind
Man055_Woman060_0457,talking about how you feel or if
Man055_Woman060_0458,something's really bothering you
Man055_Woman060_0459,like I think last summer or the summer
Man055_Woman060_0460,before you were talking to me about like
Man055_Woman060_0461,all the stuff going on with your dad and
Man055_Woman060_0462,like his house and I remember you called
Man055_Woman060_0463,me and you were riding a bike and then I
Man055_Woman060_0464,think I heard him on the other line of
Man055_Woman060_0465,the phone asking why you weren't wearing
Man055_Woman060_0466,when you're riding your bike and then
Man055_Woman060_0467,you immediately hung up and like called
Man055_Woman060_0468,me or texted me a few hours later but I
Man055_Woman060_0469,remember that that was really stressful
Man055_Woman060_0470,for you so I was glad that you felt
Man055_Woman060_0471,comfortable enough to talk to me about
Man055_Woman060_0472,it but just more things like that I
Man055_Woman060_0473,think would be great if you want to
Man055_Woman060_0474,answer that back you can as well if you
Man055_Woman060_0475,think I need to work on anything because
Man055_Woman060_0476,it definitely do I also think it's
Man055_Woman060_0477,communication but I think it's not to
Man055_Woman060_0478,say like it's all it's not you it's me
Man055_Woman060_0479,but like I think my biggest problem
Man055_Woman060_0480,which is super ironic because I talk a
Man055_Woman060_0481,lot is communication because I'll talk a
Man055_Woman060_0482,lot about things that don't really
Man055_Woman060_0483,matter or not necessarily don't matter
Man055_Woman060_0484,but aren't of the most importance but I
Man055_Woman060_0485,usually I'm usually dissuaded to talk
Man055_Woman060_0486,about things that need to be talked
Man055_Woman060_0487,about because I know sometimes I can
Man055_Woman060_0488,really like facing reality yeah so I
Man055_Woman060_0489,think I get that yeah
Man055_Woman060_0490,what's one lesson you really want me to
Man055_Woman060_0491,learn these are they're really
Man055_Woman060_0492,thoughtful questions one lesson I really
Man055_Woman060_0493,want you to learn
Man055_Woman060_0494,I feel like you're a very charismatic
Man055_Woman060_0495,person and because you're really
Man055_Woman060_0496,charismatic sometimes you're blinded by
Man055_Woman060_0497,some of your actions and it can come off
Man055_Woman060_0498,like a little bit selfish and not not
Man055_Woman060_0499,like not the things where you go home
Man055_Woman060_0500,and you study like that's not selfish
Man055_Woman060_0501,you just care about your grades but
Man055_Woman060_0502,sometimes you do things and of course
Man055_Woman060_0503,when all when you bring up a problem you
Man055_Woman060_0504,never have an example to back it but
Man055_Woman060_0505,sometimes when you do things you don't
Man055_Woman060_0506,realize like how it might be perceived
Man055_Woman060_0507,as a little bit selfish do you mean like
Man055_Woman060_0508,I know you said you don't have an
Man055_Woman060_0509,example but what do you like do you mean
Man055_Woman060_0510,like a personal problem or like
Man055_Woman060_0511,something that I'm not talking about
Man055_Woman060_0512,like I guess sometimes when you talk not
Man055_Woman060_0513,recently
Man055_Woman060_0514,ever since graduation it's been like
Man055_Woman060_0515,really good but before like before we
Man055_Woman060_0516,had the thing that we stopped talking
Man055_Woman060_0517,and the I feel like sometimes when you
Man055_Woman060_0518,talk you don't realize how much you're
Man055_Woman060_0519,talking about yourself I kind of got a
Man055_Woman060_0520,little bit annoying I used to I know I
Man055_Woman060_0521,get what you mean I've been trying to
Man055_Woman060_0522,not do that because I realized that
Man055_Woman060_0523,although I would like I don't know I
Man055_Woman060_0524,just really I did get a no I was getting
Man055_Woman060_0525,annoyed at myself because even though I
Man055_Woman060_0526,wasn't trying to be selfish or like like
Man055_Woman060_0527,I don't like show up like I wasn't
Man055_Woman060_0528,trying to like prove a point or anything
Man055_Woman060_0529,I think I'm just the type of person that
Man055_Woman060_0530,I it's not that I don't like awkward
Man055_Woman060_0531,silences or just like silence but I feel
Man055_Woman060_0532,the need to just keep talking if no one
Man055_Woman060_0533,else is talking if I'm comfortable with
Man055_Woman060_0534,that person if I'm not then I probably
Man055_Woman060_0535,won't say anything but if I'm around
Man055_Woman060_0536,people that I feel comfortable I just
Man055_Woman060_0537,keep talking but I've learned to control
Man055_Woman060_0538,that and not do it as much because it
Man055_Woman060_0539,was annoying today I asked that question
Man055_Woman060_0540,or did you know I asked my questions as
Man055_Woman060_0541,your Jenny I'm gonna actually pick this
Man055_Woman060_0542,one because it keeps falling
Man055_Woman060_0543,tell me about the time I disappointed
Man055_Woman060_0544,you and how do you feel about it now
Man055_Woman060_0545,literally all using the same I just
Man055_Woman060_0546,think I've been trying to think of like
Man055_Woman060_0547,a specific time because I don't feel
Man055_Woman060_0548,like like in general I don't think
Man055_Woman060_0549,you've disappointed me actually yeah I
Man055_Woman060_0550,think I can pick something I don't to be
Man055_Woman060_0551,honest like that and this just shows
Man055_Woman060_0552,like how unimportant this this is or
Man055_Woman060_0553,like why I don't understand why we made
Man055_Woman060_0554,it such a big deal before but it was
Man055_Woman060_0555,when we were having I remember it was a
Man055_Woman060_0556,day we went to a practice for the
Man055_Woman060_0557,business plan over Christmas break and
Man055_Woman060_0558,it was just like you me a few other
Man055_Woman060_0559,people like a tool I think cane I showed
Man055_Woman060_0560,up to and miss maroney's like pulled
Man055_Woman060_0561,each of us individually to speak to us
Man055_Woman060_0562,and then I think I saw you like outside
Man055_Woman060_0563,in the hallway like talking to Jessica
Man055_Woman060_0564,and I didn't know what you were saying
Man055_Woman060_0565,what she kept like looking back in the
Man055_Woman060_0566,room so of course like I got paranoid
Man055_Woman060_0567,and I thought you were saying something
Man055_Woman060_0568,about me and my feelings were hurt
Man055_Woman060_0569,because I didn't understand like why we
Man055_Woman060_0570,weren't speaking to each other but I
Man055_Woman060_0571,think I was disappointed because I
Man055_Woman060_0572,remember mr. Ronis saying something
Man055_Woman060_0573,about how she could understand why we
Man055_Woman060_0574,were both upset and that we both had
Man055_Woman060_0575,valid reasons to be upset and again
Man055_Woman060_0576,because we hadn't spoken to each other I
Man055_Woman060_0577,was disappointed because I did like I
Man055_Woman060_0578,genuinely I was like did I do something
Man055_Woman060_0579,wrong did I say something wrong like did
Man055_Woman060_0580,I offend you did I hurt your feelings I
Man055_Woman060_0581,don't understand why like you're being
Man055_Woman060_0582,so like bitch offensive so like
Man055_Woman060_0583,defensive um but I think I was
Man055_Woman060_0584,disappointed with that because I had
Man055_Woman060_0585,never like we had never we had had like
Man055_Woman060_0586,little arguments before but it had never
Man055_Woman060_0587,been that bad to the point where like we
Man055_Woman060_0588,hadn't spoken to each other and we're
Man055_Woman060_0589,just putting it off for as long as we
Man055_Woman060_0590,could and then to make matters worse
Man055_Woman060_0591,when I that was when I was still
Man055_Woman060_0592,speaking to certain people and
Man055_Woman060_0593,they just like added more fuel to the
Man055_Woman060_0594,fire and they were like oh we told you
Man055_Woman060_0595,like don't this is why you don't speak
Man055_Woman060_0596,to people like that blah blah blah and I
Man055_Woman060_0597,didn't get not to say that I got like
Man055_Woman060_0598,swept away in it but because I was upset
Man055_Woman060_0599,like yeah yeah but it's not important
Man055_Woman060_0600,and like I don't even think about that
Man055_Woman060_0601,anymore
Man055_Woman060_0602,I kind of feel like and I don't really
Man055_Woman060_0603,care if they watch this but I kinda feel
Man055_Woman060_0604,like they're like a cesspool of snakes
Man055_Woman060_0605,yeah it continues but like because I
Man055_Woman060_0606,know her a lot more I don't really
Man055_Woman060_0607,consider her as a snake yeah I know I'm
Man055_Woman060_0608,talking about that's the one person that
Man055_Woman060_0609,person and then like the smiley mmm well
Man055_Woman060_0610,I would say that person and then the
Man055_Woman060_0611,person that I don't want to talk in
Man055_Woman060_0612,Cohen I'm scared to say their names okay
Man055_Woman060_0613,okay cool oh so this is this makes
Man055_Woman060_0614,things a lot easier
Man055_Woman060_0615,um like I never had a problem with Julia
Man055_Woman060_0616,Julia is fine but like I'll say I felt
Man055_Woman060_0617,like I would stab even when we would be
Man055_Woman060_0618,in like miss maroney's room I would
Man055_Woman060_0619,still talk to her like we'd have
Man055_Woman060_0620,conversations but we've had a
Man055_Woman060_0621,conversation about like what has
Man055_Woman060_0622,happened in terms of us like not being
Man055_Woman060_0623,friends anymore and we've both agreed to
Man055_Woman060_0624,like be at a point where we can speak to
Man055_Woman060_0625,each other if we see each other but like
Man055_Woman060_0626,we're not necessarily the best of
Man055_Woman060_0627,friends and I'm okay with that and like
Man055_Woman060_0628,I respect that about her and like I'm
Man055_Woman060_0629,fine with Julianne I would be fine like
Man055_Woman060_0630,talking to Christopher those were like
Man055_Woman060_0631,probably the only three that I would
Man055_Woman060_0632,really talk to Melissa she's a good
Man055_Woman060_0633,person and I can tell she just has
Man055_Woman060_0634,trouble expressing her emotions and my
Man055_Woman060_0635,experience with her has been that she
Man055_Woman060_0636,like a lot of the time then she would
Man055_Woman060_0637,get frustrated it would just be like
Man055_Woman060_0638,this outburst and I didn't know how to
Man055_Woman060_0639,deal with that so I just felt like I
Man055_Woman060_0640,wasn't doing anything good time being
Man055_Woman060_0641,her friend so you know and like that
Man055_Woman060_0642,whole relationship was just affecting me
Man055_Woman060_0643,really negatively I was just like not
Man055_Woman060_0644,talking to my dad at the time and like
Man055_Woman060_0645,really stressed out
Man055_Woman060_0646,so I just
Man055_Woman060_0647,we didn't handle it anymore um for Napa
Man055_Woman060_0648,Valley but yeah the other person and
Man055_Woman060_0649,since we can say their names and they'll
Man055_Woman060_0650,get caught out this will be great I
Man055_Woman060_0651,really like even though I don't hate
Man055_Woman060_0652,Molina okay like don't look so scared to
Man055_Woman060_0653,say her name you and I don't dislike her
Man055_Woman060_0654,I just feel like she's just a very
Man055_Woman060_0655,negative person and I don't want to be
Man055_Woman060_0656,around that and she was like the main
Man055_Woman060_0657,reason why I always felt like I couldn't
Man055_Woman060_0658,voice my opinion and I like I what like
Man055_Woman060_0659,literally drove me insane was that she
Man055_Woman060_0660,would literally talk so much shit about
Man055_Woman060_0661,you and like constantly tell me things
Man055_Woman060_0662,about like how you were horrible and how
Man055_Woman060_0663,like someone said this and this and this
Man055_Woman060_0664,about you and this is so childish and I
Man055_Woman060_0665,can't believe or even like wasting time
Man055_Woman060_0666,talking about this but then like as soon
Man055_Woman060_0667,as I stopped talking for them I don't
Man055_Woman060_0668,know like it was purposeful but then
Man055_Woman060_0669,like everyone started being a friend and
Man055_Woman060_0670,like being all buddy-buddy with you and
Man055_Woman060_0671,I was just like I know you don't like
Man055_Woman060_0672,that person so why are you doing that I
Man055_Woman060_0673,feel like the only well not the only
Man055_Woman060_0674,people but the people that I really
Man055_Woman060_0675,liked the most in the group where you
Man055_Woman060_0676,know the person that I kept referring to
Man055_Woman060_0677,the entire time and they're like Julian
Man055_Woman060_0678,because I feel like you're gonna block
Man055_Woman060_0679,that okay okay just block all those
Man055_Woman060_0680,people's names I feel like I like him
Man055_Woman060_0681,because he's really like sincere and
Man055_Woman060_0682,yeah genuine and I feel like he doesn't
Man055_Woman060_0683,really have a need to lie so he doesn't
Man055_Woman060_0684,lie and I don't like that but yeah I'd
Man055_Woman060_0685,rather I feel bad about Julian because I
Man055_Woman060_0686,remember when I spoke to Julia she told
Man055_Woman060_0687,me that he was really hurt that I kind
Man055_Woman060_0688,of just stopped talking to everyone and
Man055_Woman060_0689,like I think that's when I was referring
Man055_Woman060_0690,to like mistakes that's like the biggest
Man055_Woman060_0691,thing that I regret is that I
Man055_Woman060_0692,unintentionally hurt someone's feelings
Man055_Woman060_0693,because I really the only reason I
Man055_Woman060_0694,stopped speaking to the entire group is
Man055_Woman060_0695,because I knew that like milena would
Man055_Woman060_0696,just tell everyone like not to talk to
Man055_Woman060_0697,me and that I was horrible because like
Man055_Woman060_0698,that those few months after I like
Man055_Woman060_0699,really cut off all ties with them were
Man055_Woman060_0700,awful like I remember speaking to like
Man055_Woman060_0701,Christopher and even like Julia and they
Man055_Woman060_0702,literally would just like there was like
Man055_Woman060_0703,one day where they both like kind of
Man055_Woman060_0704,like tag-teamed on me and just like
Man055_Woman060_0705,competed li sent me tech
Man055_Woman060_0706,just telling me like what an awful
Man055_Woman060_0707,person I was Christopher specifically
Man055_Woman060_0708,and it's just like I don't understand
Man055_Woman060_0709,why despite what the issue was like why
Man055_Woman060_0710,that was necessary and that just
Man055_Woman060_0711,reflects that like you're not a very
Man055_Woman060_0712,mature person but I feel bad about like
Man055_Woman060_0713,not being able to like tell Julian that
Man055_Woman060_0714,I I'm sorry about that and maybe I will
Man055_Woman060_0715,after this because I feel like I should
Man055_Woman060_0716,and I owe him an explanation but I'd
Man055_Woman060_0717,like I just feel weird about it because
Man055_Woman060_0718,I don't want to bring up stuff that like
Man055_Woman060_0719,people have already forgotten about it
Man055_Woman060_0720,moved on from yeah I I also feel like
Man055_Woman060_0721,like we know the the main person that
Man055_Woman060_0722,typically poisons took like the whole
Man055_Woman060_0723,clique but I feel like with the person
Man055_Woman060_0724,that we feel closes - well not close to
Man055_Woman060_0725,sue but the person you were just
Man055_Woman060_0726,referring to like he's gotten really
Man055_Woman060_0727,close with a certain someone that has a
Man055_Woman060_0728,boyfriend not in the group are you
Man055_Woman060_0729,talking about they're gonna they're
Man055_Woman060_0730,gonna bleep this out I understand you
Man055_Woman060_0731,can you take out the boyfriend part to
Man055_Woman060_0732,throwing major shade okay okay so I'm
Man055_Woman060_0733,just gonna say the names up that's okay
Man055_Woman060_0734,that's cool okay so I feel like I feel
Man055_Woman060_0735,like Julia and Julian got really close
Man055_Woman060_0736,yeah I don't know where that and I feel
Man055_Woman060_0737,like well so Julia told Melissa that
Man055_Woman060_0738,Julia's finds me and she likes me and
Man055_Woman060_0739,everything but I kind of feel like
Man055_Woman060_0740,that's a lie like she actually doesn't
Man055_Woman060_0741,like me and I don't understand why
Man055_Woman060_0742,they're so close because I feel like
Man055_Woman060_0743,Julia talks about Julian to Melissa but
Man055_Woman060_0744,then you're really close to him so like
Man055_Woman060_0745,what is the truth like insert the open
Man055_Woman060_0746,the Oprah gift what is the truth I don't
Man055_Woman060_0747,know yeah I noticed that it like gelas
Man055_Woman060_0748,party like I will here's the thing I'm
Man055_Woman060_0749,really bad at like if I'm focusing on
Man055_Woman060_0750,one thing I don't pay attention to
Man055_Woman060_0751,anything else but Michelle told me about
Man055_Woman060_0752,that and then when she pointed out I was
Man055_Woman060_0753,like huh yeah I did notice that they
Man055_Woman060_0754,were like together the end
Man055_Woman060_0755,time and I didn't that was weird like I
Man055_Woman060_0756,didn't wonder why but then when we went
Man055_Woman060_0757,to like valerie's party he was all over
Man055_Woman060_0758,his Abela so I was really confused
Man055_Woman060_0759,he's weird I feel like he doesn't know
Man055_Woman060_0760,what he wants I actually think he was
Man055_Woman060_0761,just being friendly with both but still
Man055_Woman060_0762,I don't understand why the first person
Man055_Woman060_0763,I mentioned like why so I mean that's
Man055_Woman060_0764,the best part about like not speaking to
Man055_Woman060_0765,any more is they don't have to worry
Man055_Woman060_0766,about any of that is it is it your
Man055_Woman060_0767,tournament it was you got the one at the
Man055_Woman060_0768,bottom right yeah so then didn't you do
Man055_Woman060_0769,the lesson1 wait what was the last
Man055_Woman060_0770,question your answer what can i improve
Man055_Woman060_0771,- what can I do to improve my
Man055_Woman060_0772,relationship I don't even remember how
Man055_Woman060_0773,we started talking about this how think
Man055_Woman060_0774,about how many cards do you have
Man055_Woman060_0775,okay what are the next steps in our
Man055_Woman060_0776,relationship I feel like the biggest
Man055_Woman060_0777,step in our relationship is going off to
Man055_Woman060_0778,separate colleges and remaining in the
Man055_Woman060_0779,contact because I feel like when I
Man055_Woman060_0780,graduated middle school and I had like
Man055_Woman060_0781,so I don't even care if you block these
Man055_Woman060_0782,peoples names out I don't know if you're
Man055_Woman060_0783,going to but it doesn't really matter
Man055_Woman060_0784,sorry that we keep looking at the camera
Man055_Woman060_0785,by the way yeah sorry I would keep
Man055_Woman060_0786,asking you questions you can block out
Man055_Woman060_0787,everyone prior to this I feel like I was
Man055_Woman060_0788,friends with some of this girl named
Man055_Woman060_0789,Simone and I think you've told me about
Man055_Woman060_0790,it before and like another girl named
Man055_Woman060_0791,Teresa and we're all really close
Man055_Woman060_0792,because we had all the same classes
Man055_Woman060_0793,together like the entire day we sat next
Man055_Woman060_0794,to each other and learn some of LA and
Man055_Woman060_0795,then like literally the day of the last
Man055_Woman060_0796,day of school I asked them if they
Man055_Woman060_0797,wanted to do something they're like oh
Man055_Woman060_0798,no we're going home and I'm fine with
Man055_Woman060_0799,that like like I'm fine if you don't
Man055_Woman060_0800,want to do anything but then whenever I
Man055_Woman060_0801,asked them to do stuff they would like
Man055_Woman060_0802,ignore me
Man055_Woman060_0803,so it was like right after we graduated
Man055_Woman060_0804,you don't want to talk to me anymore
Man055_Woman060_0805,which is really really fake because
Man055_Woman060_0806,we've known each other for such a long
Man055_Woman060_0807,time and it's like really really long
Man055_Woman060_0808,because at least six hours every day we
Man055_Woman060_0809,spent non-stop sitting next to each
Man055_Woman060_0810,other talking about everything but I
Man055_Woman060_0811,feel like I'm kind of paranoid to
Man055_Woman060_0812,graduate well not to go
Man055_Woman060_0813,graduated area paranoid to remain rat
Man055_Woman060_0814,friends because I don't want to feel
Man055_Woman060_0815,like if I'm talking to you
Man055_Woman060_0816,that you don't want to talk to me I
Man055_Woman060_0817,really don't like that feeling I don't
Man055_Woman060_0818,like this makes me that's exactly what I
Man055_Woman060_0819,was talking about earlier that's what
Man055_Woman060_0820,I'm worried about but I think if we're
Man055_Woman060_0821,both conscious of it as we seem that
Man055_Woman060_0822,where are we are I think we'll be okay
Man055_Woman060_0823,I'd like in my head I just keep
Man055_Woman060_0824,picturing like when we go back for like
Man055_Woman060_0825,reunions or things like that and we see
Man055_Woman060_0826,each other I don't want it to be that
Man055_Woman060_0827,case where that's where we're seeing
Man055_Woman060_0828,each other for the first time or that's
Man055_Woman060_0829,the first time we're hearing from each
Man055_Woman060_0830,other again because then there's that
Man055_Woman060_0831,disconnect because I always feel like
Man055_Woman060_0832,with us and with like Xiomara - you
Man055_Woman060_0833,don't have to bleep her name out anyway
Man055_Woman060_0834,- every time even if we go like a few
Man055_Woman060_0835,days or like weeks without talking every
Man055_Woman060_0836,time we started talking again it's as if
Man055_Woman060_0837,like we didn't stop talking and we can
Man055_Woman060_0838,just continue any conversation and like
Man055_Woman060_0839,make fun of each other and like be okay
Man055_Woman060_0840,with that or like be honest with each
Man055_Woman060_0841,other and ask each other questions and
Man055_Woman060_0842,just talk it's probably yeah the
Man055_Woman060_0843,relationship I have with you guys is
Man055_Woman060_0844,like probably one of the best ones I've
Man055_Woman060_0845,ever had with any friends just because I
Man055_Woman060_0846,feel like we can all be really honest
Man055_Woman060_0847,with each other and we've always been
Man055_Woman060_0848,really honest with each other but I
Man055_Woman060_0849,think that because we're all conscious
Man055_Woman060_0850,of that we'll be okay
Man055_Woman060_0851,hopefully we also don't want to
Man055_Woman060_0852,overthink everything yeah
Man055_Woman060_0853,why are you maintaining this friendship
Man055_Woman060_0854,I don't know I don't know why are we
Man055_Woman060_0855,here
Man055_Woman060_0856,I think in speaking about like why we
Man055_Woman060_0857,didn't talk to each other for a really
Man055_Woman060_0858,long time it would have been really easy
Man055_Woman060_0859,well not really easy but it would be an
Man055_Woman060_0860,easier so you just like forget about
Man055_Woman060_0861,each other or like not talk to each
Man055_Woman060_0862,other after we've already not been
Man055_Woman060_0863,speaking it takes more work to like pick
Man055_Woman060_0864,up a friendship when it's already like
Man055_Woman060_0865,in shambles or not in shambles that's
Man055_Woman060_0866,dramatic but just know it'll not out
Man055_Woman060_0867,going well I think that on both of our
Man055_Woman060_0868,parts
Man055_Woman060_0869,we just realized that we care about the
Man055_Woman060_0870,friendship and we care about the
Man055_Woman060_0871,relationship so putting in more work or
Man055_Woman060_0872,putting in more effort to just
Man055_Woman060_0873,communicate more or like ask each other
Man055_Woman060_0874,how the other person's doing or just
Man055_Woman060_0875,spend more time with each other before
Man055_Woman060_0876,we both like go our separate ways
Man055_Woman060_0877,is important to both of us I'm
Man055_Woman060_0878,maintaining the friendship because I
Man055_Woman060_0879,like I like your company I think you're
Man055_Woman060_0880,a good person despite what anyone might
Man055_Woman060_0881,think I think you're gonna do really
Man055_Woman060_0882,awesome things in life and you'll be
Man055_Woman060_0883,like the coolest sassiest doctor ever
Man055_Woman060_0884,and I'm gonna be really proud of you
Man055_Woman060_0885,when you do that and there's no like
Man055_Woman060_0886,with us and but zmr I feel like there's
Man055_Woman060_0887,no room for like being jealous of one
Man055_Woman060_0888,another's accomplishments or like and
Man055_Woman060_0889,being that other person for like doing
Man055_Woman060_0890,something we couldn't do just because
Man055_Woman060_0891,we're all really supportive of each
Man055_Woman060_0892,other and we're the type to cheer each
Man055_Woman060_0893,other on even if we don't have that same
Man055_Woman060_0894,opportunity because something else will
Man055_Woman060_0895,come for us and we'll be fine
Man055_Woman060_0896,like a talk so much what do you hope for
Man055_Woman060_0897,my future and this is both so we both
Man055_Woman060_0898,have to answer it's weird because we
Man055_Woman060_0899,were just talking about them for your
Man055_Woman060_0900,future I hope we become a really quirky
Man055_Woman060_0901,CEO of something that you really enjoy
Man055_Woman060_0902,as of now I know that you really like
Man055_Woman060_0903,hula hoops but I don't know if you'll
Man055_Woman060_0904,maintain not maintain but continue to
Man055_Woman060_0905,develop that company but I feel like
Man055_Woman060_0906,you're gonna find your niche somewhere
Man055_Woman060_0907,and I like the fact that you're not
Man055_Woman060_0908,gonna be a boring boss because I feel
Man055_Woman060_0909,like what why hire someone that's boring
Man055_Woman060_0910,but I won't be like Michael Scott yeah I
Man055_Woman060_0911,mean I kind of answered that already but
Man055_Woman060_0912,I'll maybe answer and like not career
Man055_Woman060_0913,goals I hope that in the future you find
Man055_Woman060_0914,someone that you know you really like
Man055_Woman060_0915,their company someone that you'd love
Man055_Woman060_0916,someone that you feel like you can be
Man055_Woman060_0917,open about how you feel and have a good
Man055_Woman060_0918,relationship with that person hopefully
Man055_Woman060_0919,someone that's really cute
Man055_Woman060_0920,you know it doesn't it doesn't hurt and
Man055_Woman060_0921,yeah I hope you just I hope that you I'm
Man055_Woman060_0922,kind of like rambling but I I think
Man055_Woman060_0923,ultimately I hope that when you look
Man055_Woman060_0924,back on like these next few years and
Man055_Woman060_0925,like whatever you're gonna do in college
Man055_Woman060_0926,or even what you did in high school just
Man055_Woman060_0927,your next two years of life you don't
Man055_Woman060_0928,have any regrets about who you've chosen
Man055_Woman060_0929,to like surround yourself with and what
Man055_Woman060_0930,decisions or opportunities you've chosen
Man055_Woman060_0931,to like partake in like I would hope
Man055_Woman060_0932,that you wouldn't have any regrets of
Man055_Woman060_0933,like missed opportunities or of just
Man055_Woman060_0934,like maintaining relationships that you
Man055_Woman060_0935,didn't feel we're meaningful thank you
Man055_Woman060_0936,all right it's my last card why do you
Man055_Woman060_0937,care about me I don't know Turkey I care
Man055_Woman060_0938,about you because I think that you're
Man055_Woman060_0939,like I think the best way to explain you
Man055_Woman060_0940,is like or to like like the best analogy
Man055_Woman060_0941,for you is kind of like a light bulb I
Man055_Woman060_0942,feel like you shine we're really going I
Man055_Woman060_0943,feel like you shine really bright at
Man055_Woman060_0944,times and then sometimes maybe like the
Man055_Woman060_0945,circuit is open and then you're like
Man055_Woman060_0946,kind of flickers out but there's always
Man055_Woman060_0947,a way to like turn you back on kind of
Man055_Woman060_0948,like a light bulb with an orbit too
Man055_Woman060_0949,because not an orbit but like raised
Man055_Woman060_0950,because you make other people smile also
Man055_Woman060_0951,clip parts of light bulbs yeah and I
Man055_Woman060_0952,like I like being around people that
Man055_Woman060_0953,make me laugh because in life we're
Man055_Woman060_0954,gonna face things that won't necessarily
Man055_Woman060_0955,be the best and I like to surround
Man055_Woman060_0956,myself with people that I know that will
Man055_Woman060_0957,bring me up when I'm feeling down yeah I
Man055_Woman060_0958,agree
Man055_Woman060_0959,what have you learned from me that's
Man055_Woman060_0960,change you
Man055_Woman060_0961,like this is one of those questions
Man055_Woman060_0962,where like I have learned a lot but it's
Man055_Woman060_0963,like I've never thought about this so I
Man055_Woman060_0964,need to give it a second I think I know
Man055_Woman060_0965,my answer I think that I've learned like
Man055_Woman060_0966,not to give a shit about what anyone
Man055_Woman060_0967,thinks about me just because even from
Man055_Woman060_0968,like the get-go like before I even knew
Man055_Woman060_0969,you I always thought you were really
Man055_Woman060_0970,intimidating because I can tell that
Man055_Woman060_0971,like you didn't care what anyone thought
Man055_Woman060_0972,of you and you were gonna do whatever
Man055_Woman060_0973,you wanted to do within reason just
Man055_Woman060_0974,because you were comfortable with
Man055_Woman060_0975,yourself and you were a confident person
Man055_Woman060_0976,I really wasn't that confident even just
Man055_Woman060_0977,like two three years ago and I think
Man055_Woman060_0978,that just surrounding myself with
Man055_Woman060_0979,someone like you who is so confident and
Man055_Woman060_0980,comfortable in their own skin and like
Man055_Woman060_0981,okay with just being themselves and
Man055_Woman060_0982,either letting people accept that or not
Man055_Woman060_0983,accept it and that's fine too
Man055_Woman060_0984,I think that has taught me to be more
Man055_Woman060_0985,confident has taught me to like not feel
Man055_Woman060_0986,ashamed to like ask the question or just
Man055_Woman060_0987,be me like I don't apologize for being
Man055_Woman060_0988,myself
Man055_Woman060_0989,I'm the apologetic but I think that's
Man055_Woman060_0990,what I've learned you you've made me a
Man055_Woman060_0991,more confident person and I think
Man055_Woman060_0992,Xiomara is learning that too yeah she's
Man055_Woman060_0993,getting there I'm glad I feel like I'm
Man055_Woman060_0994,gonna answer the question I feel like in
Man055_Woman060_0995,the and like this may not seem like as
Man055_Woman060_0996,life-changing as like confidence but I
Man055_Woman060_0997,feel like I've learned from you it's
Man055_Woman060_0998,okay to study because I never really
Man055_Woman060_0999,like studying at all and I feel like
Man055_Woman060_1000,studying is kind of a waste of time but
Man055_Woman060_1001,I realized it is really important even
Man055_Woman060_1002,if you do know something to study
Man055_Woman060_1003,because looking back I know that if I
Man055_Woman060_1004,wasn't study for like at least ten
Man055_Woman060_1005,minutes the better yeah but I didn't
Man055_Woman060_1006,study at all and I'm gonna take that
Man055_Woman060_1007,into college to study I feel like part
Man055_Woman060_1008,of that with like a lot of people not
Man055_Woman060_1009,just see like a lot of kids that we went
Man055_Woman060_1010,to school with I think the thing is like
Man055_Woman060_1011,you always hear that like educate
Man055_Woman060_1012,so important and you know without an
Man055_Woman060_1013,education you're not gonna go anywhere
Man055_Woman060_1014,in life or you're not gonna get a job
Man055_Woman060_1015,but I think once you realize that like
Man055_Woman060_1016,you genuinely need this to go after the
Man055_Woman060_1017,dreams that you have and the goals that
Man055_Woman060_1018,you have it becomes so much more
Man055_Woman060_1019,meaningful because it's a privilege that
Man055_Woman060_1020,not everyone has and to take that for
Man055_Woman060_1021,granted every day seems really selfish
Man055_Woman060_1022,and it is really selfish so I think when
Man055_Woman060_1023,you're doing something that you really
Man055_Woman060_1024,enjoy like you're studying something you
Man055_Woman060_1025,really enjoyed like pre matter my weird
Man055_Woman060_1026,major it doesn't seem like a hassle or
Man055_Woman060_1027,it doesn't seem like schools a drag just
Man055_Woman060_1028,because you know that with that
Man055_Woman060_1029,knowledge and with that information not
Man055_Woman060_1030,only are you privileged to get it but
Man055_Woman060_1031,you can actually make a difference and
Man055_Woman060_1032,help somebody else but hasn't had that
Man055_Woman060_1033,same privilege do you think we'll be
Man055_Woman060_1034,close in 15 years why or why not I don't
Man055_Woman060_1035,know I feel like that's like I want to
Man055_Woman060_1036,say yes and I hope yes but I don't know
Man055_Woman060_1037,I feel I don't know I really don't know
Man055_Woman060_1038,how to answer that again like I'd like
Man055_Woman060_1039,to say yes and I would hope that we keep
Man055_Woman060_1040,in contact and as we get older we'll go
Man055_Woman060_1041,to each other's houses or apartments
Man055_Woman060_1042,spend time with each other like go out
Man055_Woman060_1043,to lunch and do things like that but
Man055_Woman060_1044,it's it's those weird things where
Man055_Woman060_1045,you're having different experiences and
Man055_Woman060_1046,you're meeting new people so you're not
Man055_Woman060_1047,on the same page anymore but again I
Man055_Woman060_1048,have hope that because you me and Jim
Man055_Woman060_1049,are so close as it is we'll be okay
Man055_Woman060_1050,but I think thinking even like five
Man055_Woman060_1051,years into the futures already kind of
Man055_Woman060_1052,scary so I don't I don't have a
Man055_Woman060_1053,definitive answer
Man055_Woman060_1054,I think thinking a few months into the
Man055_Woman060_1055,future yeah I feel like I'm gonna answer
Man055_Woman060_1056,the question
Man055_Woman060_1057,I don't really know either but I do know
Man055_Woman060_1058,that I'll still think of you yeah
Man055_Woman060_1059,because I still think of people from
Man055_Woman060_1060,like Simone like I still think of her I
Man055_Woman060_1061,don't like I don't like what she did and
Man055_Woman060_1062,that would I would accept her apology
Man055_Woman060_1063,but I would it's like you've learned
Man055_Woman060_1064,something yeah
Man055_Woman060_1065,they were a part of your life for so
Man055_Woman060_1066,long that you can't just act like they
Man055_Woman060_1067,didn't exist yeah I don't know how
Man055_Woman060_1068,people do that I don't I don't think
Man055_Woman060_1069,anyone can do that and I feel like
Man055_Woman060_1070,anyone that says if they can is lying
Man055_Woman060_1071,because that's that's not possible you
Man055_Woman060_1072,know you even when you're alone you
Man055_Woman060_1073,you'll think about it at some point err
Man055_Woman060_1074,which is fine I think people just need
Man055_Woman060_1075,to know that it's okay to feel emotions
Man055_Woman060_1076,we're not robots yeah I mean do you want
Man055_Woman060_1077,to ask me anything else while we're here
Man055_Woman060_1078,or say anything that you feel like you
Man055_Woman060_1079,haven't been able to say and I might say
Man055_Woman060_1080,something you don't have to I'm just
Man055_Woman060_1081,asking hope that you really do well in
Man055_Woman060_1082,school and not that you are going to but
Man055_Woman060_1083,like when I went to my orientation I
Man055_Woman060_1084,realized how many intelligent people
Man055_Woman060_1085,were there
Man055_Woman060_1086,and like for once in my life I was
Man055_Woman060_1087,intimidated by the people because in our
Man055_Woman060_1088,high school there were like less than
Man055_Woman060_1089,ten people that I considered smart so it
Man055_Woman060_1090,didn't really dissuade me or like
Man055_Woman060_1091,intimidate me but now that we're both
Man055_Woman060_1092,going to schools where there's gonna be
Man055_Woman060_1093,a lot of smart people I don't I hope
Man055_Woman060_1094,that that doesn't just wait you I hope
Man055_Woman060_1095,so too
Man055_Woman060_1096,I've thought about that but I think you
Man055_Woman060_1097,just kind of have to worry about like
Man055_Woman060_1098,what you're doing and not compare
Man055_Woman060_1099,yourself to other people but I think
Man055_Woman060_1100,we'll we'll be fine I worry about
Man055_Woman060_1101,Xiomara a little bit just because even
Man055_Woman060_1102,though she tells us that like she's
Man055_Woman060_1103,happy where she's going I feel like
Man055_Woman060_1104,she's not being 100% honest even with
Man055_Woman060_1105,herself but like she really has nothing
Man055_Woman060_1106,to
Man055_Woman060_1107,be excited about in my opinion because I
Man055_Woman060_1108,think she's like--she's she's gonna be
Man055_Woman060_1109,great and I think that again that has to
Man055_Woman060_1110,do with like self-confidence she doesn't
Man055_Woman060_1111,see what we see but like she's an
Man055_Woman060_1112,amazing person
Man055_Woman060_1113,and not just like personally but
Man055_Woman060_1114,academically and like socially I think
Man055_Woman060_1115,she'll be fine she just needs to like
Man055_Woman060_1116,kind of come into her own and like gain
Man055_Woman060_1117,more confidence grow a lot not sorry to
Man055_Woman060_1118,cut you off at a late time but it she's
Man055_Woman060_1119,gonna draw a lot of college and I can't
Man055_Woman060_1120,wait to see her blossom yeah guess so
Man055_Woman060_1121,let's try to do the thirty second thing
Man055_Woman060_1122,but not laugh right
Man055_Woman060_1123,I broke eye contact
