Woman024_Woman025_0062,lady but she does enjoy this stuff more
Woman024_Woman025_0063,than the experience sometimes so it took
Woman024_Woman025_0064,me a while to really realize that that
Woman024_Woman025_0065,was kind of the wrong path how can I be
Woman024_Woman025_0066,a better mom
Woman024_Woman025_0067,don't worry about hurting my family
Woman024_Woman025_0068,that's a hard question I know yeah

Woman024_Woman025_0076,monkey bars and fractured three
Woman024_Woman025_0077,vertebrae ya scared the crap out of me
Woman024_Woman025_0078,for a long time yeah I'm scared me too
Woman024_Woman025_0079,yeah I was a hard hard few weeks when
Woman024_Woman025_0080,you were right after your injury but
Woman024_Woman025_0081,look at you you're amazing
Woman024_Woman025_0082,Wow what moments did you feel I
Woman024_Woman025_0083,abandoned you
Woman024_Woman025_0084,[Music]
Woman024_Woman025_0085,I don't think I've ever felt that she
Woman024_Woman025_0086,has that you have okay
Woman024_Woman025_0087,well that settles that thank goodness
Woman024_Woman025_0088,what have you learned for me that
Woman024_Woman025_0089,changed you well so a few things let me
Woman024_Woman025_0090,think
Woman024_Woman025_0091,well how I want to answer it um to be
Woman024_Woman025_0092,grateful I'm gonna need one second so I
Woman024_Woman025_0093,don't lose it
Woman024_Woman025_0094,don't
Woman024_Woman025_0095,okay to be grateful because when you
Woman024_Woman025_0096,broke your back and we were so scared my
Woman024_Woman025_0097,all of my energy went to worry and
Woman024_Woman025_0098,instead of so all that worrying all the
Woman024_Woman025_0099,time can make you crazy
Woman024_Woman025_0100,so as your recovery continued I couldn't
Woman024_Woman025_0101,keep thinking that way so I started to
Woman024_Woman025_0102,consciously try to turn my thoughts
Woman024_Woman025_0103,around to turn the worry into gratitude
Woman024_Woman025_0104,and just be grateful that you were going
Woman024_Woman025_0105,to me instead of worrying that you
Woman024_Woman025_0106,weren't okay at the moment and also in
Woman024_Woman025_0107,addition to that it taught me that it's
Woman024_Woman025_0108,really important that when someone is
Woman024_Woman025_0109,sick or injured or having a hard time in
Woman024_Woman025_0110,some way that it's important to really
Woman024_Woman025_0111,understand that even though the
Woman024_Woman025_0112,circumstances have somehow changed the
Woman024_Woman025_0113,person in those circumstances is still
Woman024_Woman025_0114,his or her self so to not see people
Woman024_Woman025_0115,through the lens of an injury or a
Woman024_Woman025_0116,disability or a diagnosis just see them
Woman024_Woman025_0117,for who they are
Woman024_Woman025_0118,if you could change one thing about me
Woman024_Woman025_0119,what would it be and why
Woman024_Woman025_0120,okay I'm not gonna answer I know about
Woman024_Woman025_0121,because I don't know what do you think
Woman024_Woman025_0122,you missed out on me what do you think
Woman024_Woman025_0123,you missed out on by becoming a parent
Woman024_Woman025_0124,nothing I answered this one with it'd be
Woman024_Woman025_0125,bit too and being a parent is a choice
Woman024_Woman025_0126,so anything that I've missed out on I've
Woman024_Woman025_0127,missed out on because I chose to miss
Woman024_Woman025_0128,out on it what do you think I'm learning
Woman024_Woman025_0129,from you maybe to like
Woman024_Woman025_0130,uh try more things right yes because you
Woman024_Woman025_0131,told me like when you were my age and
Woman024_Woman025_0132,stuff you didn't go and try a lot of
Woman024_Woman025_0133,things um but you said now I'm in like
Woman024_Woman025_0134,the student council stuff and I do
Woman024_Woman025_0135,guitar and piano and sports and magic
Woman024_Woman025_0136,and stuff like that um so yeah that's
Woman024_Woman025_0137,true when do you think I take I take you
Woman024_Woman025_0138,for granted
Woman024_Woman025_0139,why so I know sometimes I probably do
Woman024_Woman025_0140,and I think it's generally when I need
Woman024_Woman025_0141,Aviva to have company and entertainment
Woman024_Woman025_0142,and I rely on you to be helpful in that
Woman024_Woman025_0143,regard and I often don't thank you for
Woman024_Woman025_0144,it so thank you
Woman024_Woman025_0145,what are you hesitant to tell me
Woman024_Woman025_0146,no a lot of stuff I know we talk about
Woman024_Woman025_0147,everything
Woman024_Woman025_0148,yeah I guess nothing yeah that's not a
Woman024_Woman025_0149,relevant question what's the hardest
Woman024_Woman025_0150,thing about being a mom um I answered
Woman024_Woman025_0151,this with Aviva to but basically to let
Woman024_Woman025_0152,you guys explore the limits of your
Woman024_Woman025_0153,selves without being afraid for you and
Woman024_Woman025_0154,yeah and just letting you be without
Woman024_Woman025_0155,fear or anxiety or anything what do you
Woman024_Woman025_0156,think is special about our relationship
Woman024_Woman025_0157,[Music]
Woman024_Woman025_0158,we have fun together and stuff we do
Woman024_Woman025_0159,yeah what's the biggest sacrifice you've
Woman024_Woman025_0160,made that I haven't account
Woman024_Woman025_0161,acknowledged um it's the same answers
Woman024_Woman025_0162,before I became a mom because I chose to
Woman024_Woman025_0163,become a mom and so nothing is really a
Woman024_Woman025_0164,sacrifice because it's everything I do
Woman024_Woman025_0165,is based around the choice I made by
Woman024_Woman025_0166,having children and making them a
Woman024_Woman025_0167,priority so no sacrifices just you guys
Woman024_Woman025_0168,are my priority and that is that what do
Woman024_Woman025_0169,you think are my best qualities as a
Woman024_Woman025_0170,mother
Woman024_Woman025_0171,um well you're carrying your loving and
Woman024_Woman025_0172,you help us when we're sick and stuff so
Woman024_Woman025_0173,like helpful um but you're also fun
Woman024_Woman025_0174,stuff so
Woman024_Woman025_0175,when do you worry about me and why um
Woman024_Woman025_0176,when do I worry about you well all the
Woman024_Woman025_0177,time and never all the time because
Woman024_Woman025_0178,that's just what parents do and never
Woman024_Woman025_0179,because I know you are capable of so
Woman024_Woman025_0180,much do you think you'll be a good
Woman024_Woman025_0181,mother and why that depends if I have
Woman024_Woman025_0182,kids um but if I do probably because um
Woman024_Woman025_0183,I'm a pretty caring person and parents
Woman024_Woman025_0184,have to be caring so mm-hmm I think
Woman024_Woman025_0185,you'll be a great mom what are you
Woman024_Woman025_0186,worried about for me in my future I
Woman024_Woman025_0187,worry that if you explore the path of
Woman024_Woman025_0188,being a human rights advocate and an
Woman024_Woman025_0189,attorney that you'll put yourself in
Woman024_Woman025_0190,situations that are very dangerous but
Woman024_Woman025_0191,like I said before I worry about
Woman024_Woman025_0192,everything and nothing because I know
Woman024_Woman025_0193,you can handle it
Woman024_Woman025_0194,Jesus this is a loaded one I don't even
Woman024_Woman025_0195,know if she's gonna know how to answer
Woman024_Woman025_0196,this what's the pain in me you'd like to
Woman024_Woman025_0197,heal yeah I don't know yeah I don't
Woman024_Woman025_0198,think you've know either how am I most
Woman024_Woman025_0199,like you and how does that scary um I
Woman024_Woman025_0200,don't think the ways you're like me

Woman024_Woman025_0212,eyes and that's great too

Woman024_Woman025_0219,and smart and funny and fearless that's
Woman024_Woman025_0220,those are generally the adjectives I use
Woman024_Woman025_0221,smart occasionally I I slip the word
Woman024_Woman025_0222,gorgeous in there but yeah all of those
Woman024_Woman025_0223,things
Woman024_Woman025_0224,why do you love me cuz you're my mom and
