Man051_Woman056_0001,do you have my cell phone no I'm gonna
Man051_Woman056_0002,check my mic
Man051_Woman056_0003,when you think of the first time we met
Man051_Woman056_0004,what do you remember
Man051_Woman056_0005,Mary's bus very suppose yeah start in
Man051_Woman056_0006,ninth grade you would love here today
Man051_Woman056_0007,like that I go but does it make you
Man051_Woman056_0008,think of it takes me back there as well
Man051_Woman056_0009,but mostly afternoons waiting for Mary's
Man051_Woman056_0010,bus and different
Man051_Woman056_0011,what do you love about our relationship
Man051_Woman056_0012,how open we are to each other we just
Man051_Woman056_0013,discuss anything and everything there's
Man051_Woman056_0014,no there's no walls
Man051_Woman056_0015,what about the same we don't have any
Man051_Woman056_0016,real conflicts in terms of who we are
Man051_Woman056_0017,and how we are with each other whenever
Man051_Woman056_0018,each other's external factors don't
Man051_Woman056_0019,really matter
Man051_Woman056_0020,was it what is it about me that makes
Man051_Woman056_0021,you think I understand you you listen
Man051_Woman056_0022,and you try and fix the problem but I
Man051_Woman056_0023,think mostly throughout the years that
Man051_Woman056_0024,we've been together and I think the fact
Man051_Woman056_0025,that we were friends before we actually
Man051_Woman056_0026,started a relationship take a romantic
Man051_Woman056_0027,relationship you got to know me you know
Man051_Woman056_0028,so I think by the time we decided to
Man051_Woman056_0029,turn this into a romantic relationship
Man051_Woman056_0030,you basically do like what would make me
Man051_Woman056_0031,angry or how to keep me calm I would say
Man051_Woman056_0032,what about you yeah I mean I think
Man051_Woman056_0033,definitely of being friends before
Man051_Woman056_0034,having a relationship was definitely a
Man051_Woman056_0035,factor that helped in the flourishing of
Man051_Woman056_0036,our relationship
Man051_Woman056_0037,what do you hesitant to tell me I know
Man051_Woman056_0038,I'm hesitant to tell you something but I
Man051_Woman056_0039,just can't put my finger on it
Man051_Woman056_0040,how about you I don't know I think with
Man051_Woman056_0041,how long we've been together
Man051_Woman056_0042,not well you know there's something
Man051_Woman056_0043,about to me I let it bottle up and then
Man051_Woman056_0044,I explode so that's right now nothing
Man051_Woman056_0045,what's my super sex skill you can't get
Man051_Woman056_0046,a no-phone super sex Colonel Angus so
Man051_Woman056_0047,that would say yeah I mean you have
Man051_Woman056_0048,others but yeah they're super sex go is
Man051_Woman056_0049,just how you just let go you yourself
Man051_Woman056_0050,there's no why there's a fucking plenty
Man051_Woman056_0051,comfortable well ma'am
Man051_Woman056_0052,I would agree I do feel comfortable
Man051_Woman056_0053,what is the sexual fantasy you're afraid
Man051_Woman056_0054,to ask me
Man051_Woman056_0055,okay
Man051_Woman056_0056,who sacrifices more in our relationship
Man051_Woman056_0057,and how do you feel about that
Man051_Woman056_0058,it'll depend with my contacts really
Man051_Woman056_0059,yeah I think we've each made equal
Man051_Woman056_0060,sacrifices for a relationship I think
Man051_Woman056_0061,I've had to overcome the most obstacles
Man051_Woman056_0062,but in terms of sacrificing I think
Man051_Woman056_0063,we've each made our own I think the
Man051_Woman056_0064,biggest one has been like putting our
Man051_Woman056_0065,engagement on hold and kind of getting
Man051_Woman056_0066,our lives in order you know going back
Man051_Woman056_0067,to school
Man051_Woman056_0068,it's a fortunate sacrifice - yeah what
Man051_Woman056_0069,about you
Man051_Woman056_0070,I think it's it's just a common
Man051_Woman056_0071,sacrifice in marriage many relationships
Man051_Woman056_0072,might go through of like putting
Man051_Woman056_0073,themselves or not being selfish too to
Man051_Woman056_0074,make sure the other are significant how
Man051_Woman056_0075,their reach their goals
Man051_Woman056_0076,what do you wish I would just get over
Man051_Woman056_0077,and let go your fears I wish that you
Man051_Woman056_0078,just let life happen not you know like
Man051_Woman056_0079,every decision that you make doesn't
Man051_Woman056_0080,need to have a what if it's gonna happen
Man051_Woman056_0081,one way or another I feel like I have
Man051_Woman056_0082,maybe over-analytical off things and
Man051_Woman056_0083,don't let things just flow through yeah
Man051_Woman056_0084,yeah I mean we've had that discussion
Man051_Woman056_0085,before I have no kids no big house I
Man051_Woman056_0086,wouldn't take care of yeah life is gonna
Man051_Woman056_0087,happen one way or another what about
Man051_Woman056_0088,I guess to a certain extent is just like
Man051_Woman056_0089,me figuring it out but uh it's
Man051_Woman056_0090,definitely helped me just the pressure
Man051_Woman056_0091,you put on me on in that sense in that
Man051_Woman056_0092,room that's kind of like branching out
Man051_Woman056_0093,from that question it's something that
Man051_Woman056_0094,that you've helped me grow in a sense
Man051_Woman056_0095,usually when I kind of hold myself back
Man051_Woman056_0096,you push me on push me off the cliff
Man051_Woman056_0097,in a good way
Man051_Woman056_0098,I think this one was not for you mmm but
Man051_Woman056_0099,are you afraid that you'll become like
Man051_Woman056_0100,your father
Man051_Woman056_0101,yeah
Man051_Woman056_0102,why yeah and I feel like as much as I
Man051_Woman056_0103,try not to laughter he's a bad man or
Man051_Woman056_0104,anything like that but I feel like the
Man051_Woman056_0105,emotional barriers that he has as I said
Man051_Woman056_0106,try to push trying to make sure I don't
Man051_Woman056_0107,build those I feel like it could happen
Man051_Woman056_0108,it comes in a inevitable through truth
Man051_Woman056_0109,as much as I fight for
Man051_Woman056_0110,do do you think the way that your mom
Man051_Woman056_0111,may have brought you up or maybe your
Man051_Woman056_0112,grandmother has influenced the way that
Man051_Woman056_0113,you're not like your father in that way
Man051_Woman056_0114,of your emotional barriers and yeah it
Man051_Woman056_0115,gave me a nice balance we tended to my
Man051_Woman056_0116,mother could be very open oh my my
Man051_Woman056_0117,father at times doesn't really show it
Man051_Woman056_0118,although it's I know it's there I don't
Man051_Woman056_0119,know if it's just I guess this step and
Man051_Woman056_0120,Hispanic male stereotypes in might
Man051_Woman056_0121,induce it or or whatnot as I get older I
Man051_Woman056_0122,realized that that the emotions are
Man051_Woman056_0123,there and he seeks to express it it's
Man051_Woman056_0124,just uh he doesn't know how to do you
Man051_Woman056_0125,think that'll change or kind of it'll be
Man051_Woman056_0126,better now since we're planning a
Man051_Woman056_0127,wedding and we're trying to keep both of
Man051_Woman056_0128,your parents involved yeah yeah I
Man051_Woman056_0129,definitely do think so
Man051_Woman056_0130,okay can you give him that card and have
Man051_Woman056_0131,him be
Man051_Woman056_0132,are you afraid I'll become like your
Man051_Woman056_0133,father no I think part of the reason why
Man051_Woman056_0134,I stayed with you as long as I have and
Man051_Woman056_0135,part of the reason why I guess I kind of
Man051_Woman056_0136,chose you it's because you're nothing
Man051_Woman056_0137,like my father I'm the only way that you
Man051_Woman056_0138,are similar is in your taste of music
Man051_Woman056_0139,but that's about it
Man051_Woman056_0140,I don't luckily I don't have that that
Man051_Woman056_0141,fear I think we have we communicate well
Man051_Woman056_0142,enough that if you ever feel that I'm
Man051_Woman056_0143,not enough that if whatever the case
Man051_Woman056_0144,might be I think we have that that open
Man051_Woman056_0145,communication so I don't I don't fear it
Man051_Woman056_0146,who lives who more in this relationship
Man051_Woman056_0147,what I do obviously I mean I mean that's
Man051_Woman056_0148,not something I've never really like
Man051_Woman056_0149,looked at to measure or when I I don't
Man051_Woman056_0150,think it's something that you need to
Man051_Woman056_0151,unless it's something completely and
Man051_Woman056_0152,utterly obvious but I don't seek to
Man051_Woman056_0153,measure it at all I don't know I think
Man051_Woman056_0154,our friends would argue that I love you
Man051_Woman056_0155,more
Man051_Woman056_0156,what do you wish I would forgive you for
Man051_Woman056_0157,being reckless with my money yeah I
Man051_Woman056_0158,think the fact that I grew up in a
Man051_Woman056_0159,household where both my parents are very
Man051_Woman056_0160,reckless with their money and they
Man051_Woman056_0161,didn't really teach me how to be how to
Man051_Woman056_0162,prepare for adulthood you know that was
Man051_Woman056_0163,coming from Cuba and all um I didn't
Man051_Woman056_0164,have the financial bed and say you had
Man051_Woman056_0165,there was no preparation for me it was
Man051_Woman056_0166,just whole great I got a job at 19 now
Man051_Woman056_0167,I'm gonna spend that money so that's one
Man051_Woman056_0168,thing I definitely should forgive me for
Man051_Woman056_0169,forgive you a long time ago
Man051_Woman056_0170,it's interesting because I've been
Man051_Woman056_0171,wanting to ask you this for a very long
Man051_Woman056_0172,time now so why do you love me
Man051_Woman056_0173,because I think to what become um I'm
Man051_Woman056_0174,not sure II would have become Who I am
Man051_Woman056_0175,it wasn't for you and again like I
Man051_Woman056_0176,mentioned before the you pushed me along
Man051_Woman056_0177,you know me to take risks and we built
Man051_Woman056_0178,upon each other because of that I could
Man051_Woman056_0179,be myself I don't have to put on a
Man051_Woman056_0180,facade things a lot of people that do
Man051_Woman056_0181,that and and in doing so a lot of people
Man051_Woman056_0182,lose who they are maybe they don't
Man051_Woman056_0183,remember who they are before or what not
Man051_Woman056_0184,who they want to be but that's
Man051_Woman056_0185,definitely it
Man051_Woman056_0186,I mean you're my best friend you're my
Man051_Woman056_0187,lover you're I could express anything
Man051_Woman056_0188,having my mind and my heart with you
