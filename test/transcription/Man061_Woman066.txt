Man061_Woman066_0001,that's okay
Man061_Woman066_0002,when you think about the first time we
Man061_Woman066_0003,met what do you remember I charge you a
Man061_Woman066_0004,dollar tease Kevin's bathroom and you're
Man061_Woman066_0005,not never formally introduced yeah it's
Man061_Woman066_0006,never next time at the same house isn't
Man061_Woman066_0007,it what's your favorite thing about me
Man061_Woman066_0008,your brain because you make up for my
Man061_Woman066_0009,lack of at least teaching me stuff all
Man061_Woman066_0010,the time so I always appreciate it
Man061_Woman066_0011,that's good for conversations where I
Man061_Woman066_0012,don't really know what's going on with
Man061_Woman066_0013,other people good you'll fill in then
Man061_Woman066_0014,what do you love about our relationship
Man061_Woman066_0015,I like that we're always trying new
Man061_Woman066_0016,things and even though my favorite thing
Man061_Woman066_0017,is that would really like different
Man061_Woman066_0018,things but our morals and where we come
Man061_Woman066_0019,from are the same so you know your
Man061_Woman066_0020,friends and your interests I have my
Man061_Woman066_0021,friends and my interests and but we
Man061_Woman066_0022,still have fun no matter what we're
Man061_Woman066_0023,doing or with who were hanging out with
Man061_Woman066_0024,me too when do you feel closest to me
Man061_Woman066_0025,when we're in bed
Man061_Woman066_0026,what are you hasn't it to tell me well
Man061_Woman066_0027,I'm not going to tell you because I'm
Man061_Woman066_0028,hesitant about it just like family
Man061_Woman066_0029,issues and stuff like that probably the
Man061_Woman066_0030,things I think about that I want to say
Man061_Woman066_0031,that I know I shouldn't say um if you
Man061_Woman066_0032,could change one thing in our
Man061_Woman066_0033,relationship what would it be and why I
Man061_Woman066_0034,would like it if you loved every one of
Man061_Woman066_0035,my jokes that I because a lot of them
Man061_Woman066_0036,that I say are really funny you just I
Man061_Woman066_0037,think you just tell yourself they're not
Man061_Woman066_0038,funny just to get a rise out of me but
Man061_Woman066_0039,who has more power in the relationship
Man061_Woman066_0040,you or me I think you could go either
Man061_Woman066_0041,way I think like emotionally you do
Man061_Woman066_0042,because you hold it together better for
Man061_Woman066_0043,the both of us when like I'm stressed
Man061_Woman066_0044,out you're stressed out but I think is
Man061_Woman066_0045,terms of like planning ahead for the
Man061_Woman066_0046,future and like keeping us on track for
Man061_Woman066_0047,our calls
Man061_Woman066_0048,I agree with that too and then we're
Man061_Woman066_0049,both hard-working so we're both aiming
Man061_Woman066_0050,for the same goal yeah so that's where
Man061_Woman066_0051,we come as a team yeah I think we both
Man061_Woman066_0052,keep ourselves on track in different
Man061_Woman066_0053,ways yeah tell me about the time I
Man061_Woman066_0054,disappointed you and how do you feel
Man061_Woman066_0055,about it now I think I know what you're
Man061_Woman066_0056,gonna say
Man061_Woman066_0057,I don't think
Man061_Woman066_0058,[Music]
Man061_Woman066_0059,stern on challenge I don't I can't think
Man061_Woman066_0060,of the last time that happened well you
Man061_Woman066_0061,don't have to think about the last time
Man061_Woman066_0062,it happened you could just attend to
Man061_Woman066_0063,block the disappointments out so I'm
Man061_Woman066_0064,worked up about them for the week or I
Man061_Woman066_0065,think about them for that week but after
Man061_Woman066_0066,that week I honestly just erased them
Man061_Woman066_0067,out of my head cuz that's not how I like
Man061_Woman066_0068,to look at you I look at you for all the
Man061_Woman066_0069,positive and good things and it's always
Man061_Woman066_0070,been something that I'm good at is
Man061_Woman066_0071,getting passed up moving on and now
Man061_Woman066_0072,letting it come back to bite me or to
Man061_Woman066_0073,bite you so I don't think I can think of
Man061_Woman066_0074,the time that you really disappointed me
Man061_Woman066_0075,that is still on my mind how have I
Man061_Woman066_0076,changed since we first met

Man061_Woman066_0085,I've been happy with my answers no I'm
Man061_Woman066_0086,just nervous because I feel like usually
Man061_Woman066_0087,the time your talk about this stuff a
Man061_Woman066_0088,lot just not in front of other people so
Man061_Woman066_0089,I feel like are we ok with the end
Man061_Woman066_0090,compressor running yeah to go over that

Man061_Woman066_0094,first met now you are not as crazy and
Man061_Woman066_0095,all over the place and they think you
Man061_Woman066_0096,have different goals
Man061_Woman066_0097,more like amateur goals realistic goals
Man061_Woman066_0098,realistic goals and you choose your
Man061_Woman066_0099,friends differently
Man061_Woman066_0100,which I like because some of your
Man061_Woman066_0101,friends are bad eggs yeah
Man061_Woman066_0102,[Music]
Man061_Woman066_0103,I don't know I feel like in a way are

Man061_Woman066_0105,and like I don't know it were just
Man061_Woman066_0106,different people now and things are just
Man061_Woman066_0107,different like I don't really miss

Man061_Woman066_0109,get used to her glasses I like doing
Man061_Woman066_0110,even less but it's like other than that
Man061_Woman066_0111,we've just have grown and matured a lot
Man061_Woman066_0112,we're growing together that's what's
Man061_Woman066_0113,different about starting to be in a
Man061_Woman066_0114,relationship so you miss that were
Man061_Woman066_0115,learning from each other's experiences
Man061_Woman066_0116,yeah do you see us getting married yes I
Man061_Woman066_0117,do and when I don't know so it's a big
Man061_Woman066_0118,question you know every time going home
Man061_Woman066_0119,for holidays as you know people are
Man061_Woman066_0120,asking me I get a little nervous about
Man061_Woman066_0121,it yeah you run away I guess I go grab a
Man061_Woman066_0122,beer at that point and you know I just
Man061_Woman066_0123,get away the question but it doesn't
Man061_Woman066_0124,mean that I don't love you you know I
Man061_Woman066_0125,love you it's just you know financial
Man061_Woman066_0126,concerns has always been the big thing
Man061_Woman066_0127,as far as when you get engaged because I
Man061_Woman066_0128,want to be ready for it but you've also
Man061_Woman066_0129,taught me that it's okay to get engaged
Man061_Woman066_0130,early and you don't have to get married
Man061_Woman066_0131,within a year like everybody my family
Man061_Woman066_0132,has done definitely can get engaged and
Man061_Woman066_0133,just be engaged for however many years
Man061_Woman066_0134,doesn't matter so do you see us getting
Man061_Woman066_0135,married yeah eventually he decided made
Man061_Woman066_0136,it clear that you're gonna make the call
Man061_Woman066_0137,but I mean like I said I know I
Man061_Woman066_0138,definitely want to wait to be engaged
Man061_Woman066_0139,until I'm done with grad school okay
Man061_Woman066_0140,yeah yeah you know just definitely just
Man061_Woman066_0141,a money thing but mentioning that
Man061_Woman066_0142,doesn't hold back our feelings for Asia
Man061_Woman066_0143,I know it just it's definitely smart to
Man061_Woman066_0144,wait until this doesn't make sense
Man061_Woman066_0145,blowing money on
Man061_Woman066_0146,if we're together really I like that we
Man061_Woman066_0147,talked about getting married a lot
Man061_Woman066_0148,because it's kind of like almost like we
Man061_Woman066_0149,are engaged because we're just talking
Man061_Woman066_0150,about planning for the future all the
Man061_Woman066_0151,time you're getting ready for it so it
Man061_Woman066_0152,seems like it's just gonna be a ring
Man061_Woman066_0153,finger yeah that's the only difference
Man061_Woman066_0154,I feel like go to freak people out to
Man061_Woman066_0155,say how much we talked about I don't
Man061_Woman066_0156,know if that's normal or not but I'm
Man061_Woman066_0157,okay with it

Man061_Woman066_0169,in public that it's like only on the
Man061_Woman066_0170,rare instance like in public does it

Man061_Woman066_0177,you know acting goofy silly it's just
Man061_Woman066_0178,it's just what you mean when you just
Man061_Woman066_0179,cute but when we're at home and I'm like
Man061_Woman066_0180,studying you're trying to get stuff done
Man061_Woman066_0181,it's like I don't know why I just gave
Man061_Woman066_0182,you it sometimes but that's more
Man061_Woman066_0183,annoying you than embarrassing you know
Man061_Woman066_0184,yes I'm going and embarrassing you just
Man061_Woman066_0185,got to keep you on your toes
Man061_Woman066_0186,yeah I guess I'm really never

Man061_Woman066_0188,rubbed off on me because you don't
Man061_Woman066_0189,really get embarrassed that much but I
Man061_Woman066_0190,used to get embarrassed a lot yeah he's
Man061_Woman066_0191,very easily too and I think that
Man061_Woman066_0192,definitely calmed me down as far as
Man061_Woman066_0193,things like that good I don't get I
Man061_Woman066_0194,don't feel like everybody's watching me
Man061_Woman066_0195,at all times
Man061_Woman066_0196,oh yeah it doesn't matter like if you
Man061_Woman066_0197,are confident in yourself like who cares
Man061_Woman066_0198,and other people think if you want to be
Man061_Woman066_0199,silly an embarrassing go ahead that's
Man061_Woman066_0200,exactly what I mean you're always
Man061_Woman066_0201,telling me that stuff which is always
Man061_Woman066_0202,helping I appreciate it okay who would
Man061_Woman066_0203,struggle more if we broke up that's a
Man061_Woman066_0204,hard question I don't know I I used to
Man061_Woman066_0205,think you would be you would struggle
Man061_Woman066_0206,more just because you've always said
Man061_Woman066_0207,that I am the one and only and that if
Man061_Woman066_0208,we did break up you want to have another
Man061_Woman066_0209,relationship and I think I always used
Man061_Woman066_0210,to think not having that would kind of
Man061_Woman066_0211,scare you but the more I've learned
Man061_Woman066_0212,about you it would also be okay because
Man061_Woman066_0213,you're so independent too if that if we
Man061_Woman066_0214,learn together you know obviously I
Man061_Woman066_0215,don't want to happen yeah
Man061_Woman066_0216,if for some some reason it did happen
Man061_Woman066_0217,I do think you'd be okay too because
Man061_Woman066_0218,you're so independent and I think you
Man061_Woman066_0219,would just go do all the things that you
Man061_Woman066_0220,know being in a relationship with me is
Man061_Woman066_0221,kind of prevented but you have always
Man061_Woman066_0222,told me that it's worth it taking yeah
Man061_Woman066_0223,you know not moving out to California or
Man061_Woman066_0224,not
Man061_Woman066_0225,you know working on a national park
Man061_Woman066_0226,right after school or anything like that
Man061_Woman066_0227,which I know I can and I brought you out
Man061_Woman066_0228,to New York City you wouldn't have come
Man061_Woman066_0229,out here if it wasn't for me so um yeah
Man061_Woman066_0230,maybe my mom would just take care of it
Man061_Woman066_0231,yeah I think you would definitely shed
Man061_Woman066_0232,more tears than I would but I did I
Man061_Woman066_0233,don't know I think it would beat me up
Man061_Woman066_0234,and I think it would just feel like a
Man061_Woman066_0235,border both of us because we have so
Man061_Woman066_0236,much invested already and we just talked
Man061_Woman066_0237,about like you know one year five years
Man061_Woman066_0238,ten years in the future and it feel like
Man061_Woman066_0239,everything will just get derailed yeah I
Man061_Woman066_0240,definitely I would I'm stressed about
Man061_Woman066_0241,what I'm gonna do for the next five
Man061_Woman066_0242,years with you with the teammate I can't
Man061_Woman066_0243,mention with nobody you know I think I
Man061_Woman066_0244,would make some poor decisions not like
Man061_Woman066_0245,bounce any ideas off anybody and I like
Man061_Woman066_0246,having you as the person I'm bouncing
Man061_Woman066_0247,off ideas with because I feel like you
Man061_Woman066_0248,have a level head but in a completely
Man061_Woman066_0249,different way than I do
Man061_Woman066_0250,yeah that's like the way our brains work
Man061_Woman066_0251,is completely different but you know we
Man061_Woman066_0252,also come together in unison yeah he's
Man061_Woman066_0253,off of you - because it's like sometimes
Man061_Woman066_0254,I'll be like way too serious and it's
Man061_Woman066_0255,not gonna just go for it what sort of
Man061_Woman066_0256,thing it happened doesn't work out new
Man061_Woman066_0257,plan yeah and you give that right back
Man061_Woman066_0258,to me because you know I can say it a
Man061_Woman066_0259,lot easier than I actually do it yeah so
Man061_Woman066_0260,yeah I mean if this was a couple of
Man061_Woman066_0261,years ago when we are going through a
Man061_Woman066_0262,tough time maybe that would have that
Man061_Woman066_0263,would have been a very difficult
Man061_Woman066_0264,question to answer but it's cool to you
Man061_Woman066_0265,know ask this to each other and realize
Man061_Woman066_0266,that we're so far past that at this
Man061_Woman066_0267,point yeah we don't it's not even in our
Man061_Woman066_0268,mindset that's good
Man061_Woman066_0269,am I the best sex you've ever had and
Man061_Woman066_0270,you are for me too in case you are
Man061_Woman066_0271,wondering what's the hardest thing about
Man061_Woman066_0272,the relationship
Man061_Woman066_0273,the hardest thing about the relationship
Man061_Woman066_0274,I think you hit the nail on the head the
Man061_Woman066_0275,other day when we were talking about it
Man061_Woman066_0276,it's just like dealing with family
Man061_Woman066_0277,coming in towards us where we know we're
Man061_Woman066_0278,strong together but then when we hear
Man061_Woman066_0279,things from our family and it's not like
Man061_Woman066_0280,they're trying to tear us apart by any
Man061_Woman066_0281,means but it is just you know you're not
Man061_Woman066_0282,getting along with Dan sometimes or you
Man061_Woman066_0283,know not liking the way Sarah comes
Man061_Woman066_0284,across you know anybody else in the
Man061_Woman066_0285,family like some stuff just rubs you the
Man061_Woman066_0286,wrong way you don't like how it how
Man061_Woman066_0287,easygoing we are sometimes like let me
Man061_Woman066_0288,just blow stuff off and don't really
Man061_Woman066_0289,yeah tackle issues be kind of big nor
Man061_Woman066_0290,them my family so I think that's
Man061_Woman066_0291,difficult but that's also you know
Man061_Woman066_0292,within our relationship I have those
Man061_Woman066_0293,problems do that's rubbed off on me all
Man061_Woman066_0294,my life being with you know a family
Man061_Woman066_0295,that's like that so yeah I think that
Man061_Woman066_0296,you know slows us down sometimes I mean
Man061_Woman066_0297,don't make it sound like it's just me
Man061_Woman066_0298,having a problem with their family
Man061_Woman066_0299,because I know my family yeah I'm angry
Man061_Woman066_0300,but do you think that's our only problem
Man061_Woman066_0301,or do you think that outside forces
Man061_Woman066_0302,coming in Yahoo I think within us like
Man061_Woman066_0303,money's the biggest thing and it's like
Man061_Woman066_0304,so obnoxious because it's like so beyond
Man061_Woman066_0305,their control look I feel like the
Man061_Woman066_0306,things we can control like emotional
Man061_Woman066_0307,things or physical things like we're
Man061_Woman066_0308,really good at handling and not only as
Man061_Woman066_0309,individuals but as a couple but like it
Man061_Woman066_0310,really sucks that we have like all these
Man061_Woman066_0311,big plans and it's just like riding on
Man061_Woman066_0312,money yeah like this big move that we
Man061_Woman066_0313,have coming up is gonna be yeah that's
Man061_Woman066_0314,gonna be a big test for us to see if we
Man061_Woman066_0315,can just you know take those next couple
Man061_Woman066_0316,of years to save money and then move on
Man061_Woman066_0317,with our life because
Man061_Woman066_0318,I feel like we're in between steps you
Man061_Woman066_0319,know I mean we we did this experience
Man061_Woman066_0320,and we're ready for the next one but we
Man061_Woman066_0321,got to take a breather and get ready for
Man061_Woman066_0322,that next step but yeah money is awful I
Man061_Woman066_0323,think it's ruining us
Man061_Woman066_0324,that's not ruining us it's just yeah but
Man061_Woman066_0325,we are just so eager to buy a house to
Man061_Woman066_0326,do all that stuff and we're always
Man061_Woman066_0327,talking about it and thinking about all
Man061_Woman066_0328,the improvements we're gonna do on the
Man061_Woman066_0329,house yeah but I won't either pretty
Man061_Woman066_0330,soon yeah but it's a risk that I'm lying
Man061_Woman066_0331,the take for a better future for us I
Man061_Woman066_0332,hate that I'm gonna be leaving my job
Man061_Woman066_0333,just because it's stable but I just I
Man061_Woman066_0334,just have yeah I just have a hard time
Man061_Woman066_0335,with like big changes and that's why it
Man061_Woman066_0336,stresses me out but I think it's
Man061_Woman066_0337,definitely gonna be worth it I know but
Man061_Woman066_0338,I just don't know we have like this
Man061_Woman066_0339,timeline in her head of like Oh wouldn't
Man061_Woman066_0340,this be on so we could have this by then
Man061_Woman066_0341,and that by this time and all this stuff
Man061_Woman066_0342,and it's like if the finances don't line
Man061_Woman066_0343,up then it just gets pushed back right
Man061_Woman066_0344,now that's scary yeah yeah how long is
Man061_Woman066_0345,it gonna actually push back till we can
Man061_Woman066_0346,actually get ahead okay my coat on my
Man061_Woman066_0347,left breathing yeah or you can use my
Man061_Woman066_0348,black hoodie oh yes gonna be less
Man061_Woman066_0349,noticeable
Man061_Woman066_0350,I'm like triangle okay chattering sorry
Man061_Woman066_0351,I'm glad it's cold if it was why yeah
Man061_Woman066_0352,what is our biggest challenge as a
Man061_Woman066_0353,couple well finances but also to I think
Man061_Woman066_0354,sometimes when we get like worked up or
Man061_Woman066_0355,stressed out or whatever there's not
Man061_Woman066_0356,that we're miscommunicating but like I
Man061_Woman066_0357,know I try really hard to get my point
Man061_Woman066_0358,across and I feel like sometimes it just
Man061_Woman066_0359,falls to deaf ears and I know that
Man061_Woman066_0360,sometimes when you try to talk sense
Man061_Woman066_0361,into me like I just don't want to hear
Man061_Woman066_0362,it because I'm like so involved in my
Man061_Woman066_0363,own headspace and I think sometimes like
Man061_Woman066_0364,that's the biggest challenge is letting
Man061_Woman066_0365,the other person in cuz then the second
Man061_Woman066_0366,like you let me in or I let you and done
Man061_Woman066_0367,it's like instantly resolved mm-hmm I
Man061_Woman066_0368,just wish sometimes I could happen
Man061_Woman066_0369,sooner like hearing each other out and
Man061_Woman066_0370,arguments and not just and just say like
Man061_Woman066_0371,I mean that's like that's just but
Man061_Woman066_0372,without actually understanding they're
Man061_Woman066_0373,like just say that keep hammering you're
Man061_Woman066_0374,like my pointer you're playing yeah and
Man061_Woman066_0375,it's it's funny because this we feel
Man061_Woman066_0376,like the other person's not paying
Man061_Woman066_0377,attention or listening when the actual
Man061_Woman066_0378,arguments happening yeah but then as
Man061_Woman066_0379,soon as it's over and we cool off you
Man061_Woman066_0380,know five minutes later when we just
Man061_Woman066_0381,talk about it
Man061_Woman066_0382,we understand where each other are
Man061_Woman066_0383,coming from and if we don't then we can
Man061_Woman066_0384,just clear everything up which is
Man061_Woman066_0385,something that is pretty cool I think
Man061_Woman066_0386,because we used to argue for like up to
Man061_Woman066_0387,an hour yeah exactly
Man061_Woman066_0388,yeah I agree and now it's just like we
Man061_Woman066_0389,can have a five-minute aggression
Man061_Woman066_0390,overload but then we're just once we get
Man061_Woman066_0391,it out we are fine I'm not saying I like
Man061_Woman066_0392,arguing but I like the way we argued way
Man061_Woman066_0393,better than we used to
Man061_Woman066_0394,I obviously never want to argue but it
Man061_Woman066_0395,happens its life you know what would you
Man061_Woman066_0396,do if I cheated on you I would break up
Man061_Woman066_0397,with you do you know where I'm coming
Man061_Woman066_0398,from with recent relationships or past
Man061_Woman066_0399,relationships sorry and you know how
Man061_Woman066_0400,much that affected me
Man061_Woman066_0401,yeah and how long it took me to get over
Man061_Woman066_0402,that stuff and that I gave it another
Man061_Woman066_0403,chance and it just made things worse I
Man061_Woman066_0404,know you wouldn't do it to me Matt I
Man061_Woman066_0405,mean you asked the question I yeah I
Man061_Woman066_0406,don't think I don't the reason I would
Man061_Woman066_0407,break up with you is because I don't
Man061_Woman066_0408,think I could ever forgive you as bad as
Man061_Woman066_0409,that sounds I just know from the past
Man061_Woman066_0410,that I could never forgive somebody for
Man061_Woman066_0411,doing that because I'll never understand
Man061_Woman066_0412,me because I would never do that to you
Man061_Woman066_0413,so if maybe if I had done it to anybody
Man061_Woman066_0414,in my life that would be one thing but
Man061_Woman066_0415,since I haven't then I don't understand
Man061_Woman066_0416,I mean what you're saying I feel like if
Man061_Woman066_0417,there's ever someone to cheat it would
Man061_Woman066_0418,be you mm-hm
Man061_Woman066_0419,why because I think alcohol would be
Man061_Woman066_0420,involved and I just think you would just
Man061_Woman066_0421,get drunk and you know not like Oh what
Man061_Woman066_0422,are you gonna say drunken Tina
Man061_Woman066_0423,you're like no but I just feel like I'm
Man061_Woman066_0424,more aware of things do you think it
Man061_Woman066_0425,would be me going after it or do you
Man061_Woman066_0426,think like it's a girl was like really
Man061_Woman066_0427,hitting on me hard oh this is weird this
Man061_Woman066_0428,has never happened because I don't think
Man061_Woman066_0429,I would be going after it because when I
Man061_Woman066_0430,go out drinking uh stuff I just want to
Man061_Woman066_0431,hang out with guys and like joke around
Man061_Woman066_0432,and get all my bad jokes out so you have
Man061_Woman066_0433,to deal with it at home you know I think
Man061_Woman066_0434,that well the person I am like if I ever
Man061_Woman066_0435,felt that urge to be involved with
Man061_Woman066_0436,another guy or something like that I
Man061_Woman066_0437,would just be like hey listen this is
Man061_Woman066_0438,working out like I would never do that
Man061_Woman066_0439,to someone especially you be had yeah
Man061_Woman066_0440,like I even if we weren't in a good
Man061_Woman066_0441,place
Man061_Woman066_0442,I'm like way too much respect for you
Man061_Woman066_0443,just as like a human being said okay not
Man061_Woman066_0444,yeah it would be discussed before it
Man061_Woman066_0445,would even have a chance to happen I
Man061_Woman066_0446,feel like yeah we're two specially after
Man061_Woman066_0447,what you went through like to invest and
Man061_Woman066_0448,you know how do I take you for granted
Man061_Woman066_0449,really worked up I just I don't think
Man061_Woman066_0450,you really take me for granted I think
Man061_Woman066_0451,sometimes you you forget to realize like
Man061_Woman066_0452,what I've done to come out here and like
Man061_Woman066_0453,what I've given up to come
Man061_Woman066_0454,here but like I don't hold it against
Man061_Woman066_0455,you I just I wish you'd I wish I was in
Man061_Woman066_0456,the forefront more because I feel like I
Man061_Woman066_0457,did a complete 180 like in my life and
Man061_Woman066_0458,in my mindset too I wanted to be to like
Man061_Woman066_0459,come out here with you and I feel like
Man061_Woman066_0460,that gives you a little bit of leverage
Man061_Woman066_0461,in the relationship but like I don't
Man061_Woman066_0462,think you take me for granted I think I
Man061_Woman066_0463,had a lot more leverage before but now
Man061_Woman066_0464,that we're both like we want to get out
Man061_Woman066_0465,of here I feel like we're cool on that
Man061_Woman066_0466,but you know I mean the rides and stuff
Man061_Woman066_0467,don't it's out in that air but they
Man061_Woman066_0468,shouldn't it's my friends no no it's not
Man061_Woman066_0469,so much anymore but just like when you
Man061_Woman066_0470,would say I'm not being there for you
Man061_Woman066_0471,and you know listening to or
Man061_Woman066_0472,understanding your feelings are like
Man061_Woman066_0473,caring for you I think that is something
Man061_Woman066_0474,that you take for granted because you
Man061_Woman066_0475,know I'm always there yeah I know I was
Man061_Woman066_0476,there I think a lot of that was like
Man061_Woman066_0477,through counseling I've learned like
Man061_Woman066_0478,that was your way of like being there
Man061_Woman066_0479,for me and comforting me and like doing
Man061_Woman066_0480,things for me but it just wasn't up to
Man061_Woman066_0481,my expectations it's not that like I was
Man061_Woman066_0482,taking those things for granted life you
Man061_Woman066_0483,would do that and just wasn't what I was
Man061_Woman066_0484,expecting
Man061_Woman066_0485,yes it seemed like it wasn't happening
Man061_Woman066_0486,and now I've learned that like that's
Man061_Woman066_0487,what you're offering and that's what you
Man061_Woman066_0488,have to give and I need to appreciate it
Man061_Woman066_0489,would you think it's changed since then
Man061_Woman066_0490,yes yeah I think that's what's changed
Man061_Woman066_0491,absolutely
Man061_Woman066_0492,okay how much porn do you watch really
Man061_Woman066_0493,period I don't watch porn I sometimes
Man061_Woman066_0494,I'll see some like a Sports Illustrated
Man061_Woman066_0495,swimsuit pictures that are pretty nice
Man061_Woman066_0496,but I know a joke actively searching or
Man061_Woman066_0497,anything like that what about you no but
Man061_Woman066_0498,yeah we kind of came to that agreement
Man061_Woman066_0499,that we once we got the opponent or
Man061_Woman066_0500,relationships that we just kind of
Man061_Woman066_0501,wanted to have I think once we started
Man061_Woman066_0502,living together and live work one
Man061_Woman066_0503,distance it doesn't really make much
Man061_Woman066_0504,sense to be yeah and it was also like
Man061_Woman066_0505,yeah we want to provide that for each
Man061_Woman066_0506,other we don't want to have to look to
Man061_Woman066_0507,other outlets cuz that's what I feel
Man061_Woman066_0508,leads to the cheating thing and that's
Man061_Woman066_0509,why I think it's easy for us not to you
Man061_Woman066_0510,know watch porn because we can you know
Man061_Woman066_0511,we just look for each other in that do
Man061_Woman066_0512,you agree I never really thought about
Man061_Woman066_0513,it like leading to a cheating thing but
Man061_Woman066_0514,I think I mean if you're watching if
Man061_Woman066_0515,you're if you're watching porn you're
Man061_Woman066_0516,going somewhere else to satisfy those
Man061_Woman066_0517,needs I feel and I feel like if you can
Man061_Woman066_0518,do it virtually behind somebody's back
Man061_Woman066_0519,then you can do it physically behind
Man061_Woman066_0520,somebody's back and I mean so that's why
Man061_Woman066_0521,I feel like it would lead to that and
Man061_Woman066_0522,that's why I don't think it is good for
Man061_Woman066_0523,relationships except except Sports
Man061_Woman066_0524,Illustrated sometimes it's you like
Man061_Woman066_0525,looking at like you you like cuz I like
Man061_Woman066_0526,your Leonardo DiCaprio's and you're you
Man061_Woman066_0527,know big movie stars and stuff like that
Man061_Woman066_0528,and I like you know
Man061_Woman066_0529,yeah because I used to have the app when
Man061_Woman066_0530,we started dating I can't read this
Man061_Woman066_0531,okay I get that once I think it applies
Man061_Woman066_0532,or skipping that one yeah they kind of
Man061_Woman066_0533,have you ever chosen porn over me yeah
Man061_Woman066_0534,we kind of fun am it a way to make it
Man061_Woman066_0535,work yeah I'm very long distance what do
Man061_Woman066_0536,you think is the next step in my
Man061_Woman066_0537,relationship
Man061_Woman066_0538,well moving to Buffalo saving some money
Man061_Woman066_0539,and figuring out where you're gonna go
Man061_Woman066_0540,to school there PhD hopefully yeah where
Man061_Woman066_0541,you can you know after you get some
Man061_Woman066_0542,applications well I was obviously
Man061_Woman066_0543,getting engaged at some point um
Man061_Woman066_0544,hopefully before the HD program starts
Man061_Woman066_0545,yeah before going back to school I hope
Man061_Woman066_0546,to be engaged not married because we
Man061_Woman066_0547,won't be ready for it but financially it
Man061_Woman066_0548,won't be ready or time that's like it
Man061_Woman066_0549,yeah yeah we need this next couple years
Man061_Woman066_0550,yeah absolutely I think it's gonna bring
Man061_Woman066_0551,a lot of extra smiles into our
Man061_Woman066_0552,relationship I think we have a lot of
Man061_Woman066_0553,happiness but I think a dog is really
Man061_Woman066_0554,gonna bring us closer and make us
Man061_Woman066_0555,happier as far as just a family kind of
Man061_Woman066_0556,thing you know yeah and I feel like in
Man061_Woman066_0557,our relationship
Man061_Woman066_0558,you know where you're always looking out
Man061_Woman066_0559,for each other and stuff
Man061_Woman066_0560,you know that you know like through
Man061_Woman066_0561,counseling stuff like I've been looking
Man061_Woman066_0562,out for myself I really wish that you
Man061_Woman066_0563,could do that for yourself like you know
Man061_Woman066_0564,we definitely are constantly working on
Man061_Woman066_0565,ourselves says like a couple I feel like
Man061_Woman066_0566,I work on myself a lot with help as an
Man061_Woman066_0567,individual I know you do things to
Man061_Woman066_0568,individually but I feel like if you talk
Man061_Woman066_0569,to someone you could get even better
Man061_Woman066_0570,insight on yourself and what's going on
Man061_Woman066_0571,and I'm not I think it would just
Man061_Woman066_0572,transcend like everything work
Man061_Woman066_0573,relationships family life like I just
Man061_Woman066_0574,think you would benefit and I'm not
Man061_Woman066_0575,opposed to it I'm just lazy about it I
Man061_Woman066_0576,know that's that's what's so frustrating
Man061_Woman066_0577,because we always talk about it on the
Man061_Woman066_0578,weekends yeah well me going yeah about
Man061_Woman066_0579,me going to a counselor but it's like I
Man061_Woman066_0580,can't call it set up an appointment
Man061_Woman066_0581,right now because it's the weekend and
Man061_Woman066_0582,they're not open I'm gonna just pushes
Man061_Woman066_0583,another week so when you're young that's
Man061_Woman066_0584,the time to like be like yeah I am
Man061_Woman066_0585,making mistakes or yeah I will throw
Man061_Woman066_0586,myself like whole-hearted into this cuz
Man061_Woman066_0587,only good can come from it and I know I
Man061_Woman066_0588,just really think seeing how much I've
Man061_Woman066_0589,been I thought benefited from it I can't
Man061_Woman066_0590,believe that you weren't like sign me up
Man061_Woman066_0591,yeah I know
Man061_Woman066_0592,and I well and I know how much I benefit
Man061_Woman066_0593,from it too from when I was counseling
Man061_Woman066_0594,in college yeah you gotta help me a lot
Man061_Woman066_0595,through some hard times so and I think
Man061_Woman066_0596,it's gonna be important to when we move
Man061_Woman066_0597,home to not like just get my advice from
Man061_Woman066_0598,Dan don't let our family specialist in
Man061_Woman066_0599,one direction yeah you know yeah and if
Man061_Woman066_0600,they do to talk about it and not just
Man061_Woman066_0601,like let it fester like something that's
Man061_Woman066_0602,like somebody makes a comment don't let
Man061_Woman066_0603,it just sit and sit just talk about it
Man061_Woman066_0604,be like yeah that really rubs me the
Man061_Woman066_0605,wrong way in here yeah if I say
Man061_Woman066_0606,something so yeah our communication
Man061_Woman066_0607,could definitely improve too in our
Man061_Woman066_0608,relationship yeah
Man061_Woman066_0609,maybe most mostly my emotions because I
Man061_Woman066_0610,feel like you tell me your emotions a
Man061_Woman066_0611,lot but I'm just like it was like I just
Man061_Woman066_0612,kind of coupe it up and don't think
Man061_Woman066_0613,there's time for it
Man061_Woman066_0614,so there wouldn't be something I'd like
Man061_Woman066_0615,to help I think it would help our
Man061_Woman066_0616,relationship anymore yeah but I think it
Man061_Woman066_0617,would really just help you it would help
Man061_Woman066_0618,ya help me and us I know cuz you remind
Man061_Woman066_0619,me of things when I actually talk to you
Man061_Woman066_0620,about them and you'll bring it up like
Man061_Woman066_0621,next time it happens you know in real
Man061_Woman066_0622,time you'll tell me like you're you you
Man061_Woman066_0623,know what this problem is you've done
Man061_Woman066_0624,this before they remember this is what
Man061_Woman066_0625,you said you wanted to do to fix it in
Man061_Woman066_0626,and it always helps so I think if I
Man061_Woman066_0627,boost my thoughts and emotions more it
Man061_Woman066_0628,would that's why I think it would help
Man061_Woman066_0629,us
Man061_Woman066_0630,how do you feel after this conversation
Man061_Woman066_0631,okay I feel like a lot of it is stuff
Man061_Woman066_0632,we've talked about before there's a
Man061_Woman066_0633,couple questions that like I think a
Man061_Woman066_0634,couple years ago would have like really
Man061_Woman066_0635,upset me and we probably left and it
Man061_Woman066_0636,would have been like I don't feel like
Man061_Woman066_0637,I'm second-guessing all these things but
Man061_Woman066_0638,I feel like this was a good experience
