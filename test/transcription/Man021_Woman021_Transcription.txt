Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0033,you and you having the right seat maybe

Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0050,people don't have that up like in their
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0051,relationships that they have photos of
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0052,themselves and multiple photos of

Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0059,different yeah we're completely
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0060,different I love that we but we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0061,compromise yeah I love that you know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0062,like like we balance each other but I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0063,get like I can be emotional when you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0064,more crowded or you'll be functional and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0065,I'm more grounded except if we're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0066,watching up well I mean you you have to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0067,be soulless it didn't I hate my job
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0068,cannot cry from the first time I that's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0069,and I like that I can joke like that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0070,with with with someone like you yeah
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0071,that's what I love
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0072,how do you describe me to others
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0073,I tell people think of me and think of
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0074,the opposite and there you go no I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0075,usually say that you're like um like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0076,this punk guy with all these tattoos
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0077,they're all very colorful and then it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0078,usually leads to a follow-up of like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0079,what kind of tattoos does he have are
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0080,they dark or this and I'm like there's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0081,super dark they're all Nintendo and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0082,Disney and and superest areas of what do
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0083,you say oh there were the complete polar
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0084,opposite that you're a theater major
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0085,that I pretty much emphasize all of your
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0086,achievements that you went so far as to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0087,working at FIU and the place that you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0088,at now that I pretty much anything that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0089,is going on in your life at that moment
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0090,you're the topic because it's so much
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0091,easier to talk about something that I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0092,know and that I'm proud of rather than
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0093,just making chitchat and small talk
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0094,about things that I don't really care
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0095,about because I hate a lot of people
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0096,that I know thank you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0097,what are you hesitant to tell me nothing
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0098,really I've always been open with you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0099,the only thing that was scary for me to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0100,tell you I've already spoken with you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0101,about and that's the internship program
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0102,that's it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0103,but we can work through that yeah I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0104,guess it's about the same I think that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0105,like it's not really that I'm hesitant
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0106,to tell you it's more like I'm hesitant
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0107,to have the conversation because it's a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0108,conversation about you know like what
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0109,happens past this moment you know we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0110,like with our relationship it's always
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0111,been you know a conscious effort to be
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0112,present in today and to like worry about
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0113,tomorrow tomorrow and we've built so
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0114,much already that one now that adulthood
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0115,is rolling in and things are gonna
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0116,change and like I'm growing and you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0117,growing and and we're gonna get to a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0118,point where you know you are gonna start
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0119,doing stuff in your field and you are
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0120,gonna start like going and touring and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0121,hopefully that's cuz that's what you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0122,want to do and that to me is scary it's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0123,very very scary it's nothing that we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0124,can't work out I agree but it doesn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0125,make it less scary
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0126,where do you think I may fail you where
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0127,you may fail me yeah
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0128,I don't want to give like a joke answer
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0129,I'm like I don't like here to fail me
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0130,but I mean if I had to think about I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0131,think I think that it I don't know I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0132,don't think I'll really ever fail me I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0133,don't know if that's the right that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0134,that's a question for how like like if
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0135,the question is supposed to be like what
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0136,are my future concerns or like what's a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0137,future concern that I would have about
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0138,you I think it would be that that I hope
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0139,that this is that this path that you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0140,on for for what you're doing now is
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0141,really the path that will make you happy
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0142,because it's it's not a real failure -
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0143,to me it's only a fail it's a failure to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0144,us if it's not because you know we'll
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0145,get to a point where you will have to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0146,make a new choice if that if this isn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0147,what you want right and you know we're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0148,in this together and and we're gonna
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0149,anticipate that kind of tug-of-war
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0150,you know you know to try to help the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0151,other get through and and I don't think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0152,it's really that you'll fail if it's I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0153,think I just pray that this is what will
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0154,make you happy as as a professional what
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0155,you I can't I don't want to answer a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0156,joking but really everything that you've
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0157,done you've never failed me and I don't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0158,really see you ever failing me it is but
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0159,I'm also really happy
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0160,to just carry a question when you think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0161,about it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0162,what is the sexual fantasy you're afraid
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0163,to ask me you already know everything
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0164,there's nothing that I haven't already
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0165,asked for it well I really I want to be
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0166,it's funny cuz I don't think I've ever
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0167,told you that I have the same fantasy
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0168,but in the other way like I want to be
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0169,the submissive one okay I do I want to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0170,be I just want to be like taken no I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0171,told him
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0172,who has more power in this relationship
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0173,you or me I think I do
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0174,you're the level-headed one really at
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0175,times but anytime that it's time to pay
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0176,for pills I'm usually the one on top of
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0177,that I think I'm the more like assertive
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0178,she's kind of even do you really think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0179,about it yeah because the truth is it's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0180,not really like like that you back down
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0181,to me or I back down to you I think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0182,we're just both very like independent
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0183,thinkers you know that just made this
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0184,decision to compromise we always present
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0185,the problems on the table and then we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0186,take it from there yeah and I'm probably
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0187,but I'm probably the more like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0188,emotionally driven one so none of my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0189,like like this like this morning this
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0190,morning when um when you came in and and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0191,I was like and I was like because I was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0192,taking Lila nothing know that you were
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0193,like the you let Lila jump on to the bed
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0194,and I was it is but not this morning
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0195,this morning it was painful I didn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0196,sleep at all like Oh last night Lila was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0197,very warm and being hungover as Lila
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0198,usually is thankfully because I mean
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0199,she's alive you know that question
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0200,wait is your turn your turn I just
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0201,finished reading it who sacrifices more
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0202,in our relationship and how do you feel
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0203,about that I feel that I do sometimes
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0204,more now because I'm in school and my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0205,work schedule and also that before I was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0206,taking up the second job so you like you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0207,take the most sacrifices at this moment
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0208,but not to say that you don't it's more
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0209,who has a more inconvenient schedule
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0210,well Mack is I think I'm the one who
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0211,gives somewhere has most high prices
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0212,towards our responsibilities because you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0213,are doing all these things okay and like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0214,you're you are you know with with the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0215,department and then you're in schedule
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0216,and you're lucky that's scheduled I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0217,think because my schedule is so much
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0218,more kind of like standard now that you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0219,like I since I spend so much more time
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0220,alone than I used to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0221,dad and you're off doing something else
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0222,it's not like you're off gallivanting
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0223,but you are doing something like you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0224,actively in something and I'm actively
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0225,like catching up on once upon time like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0226,which is fun but it is kind of like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0227,isn't it is kind of a sacrifice now
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0228,especially with with Lila and and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0229,knowing mentally everything that you've
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0230,done and I do you you know she's a happy
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0231,dog but she is a responsibility that's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0232,beyond both of ours like like she needs
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0233,more from us then then what our
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0234,schedules allow us to do sometimes so
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0235,I feel like we're so square okay
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0236,are you sexually satisfied I could have
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0237,more sex I could have all the more sex
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0238,okay so you can get on that whenever you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0239,whatever you want I do feel like we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0240,should Hughes that googlies outside yeah
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0241,but I agree but do you agree because you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0242,want more sex or you just agree like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0243,more sex is fine no I agree because yeah
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0244,more sex I tried it on my calendar
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0245,if your biggest secret was a film what
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0246,would the title be
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0247,regrets from Gainesville
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0248,no that would be a misleading I was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0249,gonna say Secret Diary of a call girl
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0250,no but then I'm not a call girl so
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0251,that's not I got a better one from
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0252,Gainesville with love specs you can
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0253,sound like you murdered people that is
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0254,it my turn yeah thank you dude
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0255,what's the pain in me you'd like to heal
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0256,I think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0257,you're a distrust about Lake
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0258,you've never told me that it was you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0259,know you never told me like the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0260,emotional effect that your father's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0261,absence had on you I think that you know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0262,you've always been very positive about
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0263,how your grandfather became that and I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0264,remember when we when we first started
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0265,dating and you told me how you changed
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0266,how you legally changed your last name
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0267,and going through that process at a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0268,young age and like doing it yourself
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0269,like I've always admired how like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0270,forthcoming and strong you you you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0271,perceive yourself and how like Punk you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0272,kind of are cuz you just were like fuck
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0273,this guy whatever but I think that that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0274,you know a father so especially when you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0275,have a chance to know who he is like if
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0276,it wasn't for the fact that you if you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0277,if you'd never known your dad that would
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0278,be a different story you would just know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0279,your grandfather and that's it but I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0280,know that you did have some memories
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0281,with your dad and that it wasn't very
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0282,healthy it wasn't am I wrong mm-hm
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0283,I mean it was about a year but then
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0284,again who really remembers anything when
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0285,you're one years old
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0286,but like never like he never talks about
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0287,it with your mom it was never we had a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0288,discussion but it wasn't really she just
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0289,made sure to say that he's not here and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0290,I'm here and he knows where you are but
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0291,he's not making the effort so I took it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0292,as it is it was literally black and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0293,white that if he didn't want to be a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0294,part of my life why would I want to let
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0295,him and after all these years I think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0296,that like it did it'd be give it that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0297,stemmed what you have become not in like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0298,a bad way at all no but it definitely
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0299,influenced I totally agree because I see
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0300,my stepbrothers and stepsisters are like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0301,popping out kids left and right and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0302,doing drugs in and out of jail like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0303,and the only reason I bring that up is
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0304,because they still have a connection
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0305,with my father so obviously something in
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0306,that side of the family wasn't going on
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0307,like doing anything good and I try to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0308,stay as clear away from that as possible
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0309,I had my opportunity to have a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0310,relationship with my sister when I was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0311,in high school had no interest in it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0312,like you I tried no I tried I tried and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0313,the thing was that it was more of a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0314,drama show and I thought that I was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0315,trying to more take care of her because
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0316,she was in one of my classes and she was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0317,pregnant at the time and pretty much the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0318,teach would be picky on her or whatever
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0319,it was just a total nightmare
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0320,it was everything that you could imagine
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0321,that I like someone with no class would
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0322,would bring to school like in a way it's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0323,like it makes sense why sometimes you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0324,more defensive and and stuff like you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0325,become defensive about things that to me
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0326,are like of all the all it's so trivial
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0327,stuff like it's like it's such a trivial
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0328,argument to have and to defend and you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0329,get so about it and I think that it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0330,comes from something that happened to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0331,you before or like a series of things
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0332,that happened to you as a kid that I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0333,might not really know about it's more
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0334,growing up with Eric everything had I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0335,had to be defensive because any moment
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0336,he could snap or my mom could snap so I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0337,didn't really that's why I'm trying to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0338,calm down you know now that I know that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0339,like we're talking about this out loud I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0340,think that if I if there was a hurt that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0341,I would I can fix in you would have been
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0342,your
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0343,your feelings of abandonment because you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0344,get like that about your friends
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0345,like when like like when when Stephanie
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0346,or George or like if when when somebody
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0347,just like doesn't isn't consistently a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0348,part of your life the way you want them
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0349,to be it is your instinct to just like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0350,fuck them forget them they're horrible
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0351,people I don't want to be their friend
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0352,anymore and I always feel like I have to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0353,pull you back in and be like you gotta
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0354,you gotta be sensible you know but you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0355,people are people we're all growing up
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0356,we all have our own lives and that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0357,doesn't mean that they don't love you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0358,that doesn't mean no no you know and I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0359,do feel that I think that you like that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0360,you're scared of someone going away but
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0361,you'll but you know that you'll be fine
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0362,because you know that you can just like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0363,fuck them all like you can just like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0364,move on and I feel like it's okay to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0365,it's okay to let go peacefully instead
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0366,of with such like you if they're like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0367,like I'm dramatic but when that's that's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0368,your moment of like fuck this isn't set
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0369,the fires to the stuff you know and I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0370,think it could be calmer
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0371,is there anything that you think tie
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0372,that you would want to fix with me
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0373,I can't really think of anything I mean
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0374,I was gonna say your relationship with
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0375,your dad but you're still actively
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0376,seeing your dad but more that you should
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0377,see him a little bit more often so he
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0378,doesn't have to call you you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0379,and pretty much guilt trip you into
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0380,coming in if I was to fix one thing it's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0381,more that I don't feel that your dad has
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0382,the right to call you and pretty much
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0383,guilt trip you into making you come in
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0384,rather than inviting you to a place
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0385,because it's two very different things I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0386,mean when he puts your brother and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0387,sister on the phone he's purposely doing
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0388,that to bring you closer and it's more
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0389,the thing that Jessica and and your dad
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0390,are saying the jokes about like that I'm
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0391,the one holding you back I'm the one
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0392,trying to let you go over there I really
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0393,am I'm I'm really conflicted about what
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0394,my feelings are toward my it's like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0395,family situation yeah I feel like I try
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0396,but like they don't see that they are
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0397,just saying that you're coming and going
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0398,as you please when they need to realize
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0399,that you're an adult now that you have
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0400,responsibilities but the they're always
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0401,gonna look at you as that teenager
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0402,yeah and I've just come to accept that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0403,there's not really a whole lot of like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0404,it doesn't matter how if I get a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0405,master's degree or if I make forty four
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0406,thousand dollars a year or have my own
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0407,place or have my own dog or I'm engaged
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0408,you're always gonna be that little kid I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0409,am and I think like I think that my dad
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0410,just feels really guilty about how
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0411,I grew up like I feel like he now that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0412,he's older feels more guilty about the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0413,way that we like his involvement in my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0414,life that he couldn't control because he
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0415,has he has Olli and Angie now and now
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0416,that's like his real opportunity to be a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0417,full-time dad you know and he had I mean
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0418,all these oldest but I'm me and holier
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0419,like 16 17 years apart you're talking
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0420,about a man who sees he sees me as his
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0421,child his first child but I know that it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0422,killed him to not be like a father all
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0423,the time to me and he just didn't have
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0424,his shit together for a really long time
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0425,I mean he's a good dad yeah he's a very
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0426,good dad but you know sometimes it's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0427,it's hard because like I feel are you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0428,ever gonna have that conversation with
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0429,him with what time just pull him aside
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0430,it's a conversation I've wanted to have
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0431,since I was like 13 years old you know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0432,like so don't you think it's a little
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0433,bit overdue it's it's really just
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0434,because it's a conversation that would
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0435,never be accessible like I could never
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0436,go up to my dad and this was this was my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0437,problem a lot at the time when we were
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0438,growing up before before Julian and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0439,Angie were born it was like I couldn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0440,have one-on-one time at all really
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0441,rarely would I have one-on-one time with
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0442,him that's why me and Jessica always had
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0443,like I had one-on-one time with him you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0444,did it's easy just pull him over to the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0445,side you tell Angie and Uli I need to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0446,have a word with dad yeah but he did
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0447,that in the course of a liquor trip
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0448,I seize the opportunity that's it wasn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0449,even about going to the liquor store
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0450,it was seizing the opportunity to just
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0451,get in I feel like now I'm not trying to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0452,defend my actions I'm not proud of the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0453,fact that I haven't had that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0454,conversation I think that in a way
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0455,because I guess I see a lot of me in my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0456,dad and a lot of me and my mom but I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0457,know that I'm more like my mom that I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0458,don't want to interfere with with with
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0459,the kind of dad that he can be to Angie
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0460,no Lee no he wouldn't be changing the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0461,way that he's acting towards them it's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0462,more about and it's not about being
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0463,selfish but it's more that you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0464,finally opening up well yeah but what
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0465,I'm saying is like I feel like I'm done
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0466,like I feel like like a father is never
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0467,done with his daughter or with his child
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0468,you know like I feel but I do feel like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0469,and a lot of this has to do with Manny
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0470,like I have Manny I have my stepfather
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0471,you know and and he filled a lot of the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0472,fatherly void that I didn't get from my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0473,dad when he was building a whole new
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0474,family so I don't feel like I'm lacking
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0475,in a parental figure like I don't feel
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0476,like I feel like I have that that bad
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0477,already like I get something from Manny
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0478,and I get something from my father I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0479,just don't want you to feel that you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0480,holding back anything
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0481,what are you worried could end our
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0482,relationship
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0483,jealousy and I don't think that I'd give
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0484,you any reason to think that there are
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0485,times that whenever I make friends that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0486,are girls you automatically assume that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0487,I'm attracted to them and even though
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0488,they might be attractive it doesn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0489,necessarily mean that I'm going to go
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0490,out of my way and do anything with them
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0491,because as I stated before I have more
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0492,invested on the inside then for me to go
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0493,out and have one night of fun and ruin
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0494,all of that for everything that I've
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0495,built up well you know I do I'm the same
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0496,threat as you think that would be so you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0497,know I think it's cool how opposite we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0498,are but I also am realistic and the fact
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0499,that we are that opposite and that our
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0500,interests are so different that um I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0501,can't help be concerned in some ways
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0502,when you when there is a girl who sort
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0503,of looks similar to me physically but
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0504,does have all the tattoos and does
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0505,listen to Alkaline Trio and does know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0506,every blink-182 lyric or knows how to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0507,play all the like you can she can beat
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0508,you at Excitebike and whip your ass and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0509,Smash Brothers and I can only go so far
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0510,and invest time into learning how to do
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0511,all these properly but at the end of the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0512,day it's like I can I it's it does make
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0513,me feel a little insecure and I know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0514,that it's my thing it's nothing you're
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0515,giving me you're not giving me anything
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0516,that's telling me that I should feel
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0517,that way but I see them and then I and I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0518,see like how could he not like I think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0519,she's beautiful and she does have the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0520,balls to cover her arms and sleeves she
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0521,does have the balls to like get in the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0522,mosh
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0523,and fucking get duped in the face and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0524,like comes out bloody
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0525,oh you know I can't do that because like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0526,you know cuz I'm Christian and and I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0527,feel like there's gonna like my fear is
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0528,really that there's gonna come a point
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0529,where you'll be bored with with with it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0530,like this when you know that people who
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0531,are more attracted to things that you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0532,like exist because of you five years ago
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0533,I didn't know what I was doing with my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0534,life
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0535,you pretty much let me open up the doors
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0536,to FIU and showed me what I want to do
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0537,so I have you to thank for that so for
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0538,you to think that I'm ever gonna get
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0539,bored is ridiculous
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0540,didn't who loves whom or in this
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0541,relationship I think it goes like this
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0542,yeah I think when I like when when you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0543,love me the most is when I'm like God
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0544,when I love you the most really I don't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0545,know if that means anything
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0546,does that mean something no that's
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0547,understandable
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0548,when you're asking for hugs and I just
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0549,don't want to be held
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0550,let me hold at that time well I do
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0551,I know hence I give you a half ass ugh
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0552,yeah my favorite thing you still get the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0553,hug I'm glad I'm glad no I'm not I want
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0554,a hug because I want a hug I want a hug
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0555,and I need the hug
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0556,what would you do if I cheated on you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0557,any other situation I would up and leave
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0558,especially since we wouldn't be living
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0559,together at that time but I have way too
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0560,much invested here I would want to know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0561,exactly why it was that drove you to
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0562,that because obviously I did something
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0563,wrong to not make you happy enough to go
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0564,look elsewhere so it's more that we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0565,would have to look at each other and try
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0566,to fix this because we have way too much
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0567,for us to just throw it away
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0568,I can't just look at you like any other
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0569,person out on the street I think that if
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0570,she cheated on me I would be like it
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0571,would it would just stimulate the
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0572,insecurities that I already have and I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0573,would just be horrified I think that my
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0574,instinct would be like the way that you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0575,are like just fuck you for this and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0576,don't break something and found cry for
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0577,like six months suck I think it would
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0578,even it would hurt more mostly because
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0579,we are like engaged and we're supposed
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0580,to have this life and please so I won't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0581,I won't do it if you don't do it well I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0582,won't do it even if you did do it but
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0583,in the back of your mind do you think
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0584,I'll leave you I mean I feel that way
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0585,when I get when I when I when I know
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0586,that I'm getting like super annoying you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0587,know like but you're obviously being
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0588,super annoying but I'm still around yeah
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0589,I feel like even if I even if I like
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0590,pushed you to your limit that you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0591,wouldn't leave me and I and that's scary
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0592,to not because I'm I I hope I'm not a
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0593,psychotic person who you know pushes you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0594,but yeah I don't I don't know I don't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0595,think so I think you would if I didn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0596,get my act together and I was just not
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0597,doing anything with my life like if I
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0598,decided to just stop going to school and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0599,then just working its and not being
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0600,motivated cuz you seem like you would
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0601,want someone to mow to push to push you
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0602,and for you to push back and if I wasn't
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0603,to do that then yeah but I have no
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0604,intentions of that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0605,what would what would make you leave me
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0606,I guess follow what would make you leave
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0607,me
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0608,you're treating more than once because
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0609,obviously if you did it once and we
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0610,tried fixing it and you did it again
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0611,then you obviously don't care and I feel
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0612,that I would be wasting my time and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0613,you'd be wasting yours
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0614,I'm still like baffled at the fact that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0615,you would even forgive me for a cheat oh
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0616,no it would take it would take a while
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0617,but that's like that's insane

Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0624,up on yourself and and
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0625,yeah and stop pushing or stop trying or
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0626,at least if you didn't have the ambition
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0627,for something big then yeah I think that
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0628,would be my straw like if it was
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0629,consistently unambitious and you just
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0630,like it would it would it would really
Man021_Woman021_Transcription_0631,dampen my ability to say with you
