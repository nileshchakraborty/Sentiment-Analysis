Man032_Woman037_0001,yeah each other to each other
Man032_Woman037_0002,hmm so what do you remember about the
Man032_Woman037_0003,first time you met so one of the first
Man032_Woman037_0004,things I remember is that I wore jean
Man032_Woman037_0005,shorts and you didn't shake my hand
Man032_Woman037_0006,uh-huh because you're afraid whether you
Man032_Woman037_0007,could shake my hand or not whether I was
Man032_Woman037_0008,show matter or not and your hair was not
Man032_Woman037_0009,as big as it was today but you had very
Man032_Woman037_0010,curly hair and I remembered that when we
Man032_Woman037_0011,were signing the form
Man032_Woman037_0012,um how we had the same we lived on the
Man032_Woman037_0013,same street
Man032_Woman037_0014,you lived on Sycamore Street and I
Man032_Woman037_0015,wasn't sick or an Avenue and I thought
Man032_Woman037_0016,that was really crazy and you had
Man032_Woman037_0017,terrible handwriting on the forum and I
Man032_Woman037_0018,did too and so I thought we had a lot in
Man032_Woman037_0019,common right away and you found out on
Man032_Woman037_0020,the first day we met you also found out
Man032_Woman037_0021,what room you were living in because you
Man032_Woman037_0022,hadn't found out before that and I
Man032_Woman037_0023,thought that was crazy
Man032_Woman037_0024,and you hadn't bought anything for your
Man032_Woman037_0025,dorm room yet and I thought you're crazy
Man032_Woman037_0026,and and that's basically it
Man032_Woman037_0027,you were pretty nice you're funny
Man032_Woman037_0028,okay what do you love about our
Man032_Woman037_0029,relationship I love that we like

Man032_Woman037_0032,your everything you like write down and
Man032_Woman037_0033,like your notes are color-coordinated
Man032_Woman037_0034,with like the subjects I think that's
Man032_Woman037_0035,ridiculous right I don't write anything
Man032_Woman037_0036,down so it helps that like knowing what
Man032_Woman037_0037,to do and scheduling good stuff

Man032_Woman037_0118,disappointed that's what I feel like a
Man032_Woman037_0119,lot of this stuff probably most of

Man032_Woman037_0150,[Music]
Man032_Woman037_0151,no I I generally tell you everything
Man032_Woman037_0152,one of my hesitant to tell them
Man032_Woman037_0153,I don't know I guess maybe I really
Man032_Woman037_0154,don't know her parents to me I think not
Man032_Woman037_0155,it would not be fun for anyone probably
Man032_Woman037_0156,give your family a bad impression of my
Man032_Woman037_0157,family and myself I know you want it and
Man032_Woman037_0158,so kind of don't mention it um what else
Man032_Woman037_0159,oh if down the line we did decide to get
Man032_Woman037_0160,married that would be possibly the worst
Man032_Woman037_0161,thing every family was ever it would be
Man032_Woman037_0162,an absolute disaster and I guess I don't
Man032_Woman037_0163,really want to tell you but all of your
Man032_Woman037_0164,plans cos like you're like really like
Man032_Woman037_0165,to plan that I don't know since when
Man032_Woman037_0166,probably since birth you've been
Man032_Woman037_0167,planning out your wedding but if it were
Man032_Woman037_0168,to happen it would definitely be nothing
Man032_Woman037_0169,like the way you planned it and you
Man032_Woman037_0170,probably would be a little disappointed
Man032_Woman037_0171,I mean that would be another
Man032_Woman037_0172,disappointment to add to the lists yes
Man032_Woman037_0173,you were also hesitant to tell me about
Man032_Woman037_0174,about Jonathan getting back to you about
Man032_Woman037_0175,about MBL right um yeah I mean I guess I
Man032_Woman037_0176,don't really like disappointing you and
Man032_Woman037_0177,like I don't want you to have like a
Man032_Woman037_0178,negative impression of my successes I
Man032_Woman037_0179,guess I don't know I got a little a
Man032_Woman037_0180,little afraid that I guess you would
Man032_Woman037_0181,judge me if when I wasn't able to go to
Man032_Woman037_0182,nvm you definitely wouldn't have I was
Man032_Woman037_0183,like irrational
Man032_Woman037_0184,yeah but I told you we did tell me not
Man032_Woman037_0185,as hesitant as you were to tell me about
Man032_Woman037_0186,your grades on the test
Man032_Woman037_0187,yes I was hesitant to tell you that
Man032_Woman037_0188,slightly more hits tune yeah

Man032_Woman037_0193,do you trust that I can provide for you
Man032_Woman037_0194,yes I do I think yeah I think I think I
Man032_Woman037_0195,mean okay so provide different things so
Man032_Woman037_0196,in so if it was if there was a future
Man032_Woman037_0197,provide probably the first thing I would
Man032_Woman037_0198,think it would be like monetarily and I
Man032_Woman037_0199,think that would be I think you'd be
Man032_Woman037_0200,able to provide I don't think that would
Man032_Woman037_0201,be a problem
Man032_Woman037_0202,you definitely provide happiness you can
Man032_Woman037_0203,definitely provide that I do trust that
Man032_Woman037_0204,you can provide that I think you could
Man032_Woman037_0205,provide like a very interesting feature
Man032_Woman037_0206,that's probably not not so boring I
Man032_Woman037_0207,think I really I don't think we would
Man032_Woman037_0208,ever get bored of each other at least
Man032_Woman037_0209,not too soon um I say I trust that you
Man032_Woman037_0210,can provide that yeah I guess those are
Man032_Woman037_0211,two things that I that I care about and
Man032_Woman037_0212,I did you provide I did you trust that
Man032_Woman037_0213,you can provide them I think it's
Man032_Woman037_0214,something I don't trust thank you for
Man032_Woman037_0215,that does it happen
Man032_Woman037_0216,[Music]

Man032_Woman037_0218,I'll be relating you're off the hook for
Man032_Woman037_0219,now
Man032_Woman037_0220,what do I do that makes you think that
Man032_Woman037_0221,we shouldn't be together
Man032_Woman037_0222,this is also amazing a joke
Man032_Woman037_0223,you're very prone to outbreaks of
Man032_Woman037_0224,extreme anxiety and nervousness I mean
Man032_Woman037_0225,like they're not like like a huge
Man032_Woman037_0226,dealing that they go doesn't make me
Man032_Woman037_0227,question but like I guess I don't know
Man032_Woman037_0228,you get like anxious and then everything
Man032_Woman037_0229,becomes about you kind of and like it
Man032_Woman037_0230,turns into like a bad time for both of
Man032_Woman037_0231,us it doesn't really have to be and I
Man032_Woman037_0232,don't really like that very much like II
Man032_Woman037_0233,sometimes you yell like you're like I
Man032_Woman037_0234,don't know get angry at me for no reason
Man032_Woman037_0235,they're like spilling know kind of no

Man032_Woman037_0240,the big thing I guess I would like if
Man032_Woman037_0241,you were able to get be more in control
Man032_Woman037_0242,of that I guess your anxiety is
Man032_Woman037_0243,sometimes you say hurtful things
Man032_Woman037_0244,and I don't like that so anything else
Man032_Woman037_0245,[Music]
Man032_Woman037_0246,you have a tendency to fall asleep a lot

Man032_Woman037_0322,actually does come out like that's
Man032_Woman037_0323,really sad is anything else
Man032_Woman037_0324,I think I don't know maybe I don't know
Man032_Woman037_0325,it's just it's just different I'm trying
Man032_Woman037_0326,to describe it I don't want to say
Man032_Woman037_0327,you're like I think you try to be who
Man032_Woman037_0328,you used to be like because you
Man032_Woman037_0329,definitely different now I mean people
Man032_Woman037_0330,like just change like as they get older
Man032_Woman037_0331,but you're just like a lot a lot
Man032_Woman037_0332,different a like based on your like
Man032_Woman037_0333,experiences but also like with me and
Man032_Woman037_0334,like with your friends and like
Man032_Woman037_0335,definitely different from how you would
Man032_Woman037_0336,have been if you were like if you went
Man032_Woman037_0337,to like Queens College or something like
Man032_Woman037_0338,that like or stayed with different
Man032_Woman037_0339,friends or like we're still like really
Man032_Woman037_0340,Jewish so like you use like I feel like
Man032_Woman037_0341,you try to like still be that person
Man032_Woman037_0342,that you used to be and you try to act
Man032_Woman037_0343,like that maybe and so it's like it's
Man032_Woman037_0344,not like you like when you then you look
Man032_Woman037_0345,at me and then you're like oh yeah like
Man032_Woman037_0346,it's Jason this is Jason but sometimes I
Man032_Woman037_0347,feel like you try to be like what what
Man032_Woman037_0348,they want or like who you who you would
Man032_Woman037_0349,still be if that was still like your
Man032_Woman037_0350,bubble
Man032_Woman037_0351,how do you feel about the pressure from
Man032_Woman037_0352,my family um I feel pretty good about it
Man032_Woman037_0353,I don't really get that much pressure
Man032_Woman037_0354,there's a little bit like I'm sure they
Man032_Woman037_0355,wish that I was Catholic
Man032_Woman037_0356,what do they want they probably want
Man032_Woman037_0357,baptized children that don't I don't I
Man032_Woman037_0358,mean II like they like me and they don't
Man032_Woman037_0359,really there's not that much pressure I
Man032_Woman037_0360,know your um what is it your your
Man032_Woman037_0361,uncle's father-in-law be on it he's
Man032_Woman037_0362,pressuring me with it he's just
Man032_Woman037_0363,measuring it's like I don't know what
Man032_Woman037_0364,wasn't he just like wants me to marry
Man032_Woman037_0365,you like immediately something I don't
Man032_Woman037_0366,know what he wants he's really sick and
Man032_Woman037_0367,so he's like I don't know if I like you
Man032_Woman037_0368,you got really sick and so I yeah he's
Man032_Woman037_0369,probably just like I want I like them
Man032_Woman037_0370,both so like I want them both to get
Man032_Woman037_0371,married before but while I can still be
Man032_Woman037_0372,there that's probably why he's
Man032_Woman037_0373,pressuring you
Man032_Woman037_0374,yeah that's funny like that's not that's
Man032_Woman037_0375,I guess it's positive pressure you know
Man032_Woman037_0376,if it's unwanted that's good they're
Man032_Woman037_0377,really there really isn't a lot of
Man032_Woman037_0378,pressure to be honest that I feel
Man032_Woman037_0379,sometimes I feel like like um your mom
Man032_Woman037_0380,wants me to give you like more gifts or
Man032_Woman037_0381,do take you out more I guess but that's
Man032_Woman037_0382,very minimal and I feel like that's just
Man032_Woman037_0383,every every girlfriend's mom just once
Man032_Woman037_0384,more for the dog
Man032_Woman037_0385,overall I feel pretty good pretty good
Man032_Woman037_0386,about the pusher
Man032_Woman037_0387,how about pressure from my my dad or
Man032_Woman037_0388,brother do you feel any pressure from
Man032_Woman037_0389,now I feel no pressure from your dad
Man032_Woman037_0390,he's pretty chill I don't feel any
Man032_Woman037_0391,pressure from your brother I mean I kind
Man032_Woman037_0392,of want to like get along with him
Man032_Woman037_0393,better but he's in Indiana so not gonna
Man032_Woman037_0394,happen earlier I mean these Jill and I
Man032_Woman037_0395,think I think he likes me I like him so
Man032_Woman037_0396,you feel the most pressure for my mom
Man032_Woman037_0397,yes definitely I mean you probably you
Man032_Woman037_0398,probably do that about grandparents no
Man032_Woman037_0399,do grandparents like your grandma
Man032_Woman037_0400,specifically it was probably the only
Man032_Woman037_0401,one who would pressure me but I don't
Man032_Woman037_0402,feel like there is anything it's pretty
Man032_Woman037_0403,good actually
Man032_Woman037_0404,you're from your side okay this is a
Man032_Woman037_0405,good one it's a really good one kissing
Man032_Woman037_0406,okay how will we raise our kids that's a
Man032_Woman037_0407,very good question so so lots of
Man032_Woman037_0408,religious difficulty there so the way
Man032_Woman037_0409,that I I mean the I mean there's there's
Man032_Woman037_0410,many different ways to think about this
Man032_Woman037_0411,I don't know like I feel like I don't
Man032_Woman037_0412,know like my whole life when I thought
Man032_Woman037_0413,about having kids I'll just assume that
Man032_Woman037_0414,they would do like the same things that
Man032_Woman037_0415,I would do like I still want to live in
Man032_Woman037_0416,like Suffolk grow up and like um like a
Man032_Woman037_0417,suburban area sometimes like public
Man032_Woman037_0418,school like not worry about like private
Man032_Woman037_0419,fancy schools or anything like the
Man032_Woman037_0420,religious part for me is like not
Man032_Woman037_0421,important but I just assumed that would
Man032_Woman037_0422,happen because that's just like what
Man032_Woman037_0423,what I did also I assumed that I would
Man032_Woman037_0424,like celebrate Christmas and Easter and
Man032_Woman037_0425,just like holidays that I've always
Man032_Woman037_0426,celebrated
Man032_Woman037_0427,[Music]
Man032_Woman037_0428,like hung out and done things on
Man032_Woman037_0429,Saturdays um not had to worry about
Man032_Woman037_0430,other other end of things or also like
Man032_Woman037_0431,grazing with like probably like doesn't
Man032_Woman037_0432,seem amount of family time that I had
Man032_Woman037_0433,like my family is not like the closest
Man032_Woman037_0434,family in the world we're not like like
Man032_Woman037_0435,a crazy Italian family or anything like
Man032_Woman037_0436,that but like like we we spend a good
Man032_Woman037_0437,amount of time with my family like we
Man032_Woman037_0438,live all pretty close like to my uncles
Man032_Woman037_0439,and stuff like that so I see like my
Man032_Woman037_0440,cousins often whereas like like you
Man032_Woman037_0441,don't really see like your family so
Man032_Woman037_0442,much pretty separated so I kind of I
Man032_Woman037_0443,mean when I think about raising kids I
Man032_Woman037_0444,just think the kind of the same kind of
Man032_Woman037_0445,upbringing I had so saying all of that
Man032_Woman037_0446,since a lot of that probably the biggest
Man032_Woman037_0447,problems would be like with with
Man032_Woman037_0448,religious things like how they would be
Man032_Woman037_0449,raised religiously or with religion if
Man032_Woman037_0450,at all so like being being baptized or
Man032_Woman037_0451,getting a communion or a confirmation or
Man032_Woman037_0452,even celebrating Christmas at all would
Man032_Woman037_0453,be like really terrible with your family
Man032_Woman037_0454,because they would not want their sons
Man032_Woman037_0455,children to be baptized or celebrate
Man032_Woman037_0456,Christmas probably often um
Man032_Woman037_0457,and I don't know that it's not even like
Man032_Woman037_0458,the religious part is important to me
Man032_Woman037_0459,it's not like oh I need to get my child
Man032_Woman037_0460,baptized for religious reasons which
Man032_Woman037_0461,like you know that but like it would
Man032_Woman037_0462,just feel like something that like my
Man032_Woman037_0463,family would just want to celebrate like
Man032_Woman037_0464,we just want to like put our my baby and
Man032_Woman037_0465,like a white like gown and then like
Man032_Woman037_0466,pour water and said and like have a
Man032_Woman037_0467,party after it's like that's what I care
Man032_Woman037_0468,about that's my family cares about so
Man032_Woman037_0469,like that's not like it's not the
Man032_Woman037_0470,religious part it's just that like if we
Man032_Woman037_0471,didn't do it it would be like oh like
Man032_Woman037_0472,it's just not the it's not the same like
Man032_Woman037_0473,why didn't we do that like then it's
Man032_Woman037_0474,like oh that's weird so it's not a
Man032_Woman037_0475,religious thing we're just like you bet
Man032_Woman037_0476,worse like you what's about religion you
Man032_Woman037_0477,really oh okay
Man032_Woman037_0478,like understood but it's not even which
Man032_Woman037_0479,like annoys you even more
Man032_Woman037_0480,[Laughter]
Man032_Woman037_0481,so and and like yeah what's the old so
Man032_Woman037_0482,those are differences things that I
Man032_Woman037_0483,think that if we were to raise kids that
Man032_Woman037_0484,would be pretty pretty on the same level
Man032_Woman037_0485,which would be like we both want to
Man032_Woman037_0486,raise them in a way that would be like
Man032_Woman037_0487,really really comfortable for them we
Man032_Woman037_0488,wouldn't want to really force them to do
Man032_Woman037_0489,do things like especially the gorillas
Man032_Woman037_0490,just things or like other things like if
Man032_Woman037_0491,they would didn't want to do I think you
Man032_Woman037_0492,would probably agree with that and then
Man032_Woman037_0493,like we did both want to like raise like
Man032_Woman037_0494,smart kids like we don't have our kids
Man032_Woman037_0495,like we would probably like both do you
Man032_Woman037_0496,like like fun like learning things like
Man032_Woman037_0497,you probably you want to go to the zoo a
Man032_Woman037_0498,lot I feel like that'd be fine like we'd
Man032_Woman037_0499,probably go on like a lot of outings I'd
Man032_Woman037_0500,be like educational most I feel like
Man032_Woman037_0501,most kids probably outings are I don't
Man032_Woman037_0502,know like a lot I would want to do like
Man032_Woman037_0503,a lot of outside things and you'd want
Man032_Woman037_0504,to do like a lot of like educational
Man032_Woman037_0505,things so we would like have fun with
Man032_Woman037_0506,that I think I think I don't know would
Man032_Woman037_0507,you where do you would you want to raise
Man032_Woman037_0508,kids in like a suburban area or would
Man032_Woman037_0509,you want to try to do more urban um I
Man032_Woman037_0510,don't know I think either way is fine
Man032_Woman037_0511,I'm kind of I really like the city so
Man032_Woman037_0512,maybe I would entertain the idea of
Man032_Woman037_0513,remaining in the city
Man032_Woman037_0514,are you living in like Brooklyn or
Man032_Woman037_0515,Queens like I don't know what was the
Man032_Woman037_0516,like the the first house you grew up in
Man032_Woman037_0517,besides like the whole religious aspect
Man032_Woman037_0518,of it like how did you like that area it
Man032_Woman037_0519,was all right I took the bus and train
Man032_Woman037_0520,to school like really young yeah it's I
Man032_Woman037_0521,mean it's kind of convenient you don't
Man032_Woman037_0522,need a car or anything
Man032_Woman037_0523,I feel like guys mm-hmm yes that's kind
Man032_Woman037_0524,of how I feel I don't know I I'd
Man032_Woman037_0525,probably nervous like I don't want to be
Man032_Woman037_0526,bring like a stroller into the subway
Man032_Woman037_0527,like I'm not I like I feel so bad for
Man032_Woman037_0528,those people those women who do that I'm
Man032_Woman037_0529,like how do you do that cuz that's like
Man032_Woman037_0530,impossible I would not want to do that
Man032_Woman037_0531,at all so in that aspect
Man032_Woman037_0532,I would not want to like raise like
Man032_Woman037_0533,children like in a more urban area
Man032_Woman037_0534,broward like have to be using
Man032_Woman037_0535,transportation like that like where I
Man032_Woman037_0536,would not be able to have a car or I
Man032_Woman037_0537,could just like put a seat where would I
Man032_Woman037_0538,called see car seats yeah a car seat in
Man032_Woman037_0539,the car and like be able to do that like
Man032_Woman037_0540,really fast that would annoy me a lot
Man032_Woman037_0541,I'm like no I'd be afraid like even in
Man032_Woman037_0542,suburban areas you have to worry about
Man032_Woman037_0543,like like like things like in the
Man032_Woman037_0544,average like toxins or whatever but like
Man032_Woman037_0545,in the city it's a little bit more
Man032_Woman037_0546,worrisome like you never know what's
Man032_Woman037_0547,going on like in your like apartment or
Man032_Woman037_0548,outside like nearby is there like like
Man032_Woman037_0549,some kind of area or like like a where
Man032_Woman037_0550,do they call like places where garbage
Man032_Woman037_0551,are like you don't want to live like
Man032_Woman037_0552,next to that or like like I don't know
Man032_Woman037_0553,like like I don't ever want to raise
Man032_Woman037_0554,kids in that kind of an area not that
Man032_Woman037_0555,like where I live is so much better so
Man032_Woman037_0556,far away from all of that but I don't
Man032_Woman037_0557,know I find what do you have kids
Man032_Woman037_0558,probably worried about like all those
Man032_Woman037_0559,little things like oh my god what are
Man032_Woman037_0560,they breathing oh my god what kind of
Man032_Woman037_0561,milk are they drinking like that's what
Man032_Woman037_0562,I would like worried about probably
Man032_Woman037_0563,worried about that yeah so see that you
Man032_Woman037_0564,would worry about that but I would yeah
Man032_Woman037_0565,but um you know what else what are they
Man032_Woman037_0566,what things do you think that I worry
Man032_Woman037_0567,about that you would totally not worry
Man032_Woman037_0568,about coolly like what they lived in the
Man032_Woman037_0569,city no legal is it no specialized
Man032_Woman037_0570,specialized in high schools hate that
Man032_Woman037_0571,but I would disagree entirely public
Man032_Woman037_0572,schools the way to go okay okay yeah I
Man032_Woman037_0573,think religion we probably the biggest
Man032_Woman037_0574,obstacle the biggest controversy yeah I
Man032_Woman037_0575,would totally like I don't know I would
Man032_Woman037_0576,do everything I would just like
Man032_Woman037_0577,celebrate everything cuz like it's not
Man032_Woman037_0578,the actual religious meaning that like
Man032_Woman037_0579,has has meaning to me but it's like the
Man032_Woman037_0580,celebration of it like I want to have a
Man032_Woman037_0581,Christmas tree and I want to have a
Man032_Woman037_0582,menorah too and like let's celebrate
Man032_Woman037_0583,Kwanzaa and
Man032_Woman037_0584,and that uh forget I forget the Hindu
Man032_Woman037_0585,name for the festival of lights holiday
Man032_Woman037_0586,but that one too I want to celebrate
Man032_Woman037_0587,that T like let's just celebrate
Man032_Woman037_0588,everything so it's really fun if I like
Man032_Woman037_0589,that'd be weird
Man032_Woman037_0590,what do you think is the next step in
Man032_Woman037_0591,our relationship definitely moving in
Man032_Woman037_0592,together after after I graduate you saw
Man032_Woman037_0593,the fifth year but after I graduate I'm
Man032_Woman037_0594,gonna move ahead in the dorms obviously
Man032_Woman037_0595,and you're gonna follow me
Man032_Woman037_0596,no no cuz like I mean we had plans with
Man032_Woman037_0597,um Brian and shoo-shoo it's you know to
Man032_Woman037_0598,like get an apartment of Brooklyn
Man032_Woman037_0599,together and I think I think really like
Man032_Woman037_0600,until until I graduate our relationships
Man032_Woman037_0601,kind of like Anastasis where it's not
Man032_Woman037_0602,really gonna change much so that's
Man032_Woman037_0603,definitely moving in getting your
Man032_Woman037_0604,parents who weren't even allowed to live
Man032_Woman037_0605,together when they were engaged to my
Man032_Woman037_0606,parents you don't believe in sex before
Man032_Woman037_0607,marriage - uh yeah maybe look the other
Man032_Woman037_0608,way I just be like like whatever like
Man032_Woman037_0609,you can't we can't control her you guys
Man032_Woman037_0610,I think that'll be the next step
Man032_Woman037_0611,difficult step yeah I mean it'll be
Man032_Woman037_0612,difficult but I mean it's gonna not
Man032_Woman037_0613,difficult for us I don't think it'd be
Man032_Woman037_0614,too difficult for us no I mean it was
Man032_Woman037_0615,hard probably in some degree for
Man032_Woman037_0616,everyone but I don't think the degree
Man032_Woman037_0617,would be as steep yeah but definitely
Man032_Woman037_0618,moving in I think you agree yeah it's
Man032_Woman037_0619,one of the closest thing to also like oh
Man032_Woman037_0620,yeah I totally agree what you said about
Man032_Woman037_0621,like being in like a total like kind of
Man032_Woman037_0622,stasis because we're kind of just living
Man032_Woman037_0623,like like in the same thing for like
Man032_Woman037_0624,four years so yeah and after next year
Man032_Woman037_0625,it's gonna be interesting to see how
Man032_Woman037_0626,that works out or if it works out or
Man032_Woman037_0627,then what happens after that yeah yeah
Man032_Woman037_0628,more lies and more magic for your family
Man032_Woman037_0629,I think I know the answer to discussions
Man032_Woman037_0630,right in the back of your mind are you
Man032_Woman037_0631,scared that I'll walk away okay short
Man032_Woman037_0632,answer yes
Man032_Woman037_0633,[Laughter]
Man032_Woman037_0634,so I mean I think I think unconsciously
Man032_Woman037_0635,there's always something I mean whether
Man032_Woman037_0636,you're like a really confident person or
Man032_Woman037_0637,not it's probably always that just cuz
Man032_Woman037_0638,you never know I mean do I think about
Man032_Woman037_0639,it every day it's something I think
Man032_Woman037_0640,about no but like if I was gonna stay in
Man032_Woman037_0641,the back of my mind like if I was gonna
Man032_Woman037_0642,try to extrapolate what would happen to
Man032_Woman037_0643,our relationship in the future I don't
Man032_Woman037_0644,know someone someone put this someone
Man032_Woman037_0645,put this idea in my mind one it's like
Man032_Woman037_0646,oh you're gonna be a doctor and then
Man032_Woman037_0647,you're gonna be around like all these
Man032_Woman037_0648,successful like other like smart or like
Man032_Woman037_0649,like hot nurses all the time and you're
Man032_Woman037_0650,just like not not gonna be like faithful
Man032_Woman037_0651,or something I know that's like kind of
Man032_Woman037_0652,I mean that's gonna you'll walk away
Man032_Woman037_0653,necessarily but like but like like yeah
Man032_Woman037_0654,I guess like being unfaithful in that
Man032_Woman037_0655,respect um because I mean yeah I like
Man032_Woman037_0656,that's true like I don't know I think
Man032_Woman037_0657,you doctors like a pretty cool thing to
Man032_Woman037_0658,do and like a lot of people really like
Man032_Woman037_0659,doctors and if they if they thought they
Man032_Woman037_0660,had a chance I like like being worth one
Man032_Woman037_0661,they would probably try to I mean yeah I
Man032_Woman037_0662,think I think you're a great person
Man032_Woman037_0663,and I think you're a catch so who else
Man032_Woman037_0664,wouldn't think so like everyone everyone
Man032_Woman037_0665,wrote on you I would think so like I
Man032_Woman037_0666,guess I guess that can make you kind of
Man032_Woman037_0667,think we're make me think like oh in the
Man032_Woman037_0668,future like would that be a problem
Man032_Woman037_0669,the also the like the big thing that I
Man032_Woman037_0670,would actually that I actually like to
Man032_Woman037_0671,think about like every once in a while
Man032_Woman037_0672,would be like if something like if there
Man032_Woman037_0673,was something wrong like with like if we
Man032_Woman037_0674,had kids like if like there was some
Man032_Woman037_0675,kind of disability or anything that was
Man032_Woman037_0676,like really rough or like
Man032_Woman037_0677,hard I'd be afraid that you would just
Man032_Woman037_0678,bolt because because you don't want that
Man032_Woman037_0679,like nobody nobody wants that but if
Man032_Woman037_0680,that was like your your reality like no
Man032_Woman037_0681,no I'm not saying it's easier for like
Man032_Woman037_0682,men to leave rather than like women to
Man032_Woman037_0683,leave like but if I if I would still be
Man032_Woman037_0684,afraid of it I would still like to think
Man032_Woman037_0685,about it yeah cuz you mentioned that
Man032_Woman037_0686,once to me and I was like okay so so
Man032_Woman037_0687,yeah I mean there's a long time ago that
Man032_Woman037_0688,you mentioned it like probably not
Man032_Woman037_0689,relationship was still be very very
Man032_Woman037_0690,young I'm probably just discussing
Man032_Woman037_0691,something and you said it and I was like
Man032_Woman037_0692,but it stayed with me it was like
Man032_Woman037_0693,important to me and you probably didn't
Man032_Woman037_0694,mean it to you probably didn't want it
Man032_Woman037_0695,to but it did stay with me and I do I do
Man032_Woman037_0696,still think about it because because I
Man032_Woman037_0697,know I know people who like that's
Man032_Woman037_0698,happened to and it's really rough cuz
Man032_Woman037_0699,like it's what you need you need support
Man032_Woman037_0700,and like that'd be terrible
Man032_Woman037_0701,mm-hm you're being able thing I thought
Man032_Woman037_0702,you'd say what you're like your mom or
Man032_Woman037_0703,grandmother like the story of like this
Man032_Woman037_0704,person who was like had a better Jewish
Man032_Woman037_0705,boyfriend in college like after they
Man032_Woman037_0706,graduated or something like you broke
Man032_Woman037_0707,over there was that yeah so what
Man032_Woman037_0708,happened yeah I don't even know it was
Man032_Woman037_0709,it was promised you would but yeah so it
Man032_Woman037_0710,was it was actually the Martin miss
Man032_Woman037_0711,Martinez the LuAnn I talked I told you
Man032_Woman037_0712,about that I worked for her she told me
Man032_Woman037_0713,the story how like her daughter was
Man032_Woman037_0714,dating was dating like this Jewish guy
Man032_Woman037_0715,in college and they had like a great
Man032_Woman037_0716,relationship and like whatever and they
Man032_Woman037_0717,were they were like getting an apartment
Man032_Woman037_0718,together moving in together and like
Man032_Woman037_0719,they bought the apartment they're like
Man032_Woman037_0720,moving in like moving in at the time and
Man032_Woman037_0721,he was like oh no sorry it's been great
Man032_Woman037_0722,but I gotta go be Jewish again buy or
Man032_Woman037_0723,not even but he just like left and
Man032_Woman037_0724,totally was like no yeah and and someone
Man032_Woman037_0725,else I got I heard I hear lots of
Man032_Woman037_0726,stories for my mom I guess but also
Man032_Woman037_0727,someone else's like daughter got still
Man032_Woman037_0728,like they were engaged and or they were
Man032_Woman037_0729,living together and they were engaged
Man032_Woman037_0730,like they just got engaged and it's like
Man032_Woman037_0731,they were they really wouldn't either
Man032_Woman037_0732,before they were engaged
Man032_Woman037_0733,and then like you just bounced and that
Man032_Woman037_0734,was like my mom's my mom's theory freely
Man032_Woman037_0735,you're not living together before you're
Man032_Woman037_0736,married like oh well Kiki leaves like
Man032_Woman037_0737,thinks that one story mom but um but yes
Man032_Woman037_0738,I mean do I do I worry about that so
Man032_Woman037_0739,much
Man032_Woman037_0740,not really probably probably not as much
Man032_Woman037_0741,as like the other two honestly I don't
Man032_Woman037_0742,really think about those as much how is
Man032_Woman037_0743,money a conflict in our relationship
Man032_Woman037_0744,[Music]
Man032_Woman037_0745,okay so you expect me to pay for most
Man032_Woman037_0746,things but I don't really have an income
Man032_Woman037_0747,and so I kind of feel bad and I guess I
Man032_Woman037_0748,wish that I mean I would like to pay for
Man032_Woman037_0749,everything you know but it's just it's
Man032_Woman037_0750,like my parents money really just uh I
Man032_Woman037_0751,mean you know that and you you do
Man032_Woman037_0752,understand you you understand that I
Man032_Woman037_0753,mean you let me like pick up the bills
Man032_Woman037_0754,sometimes but it is a little it puts a
Man032_Woman037_0755,bit of a strain I guess on me having to
Man032_Woman037_0756,pay for everything cuz I feel that like
Man032_Woman037_0757,I kind of disagree with the whole
Man032_Woman037_0758,mention paper women thing just in
Man032_Woman037_0759,general even if I wasn't even if I did
Man032_Woman037_0760,have a lot of like money lying around I
Man032_Woman037_0761,wouldn't know I wouldn't want to I mean
Man032_Woman037_0762,it's not it's not a selfish thing is
Man032_Woman037_0763,just an equality on the same on the same
Man032_Woman037_0764,level kind of thing but you're very
Man032_Woman037_0765,old-fashioned in that respect at least
Man032_Woman037_0766,and see you see you expect me to pay for
Man032_Woman037_0767,stuff but it's not really a conflict I
Man032_Woman037_0768,mean you make more money than I do so I
Man032_Woman037_0769,wish that you would do things sometimes
Man032_Woman037_0770,but it's not really a problem it's not
Man032_Woman037_0771,that much of a conference I'm happy to
Man032_Woman037_0772,pay for stuff it makes you happy yeah I
Man032_Woman037_0773,would say it's I would agree it's like
Man032_Woman037_0774,very and frequently that we would ever
Man032_Woman037_0775,have a conflict over like that but yeah
Man032_Woman037_0776,that's now that it's on film it you can
Man032_Woman037_0777,okay
Man032_Woman037_0778,I'm glad you brought it back up okay I
Man032_Woman037_0779,know the answer to that one
Man032_Woman037_0780,are you okay with me sleeping with other
Man032_Woman037_0781,people the answer would be no I would
Man032_Woman037_0782,not feel comfortable with you sleeping
Man032_Woman037_0783,with other people um just no I wouldn't
Man032_Woman037_0784,I don't I don't think you would I don't
Man032_Woman037_0785,think yeah I don't think you would be
Man032_Woman037_0786,comfortable with it either honestly um
Man032_Woman037_0787,and I would hope so too
Man032_Woman037_0788,um because that's what I would want but
Man032_Woman037_0789,I don't think you would um but I
Man032_Woman037_0790,wouldn't be okay with it especially like
Man032_Woman037_0791,if you if you didn't tell me if you told
Man032_Woman037_0792,me I'd be very angry now trying to talk
Man032_Woman037_0793,to you about it and try to persuade you
Man032_Woman037_0794,to do otherwise but especially if you
Man032_Woman037_0795,didn't tell me oh because it's it's
Man032_Woman037_0796,something that I would be okay with and
Man032_Woman037_0797,I know that it's something that you
Man032_Woman037_0798,would know that I wouldn't be okay with
Man032_Woman037_0799,so I think that would that be a problem
Man032_Woman037_0800,also because you you you would know that
Man032_Woman037_0801,you're doing something that would like
Man032_Woman037_0802,really hurt me so bad that happened that
Man032_Woman037_0803,would be like a bigger issue but even if
Man032_Woman037_0804,you came in acts to me I would still be
Man032_Woman037_0805,like no even it was like a friend or
Man032_Woman037_0806,even if it was a stranger like either
Man032_Woman037_0807,way I wouldn't be comfortable with it
Man032_Woman037_0808,that's something that I want to share
Man032_Woman037_0809,with you and I don't really want to
Man032_Woman037_0810,share with anyone else I don't agree
Man032_Woman037_0811,which one of my friends have you slept

Man032_Woman037_0817,pretty sure you have not but if you
Man032_Woman037_0818,could I'm saying yes yes you can't sleep
Man032_Woman037_0819,with one of my friends who oh no doesn't

Man032_Woman037_0828,Brian Brian
Man032_Woman037_0829,Davey Brian I would definitely think
Man032_Woman037_0830,with Brian maybe Brian it would be no no
Man032_Woman037_0831,what does it you may be right um I
Man032_Woman037_0832,really think with anyone to be honest
Man032_Woman037_0833,even if I didn't have permission
Man032_Woman037_0834,No all right do you really come when we
Man032_Woman037_0835,have sex I don't fake it no I don't I
Man032_Woman037_0836,want to say I never have might have
Man032_Woman037_0837,exaggerated but never faked it might
Man032_Woman037_0838,have wanted to fake it sometimes but
Man032_Woman037_0839,never did exaggerations not unlike that
Man032_Woman037_0840,doesn't really happen probably probably
Man032_Woman037_0841,more in the beginning of my relationship
Man032_Woman037_0842,like we start sleeping together I wanted
Man032_Woman037_0843,to like exaggerate yeah all right like
Man032_Woman037_0844,yeah you know what I mean but um but but
Man032_Woman037_0845,yes yes
Man032_Woman037_0846,who is more power in the relationship
Man032_Woman037_0847,you or me probably you just cuz um I
Man032_Woman037_0848,don't really care that much either way
Man032_Woman037_0849,about a lot of things and you have some
Man032_Woman037_0850,strong opinions about things
Man032_Woman037_0851,let it go along with it whatever just
Man032_Woman037_0852,like to avoid stressful like
Man032_Woman037_0853,interactions I guess but also just
Man032_Woman037_0854,because I don't really care
Man032_Woman037_0855,let's see um let's see an example like
Man032_Woman037_0856,if you want to go somewhere and I want
Man032_Woman037_0857,to go somewhere else
Man032_Woman037_0858,yeah that's not an example would you'd
Man032_Woman037_0859,probably end up going where you want to
Man032_Woman037_0860,go
Man032_Woman037_0861,okay listen listening listening uh if I
Man032_Woman037_0862,want to come and be interviewed together
Man032_Woman037_0863,and you you didn't really care either
Man032_Woman037_0864,way and I said we're doing it you would
Man032_Woman037_0865,say okay yeah but I don't think that's
Man032_Woman037_0866,like I guess maybe that's like really
Man032_Woman037_0867,it's a power summary guys I said we're
Man032_Woman037_0868,doing this and you said okay yeah I
Man032_Woman037_0869,guess you could say that also like if
Man032_Woman037_0870,you want me to take us out or like get
Man032_Woman037_0871,ice cream roburt eating and I I want
Man032_Woman037_0872,pasta and stuff and you're like no only
Man032_Woman037_0873,one cup per person one cup of coffee
Man032_Woman037_0874,person said I didn't work out anyway
Man032_Woman037_0875,yeah okay fine you have more power than
Man032_Woman037_0876,relationship there's only cuz they
Man032_Woman037_0877,believe you have it okay I like
Man032_Woman037_0878,understated power I also let you think
Man032_Woman037_0879,you have understated power that's how
Man032_Woman037_0880,much power I have if you could change
Man032_Woman037_0881,one thing in our relationship what would
Man032_Woman037_0882,it be and why
Man032_Woman037_0883,if I could change one thing a
Man032_Woman037_0884,relationship it would probably be like
Man032_Woman037_0885,the stress of religion because that's
Man032_Woman037_0886,really hard on both of us even if it's
Man032_Woman037_0887,like it's not an everyday thing
Man032_Woman037_0888,especially not anymore but especially
Man032_Woman037_0889,like looking into the future that's like
Man032_Woman037_0890,something that's gonna be really hard in
Man032_Woman037_0891,a relationship and so if I could change
Man032_Woman037_0892,that it would be that that wouldn't be
Man032_Woman037_0893,an issue whether I don't know what that
Man032_Woman037_0894,means how I would just like a race that
Man032_Woman037_0895,but if I could change change those
Man032_Woman037_0896,stresses I would on our future because I
Man032_Woman037_0897,don't wanna I don't wanna worry about
Man032_Woman037_0898,our future together especially not like
Man032_Woman037_0899,in regards to that so I would change
Man032_Woman037_0900,that if I could I wish that I like I
Man032_Woman037_0901,feel like I'm always the one putting
Man032_Woman037_0902,stress on you you don't really put so
Man032_Woman037_0903,much stress on me if there's any stress
Man032_Woman037_0904,given it's usually from me to you yeah
Man032_Woman037_0905,no no I just feel bad I also don't want
Man032_Woman037_0906,to be the bad guy but I also just don't
Man032_Woman037_0907,want to do that cuz like if it was
Man032_Woman037_0908,opposite like I wouldn't want
Man032_Woman037_0909,I wouldn't want like being stressed out
Man032_Woman037_0910,and relationship because of my partner
Man032_Woman037_0911,because of you I wouldn't want that and
Man032_Woman037_0912,I don't want to do it to you
Man032_Woman037_0913,I also wish that when I did like stress
Man032_Woman037_0914,out that you would yeah you would be
Man032_Woman037_0915,more understanding I know that you are
Man032_Woman037_0916,understanding but I wish you to be more
Man032_Woman037_0917,understanding and like help me out I
Man032_Woman037_0918,feel like you you feel like sometimes
Man032_Woman037_0919,like if you did do that you'd be like a
Man032_Woman037_0920,pushover and like or I don't know like
Man032_Woman037_0921,pushover but I don't know that I would
Man032_Woman037_0922,just be like taking advantage of you in
Man032_Woman037_0923,some way by like don't give me that face
Man032_Woman037_0924,okay okay so I wish that I didn't I wish
Man032_Woman037_0925,I didn't put stress on you and I wish I
Man032_Woman037_0926,didn't stress out and put stress on you
Man032_Woman037_0927,from my stressing out but I also wish
Man032_Woman037_0928,that when I did stress out that they you
Man032_Woman037_0929,be more understanding of it and try to
Man032_Woman037_0930,help me more than you even do could you
Man032_Woman037_0931,do but I wish would be even more nursing
Man032_Woman037_0932,which is hard to ask
Man032_Woman037_0933,cuz you're already understanding but
Man032_Woman037_0934,it's one more I feel like I feel like
Man032_Woman037_0935,we're both very supportive of each other
Man032_Woman037_0936,but I feel like when when things are
Man032_Woman037_0937,rough I'm a little more like in with
Man032_Woman037_0938,your stuff I'm always that I don't know
Man032_Woman037_0939,although one more selfless may be like
Man032_Woman037_0940,when I stressed out a lot and like put
Man032_Woman037_0941,all that anxiety and like stress on you
Man032_Woman037_0942,and I come to you because you're the one
Man032_Woman037_0943,I want to come to you and like tell me
Man032_Woman037_0944,with that stress I would hear more a
Man032_Woman037_0945,little less a little more selfless about
Man032_Woman037_0946,it because I feel like a lot of times
Man032_Woman037_0947,you're you're thinking about how
Man032_Woman037_0948,stressed out it's making you when
Man032_Woman037_0949,whenever I'm coming to you because I'm
Man032_Woman037_0950,having a problem and you're just think
Man032_Woman037_0951,about how much I'm stressing you out so
Man032_Woman037_0952,if I could change that I would because I
Man032_Woman037_0953,don't want to show see you up I wish you
Man032_Woman037_0954,would help me out more and not be
Man032_Woman037_0955,stressed out it's a long explanation but
Man032_Woman037_0956,[Music]
Man032_Woman037_0957,I could change one thing about our
Man032_Woman037_0958,relationship I wish three things I guess
Man032_Woman037_0959,I can't come the list I wish that I

Man032_Woman037_0998,have a little more control over your
Man032_Woman037_0999,anxiety because I think married life
Man032_Woman037_1000,especially with children is gonna be

Man032_Woman037_1005,hard not all the time obviously and like
Man032_Woman037_1006,it's not a deal breaker but I would like
Man032_Woman037_1007,for that a little bit of internal change
Man032_Woman037_1008,but otherwise did you really great
