Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0008,passionate you are like that's like the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0009,first thing that I was like so attracted
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0010,to so I just love your passion just for
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0011,life and for your relationship with God
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0012,and all those things and because God
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0013,told me to I don't use your choice think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0014,about this well I mean that's like the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0015,main reasons because you're a good man
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0016,so I asked for my pals yes that looks
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0017,like you were writing I know that's so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0018,weird
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0019,who are these yeah yeah a little less
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0020,legible
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0021,how about legit looks exactly like your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0022,writing that's very bad not bad look
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0023,it's never a fault
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0024,like we read it what I'm not I grew up
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0025,in a generation we not to write anything
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0026,I wish they taught us calligraphy is a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0027,perfect okay so when was the moment you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0028,knew you loved me well this is
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0029,interesting
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0030,because I think if I were now looking
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0031,back because I can say it would be now a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0032,lot more but I think I knew I loved you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0033,when we started hanging out like my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0034,first friends but I just had a cannon so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0035,much like other shit and overlapping
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0036,things in my life look like total
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0037,insecurities and things were obvious I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0038,not ignoring it and then eventually
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0039,sabotage it so I knew I mean if I was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0040,just like not at that I'm just gonna be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0041,like you're my buddy this is a great no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0042,problem you know and then the moment we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0043,started like dating and getting close I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0044,was just like trying to like put it in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0045,like a little compartment because I was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0046,like I knew it was like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0047,you know yes I was not I was not like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0048,bullshitting myself I was like oh okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0049,yeah so it was like you know you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0050,are you directing this map that's okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0051,describe your first impression of me
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0052,well let's see my first impression of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0053,you you're obviously dating Lauren okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0054,well you were dating my best friend and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0055,we were really young and I just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0056,remembered you were really really like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0057,funny and just full of energy and so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0058,naturally everyone's attracted to that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0059,type of personality so that was my first
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0060,impression just kind of like he's so fun
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0061,and he's like so cool I always thought
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0062,you were like so cool I was like he's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0063,like so cool yet cool friends
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0064,so like I read what I was like 15 that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0065,was technically for a suggestion
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0066,and then there was like another first
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0067,impression later wouldn't there be well
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0068,but that's my first impression that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0069,cool
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0070,what what's your three favorite memories
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0071,that we've shared mm-hmm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0072,should we wait for that plane since
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0073,there's like an airport right here hmm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0074,that's actually hard to choose in a good
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0075,way
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0076,the first one that comes to my mind I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0077,might like go out of order
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0078,chronologically it's like our first like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0079,turnaround trip to California when you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0080,got hired at done here and that was your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0081,first job there buddy to LA and a high
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0082,audition for the voice and made it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0083,season three and then we came right back
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0084,Oh week week or so later but that was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0085,like Taniya I was like that was a really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0086,strong memory I'm just like cuz it was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0087,like the start of like so much other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0088,stuff you know especially now I'm living
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0089,here over couple years let's see I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0090,that when we first started dating I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0091,remember when a very strong memory it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0092,was just like those it was like wine bar
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0093,that we first like and I was connected
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0094,no one to sorry
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0095,oh no no La Paloma it was more that La
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0096,Paloma was at the Starbucks
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0097,yeah we like I know unfortunately I was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0098,better coffee but know when we first I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0099,thought like hey let's have a business
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0100,meeting
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0101,and you shared all this really dope shit
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0102,about like your vision for I was like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0103,that I think that's when I was first
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0104,oh my god this is crazy like because you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0105,shared all this come credible like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0106,vision about like your beauty stuff and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0107,and I was like really like now I was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0108,like now you're like going because like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0109,really pumped because it's like about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0110,entrepreneurship stuff like all of your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0111,huge vision for like now you like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0112,surpassed all that stuff already anyways
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0113,for the most not really other than like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0114,the cool coloring book ideas really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0115,perfect yeah but like all that stuff I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0116,remember that was really strong I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0117,an obvious like oh we can go this fast
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0118,Tuesday when I proposed to you and you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0119,said yes to becoming my wife that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0120,pretty good that's my favorite you got
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0121,me you shocked me
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0122,I was that good one my turn that's right
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0123,no no no it's yours actually is it yeah
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0124,this is fun
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0125,when do you feel closest to me I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0126,that's a good question I think I feel
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0127,closest when and this could be an
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0128,interesting thing but like the first
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0129,thing that came to mind was when we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0130,might be disagreeing on something but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0131,you kind of I'm able to communicate with
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0132,you in a way that you understand and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0133,then you not necessarily compromise but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0134,you're just really sensitive and like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0135,understanding about it and I feel just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0136,like I'll thank God you know what I mean
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0137,so I feel like really close when you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0138,just like understanding whether or not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0139,maybe you agree or something like that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0140,but you're just kind of like okay honey
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0141,like data and I'm maybe that can be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0142,reciprocal but I feel like really close
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0143,to you at that point something yes it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0144,a win all right
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0145,right why does it feel like a win well
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0146,just that's cool that's good to know I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0147,like oh yeah take that I got it and we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0148,got a camera in case I forget it like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0149,said
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0150,just because I feel like I mean
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0151,obviously in any relationship the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0152,hardest thing is communication between a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0153,male and a female and just understanding
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0154,each other and what kind of things are
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0155,extremely upsetting to me that maybe
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0156,aren't upsetting to you but for you to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0157,just step back and go okay this doesn't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0158,really make sense to me but like I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0159,going to I guess yeah maybe the word is
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0160,compromised and just understand that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0161,it's not about like you know I don't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0162,have to understand and the fact that you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0163,just kind of let it I don't know I don't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0164,explain it but you know I mean like when
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0165,we just kind of come to some sort of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0166,resolve yeah I'm still wearing that well
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0167,we both are yeah but I think that that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0168,when and we're getting better and better
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0169,I thought which is great and I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0170,that that's and I feel closest cuz I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0171,like we can do this yeah okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0172,what do you think is the hardest thing
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0173,for me right now
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0174,that's big what do you think the hardest
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0175,thing for me what do you think is the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0176,hardest thing for me right now mm-hmm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0177,I guess it's like let's see I think that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0178,well I guess there's a few different
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0179,things that's like a let's see what do
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0180,you think that means to you though no no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0181,I think practically
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0182,you know like obviously right now where
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0183,things are at like there's so much great
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0184,stuff that we've been building and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0185,obviously like and I knew it was the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0186,right thing like to get engaged
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0187,obviously we both feel like a strong
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0188,sense of peace for that but I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0189,what's probably hard is fully like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0190,trusting the process because not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0191,everything's like in order you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0192,right now I'm learning to trust more and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0193,more than me probably he's really hard
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0194,and more and more and you know God and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0195,he's leading us to which can seem really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0196,really psychotic at times and really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0197,unreliable and like completely the exact
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0198,opposite of like what most stable people
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0199,would do and insane people would do yeah
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0200,I bet you that's hard being with an
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0201,insane person but like you know I can
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0202,imagine no I wear that sometimes I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0203,sure I do I wear that sometimes I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0204,thinking like wow that's got to be so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0205,hard for her because I don't know me and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0206,obviously I you know me but you know I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0207,always worry about that like being
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0208,difficult to be like me I can probably
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0209,have the worst I can have like this and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0210,that that and I think even in your your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0211,own self to you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0212,entrepreneurial goals and your own
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0213,career goals and life goals and things
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0214,like that so the gap between like it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0215,feeling like it's really really close
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0216,and not a time especially like right
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0217,right now specifically the director of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0218,the cards that's that makes sense um
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0219,started
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0220,what are you hesitant to tell me I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0221,like at this point I mean I think these
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0222,conversations kind of come up a little
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0223,bit but I get hesitant to imagine your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0224,career as a musician blowing up just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0225,because it's scary it's like there's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0226,like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0227,like all the things like because I know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0228,the music is so good I love it but it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0229,just hard because I see like how just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0230,these men just become like completely
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0231,like like sex and bulls in like they're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0232,just like so the attention is all on
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0233,them and so I obviously just struggle
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0234,with so much insecurity as it is so -
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0235,like even think about all these eyes
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0236,like on you and just like mm-hmm that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0237,lifestyle is just so tough so like for
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0238,us because we've like struggled past
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0239,with just like so much shit then it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0240,just scary to me and I know that like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0241,our relationship is solid and like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0242,obviously being engaged is helpful but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0243,it still doesn't a gate the fact that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0244,like I just get so worried that like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0245,don't know you know like I don't know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0246,like that's it's just like so hard cuz I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0247,want to be so supportive and I am but at
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0248,the same time it's like I get hesitate
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0249,cuz I'm like well yeah but what about my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0250,career like I want my stuff to blow up
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0251,and like you have this whole energy like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0252,around your team and and just like a lot
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0253,of our stuff parallels so much so then
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0254,it's like and we've kind of talked about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0255,this but like just I just don't want to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0256,be left in the dust of like your music
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0257,blowing up and then you just being like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0258,oh yeah well I make youtube videos and I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0259,know that financially if that does
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0260,happen for you cuz then I could just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0261,like kind of do whatever I want and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0262,produce shit like this which is what I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0263,want but that's just like yeah scary
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0264,like all of it scary to me just other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0265,girls and like all that shit like the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0266,music industry is just so gross so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0267,that's like thankfully like we're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0268,Christians and like all that I know will
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0269,be different
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0270,it's just hard okay thank you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0271,it turns out you won like it's just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0272,gonna be shitty if like like you've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0273,already seen how I get with like other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0274,girls so like it's gonna be hell I feel
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0275,bad for that like if I see any I'm like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0276,uh-uh don't even like freaking flip out
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0277,that's what I said I said no there's no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0278,girls and I'm like that's not happening
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0279,what could I do to improve our
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0280,relationship
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0281,it's nice what could you what could I do
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0282,so what can you do what can I do what
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0283,can you do I think just in general like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0284,I said to you before and it's obviously
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0285,like you know with not a sturdy past
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0286,that's pretty late to leaner and I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0287,understand that but just like what I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0288,know and like where I'm at like even
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0289,like in my heart and when I see for both
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0290,like I think what could really improve
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0291,our relationship and just you in general
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0292,would just be like I think just really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0293,taking a chance to trust me more Milan
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0294,things and you know you have a you're a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0295,strong woman you know and you have a lot
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0296,of tendencies to like do things on your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0297,own and I think you're learning more to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0298,like find the value in that and I just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0299,think like the world would open up you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0300,know in our relationship I think if
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0301,there was a deeper level of trust like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0302,we continue to like explore you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0303,what I mean
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0304,and I want that I want that like full
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0305,confidence we just like you don't have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0306,to like kick and scream sometimes and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0307,like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0308,because I'm like getting back of my head
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0309,I'm just like shaking my head to say
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0310,like seeking to understand you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0311,because that's a half of that I'm like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0312,you understood and you could show me
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0313,that you can understand where I'm coming
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0314,from me you would see that I'm swimming
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0315,you know you can see that how i'm having
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0316,your best interest their heart more than
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0317,i think i get credit for but it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0318,changing that's the what i'm saying i'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0319,even recently i'm seeing like total
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0320,shifts who knew that that finger was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0321,like the magic ring you know just in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0322,general like allowing that space to like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0323,right yes oh I guess the bottom of the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0324,barrel is good I said am I the best sex
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0325,you've ever had
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0326,oh cool seriously no but my hey
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0327,background no no not like that but I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0328,just mean like the answer is clearly you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0329,remove me from the darks - I saw the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0330,light
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0331,it's so embarrassing like that should be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0332,like no you like you like helped out the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0333,King where do you want to expand that no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0334,okay well there you have it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0335,when do you get jealous of me being with
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0336,others um I'm not as you know I'm not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0337,like the jealous type
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0338,in general when I I'm really not maybe I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0339,should be more sometimes no because um I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0340,think there's times if I do get jealous
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0341,it's a number like time because I like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0342,spending time with you and where I get
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0343,most jealous if it's like you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0344,something or someone or even if it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0345,like something you know stressful or
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0346,whatever that's like taking you away
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0347,from the lake sometimes anything makes
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0348,you feel like you can it's not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0349,necessarily people I'm like I would
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0350,never worry about late if he went on
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0351,camera yeah that question probably
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0352,would've been better if it was for me
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0353,my and maybe yeah I don't really I guess
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0354,it's a good thing you know but I'm just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0355,not like that anyways I might just get
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0356,jealous when I get sent on work trips to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0357,Disney World in your case yeah that is
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0358,fair enough I'm just like that's dumb I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0359,should go yeah for four days in Disney
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0360,World for work I definitely could be a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0361,part of that I got yeah
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0362,do you know just ask one no I'm good at
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0363,this what's the biggest sacrifice you've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0364,made that I haven't acknowledged that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0365,a good question the biggest sacrifice
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0366,that I've made that you haven't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0367,acknowledged yeah what's the biggest
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0368,sacrifice you've made
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0369,I mean cuz I feel like I've definitely
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0370,made lots of sacrifices and that was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0371,vice versa but I think that you do a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0372,really good job of acknowledging it but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0373,I'm trying to think of one that like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0374,feel like you have anything or maybe not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0375,I know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0376,I mean maybe I mean like this is like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0377,kind of silly but like the thing that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0378,comes to mind I mean like I think again
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0379,we'd like to discuss this but maybe like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0380,a big sacrifice has been just having you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0381,and Gracie you know sharing my space
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0382,which is your dog so having you and now
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0383,we have two dogs and two humans in my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0384,room and obviously really sharing that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0385,space right now and so I think that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0386,that's I mean but you pretty much
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0387,acknowledge it for sure like we've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0388,talked about this but I think because
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0389,like what I'd create is a lot of the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0390,times from my room and so I think that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0391,just like so stressful to try and feel
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0392,inspired to like film in that space when
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0393,there's just not which I'm so glad we're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0394,moving but I think that's like probably
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0395,one of the biggest sacrifices in the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0396,last its I'd say like few months for
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0397,like year whatever but yeah this was on
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0398,the I wrote gonna see my penmanship yeah
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0399,it's a lot different than than
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0400,penmanship on these curtains I see
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0401,I mean something I don't know what is it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0402,okay whatever just a secret that you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0403,have been afraid to tell you yeah but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0404,let's get juicier I know you're not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0405,gonna tell me what I want to know like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0406,so why don't you just ask me the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0407,question I don't know like that's what
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0408,I'm saying it's obviously there's stuff
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0409,that I don't know so what is something
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0410,that you're like she doesn't need to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0411,know that yeah I feel like I don't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0412,really have any like secrets like we've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0413,kind of already been there and covered
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0414,that stuff it's like I don't really like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0415,keeping secrets if you were like ask me
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0416,like a point-blank question I could be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0417,like okay okay then what's something
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0418,specifically in the last couple years
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0419,that you've never told me that you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0420,I would be upset about or you've been
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0421,like not telling me just because you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0422,trying to protect me being sad or that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0423,that's such a loaded question I'm like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0424,getting myself like in trouble yeah I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0425,mean like the only thing that comes to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0426,my mind was like just all that the time
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0427,where I was like my taking time with
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0428,like the ex situation and I'm just like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0429,brushing a lot of I just wanna dismiss

Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0431,yeah so I was like for me I was like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0432,trying to think about that and at the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0433,same time like knowing that really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0434,knowing her like we had much more like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0435,at stake was like put me in an
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0436,interesting position because it's like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0437,all right like you know if it was like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0438,okay

Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0442,to like self cracked one way or another
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0443,and being authentic about that but also
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0444,being out and about like I knew in my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0445,heart like it was gonna work itself out
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0446,like between you and I but it was just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0447,like a really weird time so I like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0448,obviously I'm smoothing over things
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0449,about your things like you know like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0450,communication or hearing from her or
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0451,whatever okay yeah okay here you go

Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0463,wait too that you know at all so my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0464,curiosity this is a specific question
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0465,but over the past three years that we've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0466,been dating on and off three plus years
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0467,that we've been dating on and off while
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0468,we were off did you date or what if you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0469,know that once well maybe I mean I was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0470,making once that was like maybe I don't

Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0472,I don't know wait a minute wait a minute
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0473,I like to remember no wait no but really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0474,it was like nothing to be worried about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0475,when was this a long time ago I was when
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0476,I was living in moral a drive house I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0477,think I don't like have to think about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0478,it just Megan you didn't kiss any other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0479,girl but that's your next girlfriend
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0480,yeah but I was like not even oh come on
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0481,what's weird because it was like you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0482,not yeah but you are off really right so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0483,you're entitled to a girlfriend because
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0484,it's a girl and so it's fine
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0485,no that's not how it works what happened
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0486,oh you did Wow like how long ago what's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0487,a long time that could be like three
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0488,weeks or something out the longer no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0489,like literally it was when we weren't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0490,even living out here yet and you and I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0491,were just starting to talk so he said
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0492,since we've been off and on
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0493,that's like the Marley Drive that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0494,doesn't make sense
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0495,I don't remember I don't remember I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0496,honestly I just remember I there's that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0497,there's that weird nervous laugh no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0498,really I'm like trying to piece it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0499,together I I thought no I'm really I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0500,not lying I swear to God I think it was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0501,during the time when I came out here to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0502,visit because I remember going it was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0503,I'm getting confused because we also
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0504,hung out once
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0505,the Marley Drive house but it was not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0506,even like that so I think it was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0507,actually before I moved out here and I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0508,was visiting for my birthday actually
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0509,it's weird you have such a detailed
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0510,specific memory I just say yeah no I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0511,mean I would
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0512,I'm answering I think you don't know is
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0513,your verdict is because there was not a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0514,big deal
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0515,oh that's how ass yeah I'm answering the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0516,question so did you go on a date with a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0517,girl yeah no they all asked still okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0518,know if anyone it was not female so you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0519,would have to be worried about what you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0520,knew that that's not anything like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0521,honestly that's not what you should have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0522,been worried about when we were not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0523,together it was the other guys that I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0524,was dating that's what I'm worried about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0525,huh that's not what I was worried about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0526,I know I don't know why okay that's was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0527,curious me I would be a lot more concern
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0528,about guys which now is not a problem
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0529,but like I don't know why you put too
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0530,much focus on that kind of stuff cuz it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0531,doesn't matter well it matters in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0532,certain in certain moments I like still
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0533,like it still lingers a little bit as
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0534,far as like attracting the girls but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0535,there's no action but it's still curious
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0536,I'm still curious about it because it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0537,still present in some way or another I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0538,not like worried about it like as far as
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0539,if the relationship but it definitely
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0540,don't have like this like fluid
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0541,attraction and males are involved
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0542,females are involved and you're involved
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0543,you would be like what the fuck
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0544,what so I was out we I'm you're not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0545,gonna get a what the fuck out of me
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0546,you're gonna get fill me fill in the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0547,blanks
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0548,no question like you know empathize if
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0549,you either and I'm like I come left with
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0550,like all right you know and so in some
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0551,situations because I'm kind of like okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0552,I think I understand but then there's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0553,like little curve balls that come where
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0554,I'm just like Kaylee fill in the blanks
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0555,you know Mike help me understand more
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0556,because I obviously can't relate to that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0557,in a parallel way you know so it's like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0558,that's why I wrote that question not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0559,about me because I'm actually glad it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0560,about that cuz that's an easy answer
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0561,then questions about when you and I were
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0562,off and I was doing other people so I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0563,glad that's one thing like that's not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0564,even anything to be worrying about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0565,okay so what should I worry nothing
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0566,that's a different question that you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0567,didn't get and we were stuck no you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0568,should be worried now I'm saying in the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0569,past yeah there was a lot to be worried
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0570,would you share you just avoid you just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0571,evaded my entire question and just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0572,rerouted it to something that was it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0573,irrelevant to me in this question like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0574,asked you that for a reason you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0575,okay what is the question well yeah okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0576,so the answer's no have you been dating
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0577,on our did you go on a date and worry
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0578,physical with if you don't know we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0579,technical answer's no that's saying like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0580,even just recently there's been
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0581,conversations about like you and you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0582,attracting females and that's something
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0583,that's a concern to me like what you do
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0584,with what you choose to tell me about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0585,the people you've dated other people you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0586,told me about other people didn't talk
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0587,to you I mean you think it's relevant
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0588,I'm like to me that's something that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0589,curious
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0590,I'm genuinely curious about because I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0591,like I don't understand it right well
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0592,that's a different question
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0593,okay okay that's not the question you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0594,asking the question the answer to that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0595,is no okay but if you're asking a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0596,different question of like should I be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0597,concerned when we're married if you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0598,going to watch you know me with a girl
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0599,or something that's how it is
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0600,well then what's the question yeah I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0601,mean if ever a spinoff of that question
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0602,will just be like explain that it's more
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0603,open than anything I'm not like saying
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0604,yes or no cuz yes or no it's easy it can
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0605,be like technically speaking no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0606,technically speaking yes but the nuance
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0607,that's important it's a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0608,like the details you know the tell us
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0609,the details and most things so it's like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0610,if I'm seeking to understand you and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0611,that's a part of you that seems very
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0612,like suppressed at times but they it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0613,pops up in what's wrong but I'm okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0614,like whatever
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0615,you know I still curious about it it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0616,still a part of you you can't like fully
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0617,oh do we need a timeout
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0618,and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0619,yeah do we just continue over that song
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0620,okay anyway yeah it's just thank you for
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0621,me it's like that but to me and like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0622,what's interesting more than like our
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0623,concern just like things that I don't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0624,know about they just get like it's a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0625,part of you obviously yeah I don't think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0626,I brush them to the rug at all like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0627,think I'm pretty open with you like I've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0628,said in the past I think you think about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0629,it a lot more than you think then you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0630,speak a lot like you might be processing
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0631,it and I think there's certain times
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0632,even when I hear you sharing I'm like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0633,think in your mind you're like think you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0634,talk about a lot more because you would
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0635,just say little it's like a bit like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0636,little sparse things and I kind of have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0637,to like puzzle piece in there there cuz
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0638,it's like one little thing in your head
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0639,you have all the details but it's like a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0640,little like tiny little thing that you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0641,say and that's the only thing I hear but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0642,your mind like how do you not know like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0643,I totally said that cuz you say these
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0644,little things out of context but it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0645,like I don't know what's underneath that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0646,you know so you just get little pieces
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0647,of things and I have to try to jumble
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0648,them together and make my best
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0649,assessment of what that means purse is
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0650,like right okay so that's a lot of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0651,rambling but what is the actual question
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0652,cuz I guess I don't really understand
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0653,what's going on because I'm like if you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0654,if you want to ask us it's okay like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0655,said where did that how does that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0656,resolve like there's obviously you still
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0657,like a uncertainty in you - I'm just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0658,like wondering what that means to you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0659,I mean I was having this conversation
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0660,with Nick Palacios just recently like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0661,think that's why our dynamic is so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0662,unique just because I feel like I found
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0663,the perfect partner because you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0664,understand we even talked about this I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0665,feel like last night just like how in my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0666,experience and I feel like several other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0667,people's experiences like sexuality can
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0668,be very fluid and it doesn't have to be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0669,like oh you know I'm gay I'm lesbian I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0670,bisexual
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0671,none of that I'm like no there have just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0672,been certain instances where I'm like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0673,attracted to that person and it's caused
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0674,me not only just like a lot of really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0675,fucked up hurt and stuff like that cuz
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0676,it's just very confusing I knew
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0677,immediately when I met you I was like oh
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0678,I choose this person and I didn't know I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0679,mean for a while I was like maybe I will
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0680,end up with a woman I was open to that a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0681,long time ago but now after meeting you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0682,it was like I definitely know like you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0683,had me at hello I knew that that wasn't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0684,an issue anymore so it's not a matter of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0685,oh well that's dead now it's just like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0686,no I choose you and I would never do
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0687,anything to like fuck that up at this
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0688,point you know I mean like in the past
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0689,there I mean there was so much like it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0690,was so like this with us that that very
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0691,much could have been you know a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0692,dangerous place to be but I just am so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0693,grateful that God has moved us so long
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0694,and we're not there anymore
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0695,you know just because that's like a very
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0696,dark place to be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0697,- trust me what do you get okay what do
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0698,you get from your faith that supports
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0699,our relationship what do you get from my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0700,face that's what we share at the core
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0701,okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0702,what would make you leave me well I mean
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0703,at this point it have to be something
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0704,really major but since we're not married
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0705,yet
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0706,and that would be even tougher but I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0707,mean at this point I think it would have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0708,to be finding out if like you were lying
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0709,about stuff I guess
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0710,yeah I think yeah like if I found out
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0711,the like you know you're lying about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0712,stuff like with Maddie or whatever or I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0713,I don't know right you know which it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0714,would have not stuff from the past
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0715,necessarily but it would have to be like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0716,if there was stuff like because I asked
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0717,you that just recently you know you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0718,really not an issue and I trust that so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0719,but that or I mean going back to kind of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0720,like what I just get so emotional about
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0721,is just like if you take off and like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0722,you're this like whatever and you've got
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0723,this whole career in music and then you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0724,just kind of get lost in it which I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0725,don't see you doing at all but you just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0726,never know you know so like I mean I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0727,again I know you and I know right I mean
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0728,I think it's just hard for anybody but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0729,like yeah it has to be something like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0730,wild like that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0731,okay who has more power in our
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0732,relationship that's a weird question
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0733,I don't know I think just like with like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0734,stronger with strong personalities or
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0735,something we both have them but gigantic
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0736,biceps that's why we're this jacket yeah
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0737,yeah but not like you know not like a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0738,domineering way that's good no not like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0739,I'm like this no no I think I think just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0740,in general like maybe yeah long as
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0741,you're cool it's annoying if I would
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0742,have said me you're a girl those girls
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0743,those women they're like you're strong
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0744,independent woman I wear the pants in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0745,the relationship I'm like no please
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0746,that's a very bizarre for us it looks
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0747,better I think yeah you would
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0748,self-destruct if I wasn't like Carol I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0749,like yielding to like it's like less
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0750,stressful to like if you want to that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0751,so weird I'm just traditional Maui and I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0752,watched my mom well I think I'm more
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0753,comfortable making decisions and things
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0754,at times that's where I knew you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0755,better at making decisions
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0756,the world yeah okay okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0757,what is one experience you wish we never
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0758,had see that's I mean this is I feel
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0759,like this is such a universal question
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0760,cuz like everyone would say well oh but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0761,this is like how we got here today which
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0762,is true I would agree cuz I think it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0763,like what's the one thing I wish you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0764,didn't do but it's kind of interesting
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0765,questions like what's one experience you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0766,wish we never had it's kind of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0767,interesting I mean I think yeah I'm like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0768,I don't know I mean I wish that we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0769,didn't have to experience like you'd
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0770,like kind of your whole process of like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0771,trying to like I don't know like I just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0772,we now have to work through so much
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0773,because of like the past of you not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0774,really being I knew I knew that you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0775,loved me and I knew that it wasn't that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0776,you were unsure of me but I think you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0777,were maybe unsure of yourself and like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0778,certain things so I think that that just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0779,like cause such it's like taking ten
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0780,steps back because we had to go there
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0781,like we both knew that we loved each
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0782,other where you both knew that we would
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0783,get to this point but all the shit that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0784,went came with it was just like dating
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0785,other people and like it's just like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0786,silly but it's like again it's like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0787,that's kind of an interesting question
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0788,cuz it's like like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0789,like I wish we could have just taken
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0790,somewhat of a shortcut in some of it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0791,because it's like it was so stupid and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0792,it was just like it caused so much pain
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0793,that like didn't wasn't necessary yeah
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0794,and now that causes a breach in trust
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0795,you know yeah when like if you were to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0796,just listened from the beginning it was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0797,just like I cut off on like little
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0798,trails all over the place then but and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0799,then was annoying ironic thing is though
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0800,even is that I'm glad you figured it out
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0801,with Maddie for a little bit because
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0802,then I would have still won wondering
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0803,now yeah so I'm like I am so freakin
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0804,glad that that happened because I was
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0805,like okay in the background laughing
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0806,like I'm so stupid like I know that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0807,not gonna work but go ahead try just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0808,figure that out like if that's gonna
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0809,work
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0810,I mean it's painful but I'm just glad
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0811,that that happened now because I could
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0812,not be engaged now not knowing there's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0813,no way yeah not a chance
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0814,yeah I knew that's it oh no I don't all
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0815,right
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0816,well okay what do you wish you could
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0817,heal in me and what pain would you take
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0818,away
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0819,hmm I think I wish I oughta sleep ain't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0820,about disappointment or you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0821,distrust and even I think some of the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0822,stuff you touched on I'm even from my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0823,kids I like things that maybe like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0824,even the stuff that you shared when you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0825,were in a transition explained you got
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0826,heat from both sides against you so to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0827,me that's crazy what's your biggest
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0828,regret I mean I don't think this even
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0829,relates to us at all I think I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0830,when I look back at my time of just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0831,speaking of that whole thing of just my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0832,time of self exploration and figuring
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0833,out who I was and all of those things I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0834,think that I just don't I was just like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0835,yeah like I'd every pride and just like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0836,so open about it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0837,that I look back now older as an adult
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0838,or as a more mature adult now because I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0839,wasn't it open to technically um and I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0840,just regret now seeing what other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0841,parents have to go through with their
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0842,kids like all they want is the best for
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0843,their children so I think for my parents
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0844,it was just a huge slap in the face
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0845,because instead of doing my best to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0846,communicate
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0847,kind of what I was going through I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0848,I just was like honestly if you aren't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0849,with this than by and just like shut
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0850,them out for four years which obviously
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0851,is now not the case but still I just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0852,feel like that's like you know I don't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0853,really you know I'm not the type but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0854,like that's one thing that I look back
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0855,now and I go oh that was someone mature
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0856,just yeah like I should have been a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0857,little bit more sensitive to that and I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0858,see other people doing it now and that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0859,been a unique experience for me to be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0860,like hey but like think about your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0861,parents like I know that they're not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0862,trying to like be mean they just want
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0863,the best for you and that is scary for
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0864,your daughter too now and just be kind
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0865,of confused to suit to she is sexually
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0866,so I think yeah just not every gret not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0867,I think I did try and communicate I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0868,don't know it's just like such a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0869,interesting thing but I think at least
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0870,being a little bit more respectful yeah
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0871,instead of just putting all over okay
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0872,are we good
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0873,what do you think is the biggest
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0874,challenge of our relationship you really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0875,do I know that's kind of a similar
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0876,question that we have um do you think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0877,the biggest yeah I think that was very
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0878,similar I guess I could reiterate it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0879,though I think the biggest challenge of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0880,our relationship is that both of us and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0881,this is different answer to I think both
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0882,of us have such a strong faith and have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0883,such a strong commitment to like that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0884,but also I think we both have similar
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0885,points of empathy for people have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0886,nothing to do with that which is like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0887,we're kind of bridges I think in certain
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0888,ways where we've kind of fallen into I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0889,would never like label myself that but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0890,it just seems like where we are like you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0891,know working so heavily in the music
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0892,industry now and you working in like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0893,you know the industry as well in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0894,different facets and like it just seems
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0895,like we have like two very sometimes can
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0896,be very polar opposites worlds you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0897,what I mean they seem like it almost
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0898,like nemesis or something like that but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0899,we're kind of uniquely displaced like in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0900,both it just kind of happened that way
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0901,and I think we we both have an
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0902,understanding of these very different
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0903,paradigms and I think that will be a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0904,that's a really beautiful thing because
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0905,I'll always err on the side of like and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0906,you total you on the like humanity and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0907,just people like you know just being
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0908,humans and all the good stuff but you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0909,know a challenge could be like there are
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0910,very very bold very clear statements in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0911,our faith that sometimes like to buy
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0912,those people that we may be like shake
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0913,hands with you know and like have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0914,different yeah it works with so I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0915,that could be a challenge in our
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0916,relationship as we go on is there might
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0917,be like different opinions about who we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0918,are and what we're about Oh from both
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0919,sides and I think that's just like that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0920,is what it is it's just people that will
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0921,probably be a challenge now in probably
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0922,forever is what it is yeah a good thing
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0923,I don't think either of us struggle with
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0924,having opinions okay here we go last but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0925,not least for you Oh
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0926,read yours what are the next steps in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0927,our relationship
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0928,well next big step in our relationship
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0929,that's definitely a big step and the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0930,little steps leading up into that would
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0931,just be like thinking in a more peaceful
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0932,place like living lies and you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0933,planning all that stuff out but that's a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0934,big step and then I think our careers to
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0935,you know really being catalyst for each
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0936,other anything at what that looks like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0937,and where we're gonna like melt together
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0938,and help each other you know in
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0939,different areas I think that's those
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0940,career careers and obviously marriage
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0941,whatever order that comes in seems like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0942,they're kind of in parallel babies a lot
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0943,a lot of kids you're gonna change your
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0944,mind when you see when you see like the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0945,first child you're gonna be like I'm not
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0946,doing this service of the world if I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0947,don't make more of these little suckers
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0948,you know like just - yeah - good more
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0949,food just say some people are families I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0950,want a militia
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0951,I want a little army okay you can have
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0952,like our own soccer team got nice to her
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0953,own school that's not the point
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0954,what oh here's one okay what are maybe
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0955,two or three things what some advice if
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0956,I were to be a better man for you and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0957,better you know partner what are like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0958,two or three things like bits of advice
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0959,you can give me to be better for you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0960,I think I mean truthfully jeez I feel so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0961,fucking blessed because like probably
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0962,like I hit the jackpot because I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0963,that you are just I feel badly for other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0964,people honestly almost in every
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0965,relationship cuz I'm like most men are
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0966,not like you so I feel like you already
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0967,your mind is like way up here and like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0968,most men are just like like oh my god so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0969,annoying they know because I found out
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0970,much later we weren't dating whoever you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0971,dated anyway but I think so I just want
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0972,to like obviously highlight that because
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0973,I think that I'm I think I think we've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0974,talked about this to like you know you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0975,are in the right relationship when you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0976,need to feel lucky to have each other
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0977,but I definitely am like no I'm the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0978,lucky one for sure just because you're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0979,so like understanding and stuff and just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0980,emotionally intelligent like that's a
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0981,real thing and I think that a lot of
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0982,people don't know what that is and they
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0983,don't exercise that and run towards it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0984,and that's something I mean obviously
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0985,and even this type of setting I always
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0986,know that you're gonna be by my side and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0987,like we always challenge you know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0988,expanding our minds and that means like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0989,really cool but I think I mean just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0990,again like working on you know which we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0991,are already but just being sensitive and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0992,like different things that like you may
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0993,I don't need you to understand
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0994,necessarily but just if I'm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0995,communicating like hey that that really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0996,upsets me or whatever just being like oh
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0997,really sensitive to the point where you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0998,feel nauseated just because you're like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_0999,oh my gosh this is so stupid I hate
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1000,having to be like like baby her but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1001,there's certain things I'm like I don't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1002,care if you don't get why it that's me
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1003,but it does so just like from the for
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1004,okay I'm so sorry like instead of just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1005,being like it's not a big deal
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1006,I'm like no it is
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1007,and vice-versa I can take that on myself
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1008,but yeah I don't think they maybe be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1009,more sensitive I think just continuing
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1010,like I've said this before but always
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1011,just like being the leader spiritually
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1012,because I think I need that I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1013,you're a lot more spiritually I don't
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1014,know how exactly for that I just know
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1015,that what I see for my partner like the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1016,ideal partner for me is someone that's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1017,just constantly challenging me in my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1018,walk with God and just like initiate
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1019,like I agree with you and you've said
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1020,this in the past like that has to be
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1021,something that like you want to do on
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1022,your own which I do and I feel so
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1023,grateful that God has like gotten ahold
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1024,of my heart and I do seek that but as my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1025,partner and a leader of my home and my
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1026,future family like I just always want
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1027,you to be the one that's like hey you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1028,know its prey or like hey like they're
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1029,just little things like that and like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1030,let's start our morning devotional like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1031,all those things that like I definitely
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1032,want for us I think if you were the one
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1033,leaving that I would get like excited
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1034,about that okay that's great I think it
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1035,could be something to not do as well
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1036,yeah okay well here's one so I think
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1037,just like you know I think I'm just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1038,being sensitive to the fact that like I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1039,mean and I I relate to this too but I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1040,guess it's different because it's coming
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1041,from a different dynamic but you're just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1042,a very friendly guy and I think we've
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1043,talked about this in the past my dad's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1044,very friendly he was in the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1045,entertainment business as well but never
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1046,letting anyone confuse that for you
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1047,flirting because I don't want any eyes
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1048,on any side whether it's that female
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1049,thinking that you're flirting because
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1050,we're being too friendly or whether it's
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1051,other people in the room
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1052,thinking that that's the case just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1053,because that's like so frustrating so I
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1054,think just oh and I think you are really
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1055,good about that definitely but just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1056,again in the future like oh just like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1057,around so many different thing and we
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1058,both are so I'm taking this unlike
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1059,reciprocating and we're both mirrors but
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1060,I think just like making sure that could
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1061,never be taken wrong ever you know what
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1062,I mean mm-hmm
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1063,even like respectful in the fact like no
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1064,number like nothing like just even like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1065,what kinda what we talked about the
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1066,other day
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1067,just like talk to linen about it cuz
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1068,that's the more respectful thing to do
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1069,it's hard because we're like young and
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1070,in LA and like networking and all those
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1071,things but like I just think it's tough
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1072,because that can be taken so wrong like
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1073,oh yeah like let me text it like I just
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1074,it's a tough thing but I think that
Man005_Woman005_Transcription_1075,that's
