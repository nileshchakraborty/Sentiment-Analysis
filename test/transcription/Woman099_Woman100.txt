Woman099_Woman100_0049,individual to to doing so much you know
Woman099_Woman100_0050,I'm saying you know it has to take hurt
Woman099_Woman100_0051,you know something tragic to happen in
Woman099_Woman100_0052,order for you to gain your strength you
Woman099_Woman100_0053,know and me personally Tasha I'm proud

Woman099_Woman100_0057,put only one adventure to go and here
Woman099_Woman100_0058,you are you know I'm saying but it's
Woman099_Woman100_0059,just sad that it has to take you know
Woman099_Woman100_0060,Travis Jeter for all this to happen you
Woman099_Woman100_0061,know you know for me I like I say it all
Woman099_Woman100_0062,the time I never thought I know that I'm
Woman099_Woman100_0063,a great mom but I never thought that
Woman099_Woman100_0064,losing my son would turn me into
Woman099_Woman100_0065,advocate is wrong and I love doing that
Woman099_Woman100_0066,job I mean what it's just my passion you
Woman099_Woman100_0067,know yes what do you appreciate most
Woman099_Woman100_0068,about you about our friendship how we
Woman099_Woman100_0069,have never disagreed we never never
Woman099_Woman100_0070,argue we you know we might not speak
Woman099_Woman100_0071,every day right but when we do is like
Woman099_Woman100_0072,we've nothing is like we speak every
Woman099_Woman100_0073,single day yeah
Woman099_Woman100_0074,and I think why our friendship has grown
Woman099_Woman100_0075,and blossom so much as like I don't need
Woman099_Woman100_0076,to be in your face every day to know
Woman099_Woman100_0077,that you love me because I know that you
Woman099_Woman100_0078,love me and I know if I ever need you
Woman099_Woman100_0079,yeah that I could always pick the phone
Woman099_Woman100_0080,up you show a bit or ring the doorbell
Woman099_Woman100_0081,and yes for me right I know that right
Woman099_Woman100_0082,so that's like people think like oh the
Woman099_Woman100_0083,meaning of friendship is that you're in
Woman099_Woman100_0084,someone's face every day no it's not
Woman099_Woman100_0085,that because we don't really see each
Woman099_Woman100_0086,other every day and nobody would never
Woman099_Woman100_0087,even know that we don't even see each
Woman099_Woman100_0088,other every day
Woman099_Woman100_0089,no private color we can see every day
Woman099_Woman100_0090,for what but we don't see one another
Woman099_Woman100_0091,every day like once in a blue moon or if
Woman099_Woman100_0092,we could in a function watch now there's
Woman099_Woman100_0093,no reason for you to have enough for me
Woman099_Woman100_0094,and be like okay I'm tired that's the
Woman099_Woman100_0095,entire show right what we have such a
Woman099_Woman100_0096,great friendship and more than that
Woman099_Woman100_0097,we're like sisters so that's all I feel
Woman099_Woman100_0098,yeah we're just like sisters you know
Woman099_Woman100_0099,and nobody can break that nobody because
Woman099_Woman100_0100,no kids grew for me the stomach - man
Woman099_Woman100_0101,have come and going and we're still
Woman099_Woman100_0102,standing right

Woman099_Woman100_0215,the pain in me you like to see um you
Woman099_Woman100_0216,like you like you like to heal like I
Woman099_Woman100_0217,would like the pain of your son to heal
Woman099_Woman100_0218,but I know the process
Woman099_Woman100_0219,I know healing is a process and it
Woman099_Woman100_0220,everybody heals differently you know and
Woman099_Woman100_0221,I don't expect you to heal now you know
Woman099_Woman100_0222,but as I said my friend you need my
Woman099_Woman100_0223,shoulder to lean on to cry oh and I'm
Woman099_Woman100_0224,always here for you Tasha but it is hard
Woman099_Woman100_0225,it is hard you know on yeah you just
Woman099_Woman100_0226,have to take a day by day you know I
Woman099_Woman100_0227,would like to see you get strong you
Woman099_Woman100_0228,know you take it you do the good job yes
Woman099_Woman100_0229,you doing a good job you know because as
Woman099_Woman100_0230,you say you was down you got back up use
Woman099_Woman100_0231,a fighter you use you strong if you did
Woman099_Woman100_0232,it yeah and you're still doing it like I
Woman099_Woman100_0233,tell people you have to allow me time to
Woman099_Woman100_0234,heal no don't you know they see the
Woman099_Woman100_0235,makeup and they might see me smile and
Woman099_Woman100_0236,they feel that I'm okay but internally
Woman099_Woman100_0237,I'm still healing of course you know
Woman099_Woman100_0238,because the worst possible thing
Woman099_Woman100_0239,happened to me with you know yeah and
Woman099_Woman100_0240,it's gonna take a minimum of me you know
Woman099_Woman100_0241,it's gonna take a minute for me to heal
Woman099_Woman100_0242,and that's why it's called grief yeah
Woman099_Woman100_0243,you know I take steps in healing because
Woman099_Woman100_0244,you know what like I tell people all the
Woman099_Woman100_0245,time it's my journey yeah this is my
Woman099_Woman100_0246,journey isn't you know it's not no one
Woman099_Woman100_0247,this is my journey and I'm walking my
Woman099_Woman100_0248,journey and I'm going to I know that I'm
Woman099_Woman100_0249,going to be here because I have enough
Woman099_Woman100_0250,you know so everybody who believes in me
Woman099_Woman100_0251,just have to just let me be now let me
Woman099_Woman100_0252,heal of course yeah definitely what's
Woman099_Woman100_0253,the most ridiculous thing I've done what
Woman099_Woman100_0254,did it teach you about me my emotion
Woman099_Woman100_0255,what isn't
Woman099_Woman100_0256,[Laughter]
Woman099_Woman100_0257,fighting poverty so many things what I
Woman099_Woman100_0258,dress because they don't even know what
Woman099_Woman100_0259,they allowing you to go live like you
Woman099_Woman100_0260,know my thing is there's so many things
Woman099_Woman100_0261,you know you just have fun and some
Woman099_Woman100_0262,people take it personally yes but I just
Woman099_Woman100_0263,know who you are and again like I said
Woman099_Woman100_0264,the most ridiculous thing is you go in
Woman099_Woman100_0265,life because you go in life is going to
Woman099_Woman100_0266,destroy so no you go in life I'm sorry
Woman099_Woman100_0267,like they don't even know what they did
Woman099_Woman100_0268,when they went live like oh my god no
Woman099_Woman100_0269,y'all gave her more room to be for you
Woman099_Woman100_0270,that I already know who you are so
Woman099_Woman100_0271,there's nothing that you do surprises me
Woman099_Woman100_0272,right it's like okay did she really
Woman099_Woman100_0273,that's the only thing I'd be like okay
Woman099_Woman100_0274,she really go there like if somebody
Woman099_Woman100_0275,doesn't know you they will take certain
Woman099_Woman100_0276,things personally but again again
Woman099_Woman100_0277,Facebook should've never went live I
Woman099_Woman100_0278,have to say about that so that's the
Woman099_Woman100_0279,most ridiculous thing a fake yes

Woman099_Woman100_0286,everything 100% and half of the time
Woman099_Woman100_0287,people don't like that because you know
Woman099_Woman100_0288,what you have a strong personality just
Woman099_Woman100_0289,like me yeah I have a strong personality
Woman099_Woman100_0290,yeah and some people you know handle

Woman099_Woman100_0295,crossing paths with the wrong people
Woman099_Woman100_0296,because they can't handle your
Woman099_Woman100_0297,personality but like I said the most
Woman099_Woman100_0298,thing it's like I said Facebook should I
