Man065_Man066_0001,ready when was the moment you knew you
Man065_Man066_0002,loved me at the time I don't think that
Man065_Man066_0003,I was like I love him per se but now in
Man065_Man066_0004,retrospect the moment when I knew that
Man065_Man066_0005,you were a keeper was when I had my
Man065_Man066_0006,seizure and the way that you responded
Man065_Man066_0007,to it
Man065_Man066_0008,why do you remember it every single
Man065_Man066_0009,thing I told you what to do and the fact
Man065_Man066_0010,that you like we had only been dating
Man065_Man066_0011,for like two months and you stayed
Man065_Man066_0012,totally calm and you carried me into the
Man065_Man066_0013,bathtub and like washed off my leg
Man065_Man066_0014,bleeding wounds cuz I hit the wall
Man065_Man066_0015,remember watching friends and you know a
Man065_Man066_0016,first date in your place and you carried
Man065_Man066_0017,me into bed and you let me sleep
Man065_Man066_0018,afterwards and you did I don't know
Man065_Man066_0019,watch TV and then I was like I'm gonna
Man065_Man066_0020,have sex with this guy that's pretty
Man065_Man066_0021,soon after we met that's like three
Man065_Man066_0022,months after that even is a good bar no
Man065_Man066_0023,that's really the first time when I was
Man065_Man066_0024,like this is a priceless like one in a
Man065_Man066_0025,million kind of person for sure that's a
Man065_Man066_0026,great thing what do you remember about
Man065_Man066_0027,the first time that we met I remember
Man065_Man066_0028,being nervous to meet you because I met
Man065_Man066_0029,you online and being like I don't know
Man065_Man066_0030,who this guy is
Man065_Man066_0031,and all I know that he once sweet so I
Man065_Man066_0032,hope this works out
Man065_Man066_0033,when I first saw you I remember being
Man065_Man066_0034,like whoa he's so much taller than I
Man065_Man066_0035,thought he was and that's coming from
Man065_Man066_0036,someone who's 6:30 and
Man065_Man066_0037,member seeing your eyes and being like
Man065_Man066_0038,they're crazy piercing blue which is
Man065_Man066_0039,something that I love but I did wish it
Man065_Man066_0040,you were blond did you like me I I did
Man065_Man066_0041,like you but you didn't pay any
Man065_Man066_0042,attention to me because you were only
Man065_Man066_0043,paying attention to Jess I know but I
Man065_Man066_0044,didn't know that I didn't know you so
Man065_Man066_0045,you were just like talking to her and I
Man065_Man066_0046,was like my part of this hello hi it
Man065_Man066_0047,wasn't until we were in that room in the
Man065_Man066_0048,in the museum when we were watching the
Man065_Man066_0049,short film by Murakami we were like
Man065_Man066_0050,sitting down next to each other in the
Man065_Man066_0051,dark that was like the first second when
Man065_Man066_0052,I was like holy shit I'm on a date with
Man065_Man066_0053,a guy usually this is my first
Man065_Man066_0054,impression of you it was just a holy
Man065_Man066_0055,shit he's so skinny that was like
Man065_Man066_0056,immediately because you had on the short
Man065_Man066_0057,above-knee seersucker shorts on that
Man065_Man066_0058,wasn't like a family crap well I didn't
Man065_Man066_0059,so depressed Oh like a year and a half
Man065_Man066_0060,so I hadn't eaten anything for No
Man065_Man066_0061,a year before you saw me yeah that
Man065_Man066_0062,Nicole Richie moment that's okay thank
Man065_Man066_0063,you honey
Man065_Man066_0064,yeah through our time of being together
Man065_Man066_0065,what event or memory has made you love
Man065_Man066_0066,me more
Man065_Man066_0067,I think it was probably that time when
Man065_Man066_0068,we came back from Evans house we were in
Man065_Man066_0069,the car and I was like crazy depressed
Man065_Man066_0070,and you played that Sam Smith song you
Man065_Man066_0071,were like this is the song that I
Man065_Man066_0072,listened to and this is like how I feel
Man065_Man066_0073,about what you're going through right
Man065_Man066_0074,now make it to me
Man065_Man066_0075,yeah and I had never heard the song
Man065_Man066_0076,before and you're like listen to lyrics
Man065_Man066_0077,like this is what I wish I could say but
Man065_Man066_0078,I don't know how to say or how to
Man065_Man066_0079,articulate by far the most romantic
Man065_Man066_0080,moment of my whole life
Man065_Man066_0081,even though we were just in the front
Man065_Man066_0082,seat of your car parked in front of a
Man065_Man066_0083,dumpster like with Boston rats running
Man065_Man066_0084,around no and but by far most romantic
Man065_Man066_0085,moment no question no question that's
Man065_Man066_0086,when I was like holy shit he's not
Man065_Man066_0087,leaving me this is real well I really
Man065_Man066_0088,didn't know how to help you and we were
Man065_Man066_0089,in couples therapy and I like had to
Man065_Man066_0090,like step away and be like okay I can't
Man065_Man066_0091,help you through this mm-hmm which is
Man065_Man066_0092,but the point was that you were willing
Man065_Man066_0093,to wait you were like take your time
Man065_Man066_0094,keep your head up and make it to me
Man065_Man066_0095,and I was like I don't know that was
Man065_Man066_0096,like an unfathomable kind of emotional
Man065_Man066_0097,gift like an offering from somebody I
Man065_Man066_0098,certainly didn't think I was ever gonna
Man065_Man066_0099,get in my life and so it was a real yeah
Man065_Man066_0100,that's the moment
Man065_Man066_0101,what are your three favorite memories
Man065_Man066_0102,that we've shared three favorite
Man065_Man066_0103,memories that's whatever jumps out is
Man065_Man066_0104,probably the right warrior just so many
Man065_Man066_0105,memories in seven years okay
Man065_Man066_0106,the first one that comes to mind is
Man065_Man066_0107,being on the plane and moving from LA to
Man065_Man066_0108,Boston and I like knowing that we have
Man065_Man066_0109,like fights suitcases and that we don't
Man065_Man066_0110,have a place to live and we both have
Man065_Man066_0111,never even been to Boston or
Man065_Man066_0112,Massachusetts for that matter and that I
Man065_Man066_0113,was like and I just looked over at you
Man065_Man066_0114,and I was like wow he's like committed
Man065_Man066_0115,to moving someplace that we've never
Man065_Man066_0116,been and that was just really fun for me
Man065_Man066_0117,it was frightening but definitely
Man065_Man066_0118,memorable fun second one was probably MX
Man065_Man066_0119,boyfriend jealous I was like it wasn't
Man065_Man066_0120,my boyfriend well he was your boyfriend
Man065_Man066_0121,for like a month
Man065_Man066_0122,it was like an infatuation okay you
Man065_Man066_0123,called him your ex-boyfriend because I
Man065_Man066_0124,was crazy and stupid whatever the title
Man065_Man066_0125,mate okay the point um I just thought it
Man065_Man066_0126,was fun that you wanted me to like be
Man065_Man066_0127,that guy and I was so scared to ask you
Man065_Man066_0128,remember in the car I was like oh by the
Man065_Man066_0129,way there's a party I'm going to would
Man065_Man066_0130,you move I'm so nervous and and just
Man065_Man066_0131,kind of like showing him showing off and
Man065_Man066_0132,he was like you know of course this
Man065_Man066_0133,sounds great well I thought awesome like
Man065_Man066_0134,this guy thinks I'm hot enough to like
Man065_Man066_0135,show up this guy over here
Man065_Man066_0136,so well not just a hot like awesome -
Man065_Man066_0137,it's gonna be like the best person at
Man065_Man066_0138,the party and I get to walk in with him
Man065_Man066_0139,so third one is for sure going to the
Man065_Man066_0140,Coldplay concert that was insane that
Man065_Man066_0141,was amazing and I really thought that
Man065_Man066_0142,like because we had the seats all the
Man065_Man066_0143,way in the back
Man065_Man066_0144,thought it was gonna said it was just
Man065_Man066_0145,gonna be horrible and it was the perfect
Man065_Man066_0146,seating right there in the front
Man065_Man066_0147,all those lasers and my favorite band
Man065_Man066_0148,all those well there's some lasers and
Man065_Man066_0149,life and Coldplay and it was perfect it
Man065_Man066_0150,was perfect I cried I laughed it was
Man065_Man066_0151,okay that's it okay when do you feel
Man065_Man066_0152,closest to me
Man065_Man066_0153,I think oddly enough when we're not
Man065_Man066_0154,together but I mean like when we're in
Man065_Man066_0155,the house like if we're just at home we
Man065_Man066_0156,don't have to be interacting with each
Man065_Man066_0157,other but just knowingly or in another
Man065_Man066_0158,room when you're doing your thing I'm
Man065_Man066_0159,doing my thing but this is what this is
Man065_Man066_0160,the life that we've made for ourselves
Man065_Man066_0161,this is what makes us happy were the
Man065_Man066_0162,kind of people who we don't have to be
Man065_Man066_0163,inundated with the other person's energy
Man065_Man066_0164,like constantly that kind of easygoing
Man065_Man066_0165,flow of like wow I have a real normal
Man065_Man066_0166,life that's when I feel closest to you
Man065_Man066_0167,for sure just being able to know that
Man065_Man066_0168,we're normal and no expectations of any
Man065_Man066_0169,kind of performance they're having to
Man065_Man066_0170,impressi or anything like that you
Man065_Man066_0171,always feel I need to impress me is that
Man065_Man066_0172,a bad thing
Man065_Man066_0173,I guess not you get fun perform be
Man065_Man066_0174,exhausting I find it exhausting for you
Man065_Man066_0175,I'm so used to it with everything in my
Man065_Man066_0176,life what are you hesitant to tell me
Man065_Man066_0177,I'm hesitant to tell you anything that I
Man065_Man066_0178,feel like would disappoint you because
Man065_Man066_0179,because even though we're married and
Man065_Man066_0180,it's a little bit different now that we
Man065_Man066_0181,are married but I guess before I just
Man065_Man066_0182,always thought that there would be
Man065_Man066_0183,something that or it could be something
Man065_Man066_0184,then I would do that maybe I was unaware
Man065_Man066_0185,of or that I would make you aware of and
Man065_Man066_0186,that it would be the one thing that
Man065_Man066_0187,would make you leave or the one thing
Man065_Man066_0188,that is like like crossing the line
Man065_Man066_0189,that's like too much yeah I mean there
Man065_Man066_0190,are just so many people that have like
Man065_Man066_0191,come in and out of my life and people
Man065_Man066_0192,that I love and it's been a motif and I
Man065_Man066_0193,didn't want that to be the case with you
Man065_Man066_0194,and and led to some pretty tough times
Man065_Man066_0195,with you not trusting me because I
Man065_Man066_0196,wasn't being completely forthright I
Man065_Man066_0197,read legitimate reasons man yeah that's
Man065_Man066_0198,when I'm like hesitant to tell you
Man065_Man066_0199,anything but now do you feel like you
Man065_Man066_0200,can tell me now I tell you everything
Man065_Man066_0201,everybody you know I don't yeah I mean
Man065_Man066_0202,hey I saw how it was hurting you
Man065_Man066_0203,it wasn't like beneficial I saw him like
Man065_Man066_0204,if I wasn't being 100% with you like I
Man065_Man066_0205,have to get you my all in order for you
Man065_Man066_0206,to give me your all and I was like yeah
Man065_Man066_0207,I didn't and I don't want to hurt you so
Man065_Man066_0208,I changed and now it's now I'll just
Man065_Man066_0209,stop not at all like it is it's great
Man065_Man066_0210,[Laughter]
Man065_Man066_0211,it was great before it zero but there's
Man065_Man066_0212,always room to grow things up right am I
Man065_Man066_0213,the best sex that you've ever had yes
Man065_Man066_0214,absolutely for sure because because of
Man065_Man066_0215,your body type because of how like
Man065_Man066_0216,masculine you are masculine is that what
Man065_Man066_0217,I said masculine masculine masculine
Man065_Man066_0218,esculenta great yeah the way you look at
Man065_Man066_0219,me and yeah everything I feel the same
Man065_Man066_0220,by far for sure like crazy connection
Man065_Man066_0221,right don't you think yeah how many
Man065_Man066_0222,times have we had sex and literally
Man065_Man066_0223,stopped and high-fived each other yeah
Man065_Man066_0224,right we're like been like holy shit
Man065_Man066_0225,like you go yeah I mind the best sex
Man065_Man066_0226,that you've ever had
Man065_Man066_0227,how is money a conflict in our
Man065_Man066_0228,relationship
Man065_Man066_0229,oh my god it's uh I wouldn't say it's a
Man065_Man066_0230,conflict I just think that both of us
Man065_Man066_0231,have a lot to learn when it comes to
Man065_Man066_0232,managing money for sure and we've been
Man065_Man066_0233,in situations where we've had no money
Man065_Man066_0234,and then we've had times when we've had
Man065_Man066_0235,a shit ton of money and never really
Man065_Man066_0236,managed it the right way so I think that
Man065_Man066_0237,we do need to work on managing it and
Man065_Man066_0238,budgeting it instead of saying let's
Man065_Man066_0239,make a budget this Saturday for five
Man065_Man066_0240,years straight but I wouldn't say that
Man065_Man066_0241,it's a conflict in our relationship
Man065_Man066_0242,would you I think it was a conflict in
Man065_Man066_0243,our relationship because of how much we
Man065_Man066_0244,were earning because of like your the
Man065_Man066_0245,waiting the Ronald's dynamics during the
Man065_Man066_0246,time when I thought it was about when I
Man065_Man066_0247,think it was a conflict in our
Man065_Man066_0248,relationship and that's because we moved
Man065_Man066_0249,and we hadn't lived with each other and
Man065_Man066_0250,one space with because we lived with
Man065_Man066_0251,other people yeah so we were on our own
Man065_Man066_0252,we were in a city on our own and I
Man065_Man066_0253,wasn't financially like supportive at
Man065_Man066_0254,all because I didn't know what I wanted
Man065_Man066_0255,to do and I couldn't hold a job and
Man065_Man066_0256,there were just power dynamics that were
Man065_Man066_0257,mixed in with moving being engaged and
Man065_Man066_0258,like figuring out who we are
Man065_Man066_0259,simultaneously they're like who's the
Man065_Man066_0260,word winner yeah who's the provider
Man065_Man066_0261,there became this thing of like status
Man065_Man066_0262,rather than like saddest I think rather
Man065_Man066_0263,than us like working together towards it
Man065_Man066_0264,you know what I mean yeah well our jobs
Man065_Man066_0265,were so different why you mean your job
Man065_Man066_0266,of my lack of a job no no I mean I mean
Man065_Man066_0267,the nature of my job at the time was
Man065_Man066_0268,very different from the nature of your
Man065_Man066_0269,job and it did bring in more money to
Man065_Man066_0270,our household but the biggest lesson
Man065_Man066_0271,that we learned from all of that is that
Man065_Man066_0272,it didn't make us any happier yeah at
Man065_Man066_0273,all no we got a baller TV but it
Man065_Man066_0274,now it's in a box so that's good we're
Man065_Man066_0275,not gonna look for money to make us
Man065_Man066_0276,happy as a couple we just need to learn
Man065_Man066_0277,how to be more adult about it you know
Man065_Man066_0278,managing it I agree yeah why haven't you
Man065_Man066_0279,given up on our relationship I'll
Man065_Man066_0280,preface this by saying that I have like
Man065_Man066_0281,definitely had doubts sometimes I know
Man065_Man066_0282,that you know but maybe I haven't been
Man065_Man066_0283,as vocal about it before but the one
Man065_Man066_0284,thing that always kind of sticks out in
Man065_Man066_0285,my mind is that there is nobody in my
Man065_Man066_0286,life who knows me better than you but
Man065_Man066_0287,also like I don't really know how to say
Man065_Man066_0288,it you you know me and you also will
Man065_Man066_0289,either change yourself or change my
Man065_Man066_0290,environment to accommodate whatever it
Man065_Man066_0291,is that I need to help me grow and you
Man065_Man066_0292,grow with me does that mean if it's this
Man065_Man066_0293,weird like almost level of respect where
Man065_Man066_0294,like I know that you respect Who I am
Man065_Man066_0295,and you see it and you like I don't know
Man065_Man066_0296,you're willing to change and adapt with
Man065_Man066_0297,me and in such a and it comes from such
Man065_Man066_0298,a loving place where you're like I see
Man065_Man066_0299,so much potential in you I see so much
Man065_Man066_0300,growth with you but I want to see it and
Man065_Man066_0301,I want to grow with you and watch it
Man065_Man066_0302,happen like I'm working you asked for it
Man065_Man066_0303,I'm your best friend yeah you are and
Man065_Man066_0304,that's what I say all the time you're my
Man065_Man066_0305,best friend
Man065_Man066_0306,what's the biggest surprise to you about
Man065_Man066_0307,being married anticlimactic they do
Man065_Man066_0308,really was right because it took us five
Man065_Man066_0309,years to get there I mean seven years in
Man065_Man066_0310,a greater sense of our relationship but
Man065_Man066_0311,five years right in those five years we
Man065_Man066_0312,were insane we would vacillate back and
Man065_Man066_0313,forth between saying like fuck marriage
Man065_Man066_0314,this is never gonna happen I don't want
Man065_Man066_0315,to ascribe to any of the like
Man065_Man066_0316,heteronormative like gender binary norms
Man065_Man066_0317,so that whatever all of that shit and
Man065_Man066_0318,then on the other hand we'd be like what
Man065_Man066_0319,colors do we want and what kind of
Man065_Man066_0320,flower do we wanna do blue orchids and
Man065_Man066_0321,do what and but never actually had a
Man065_Man066_0322,grasp of what it was going to be like
Man065_Man066_0323,but the fact that we did it just so
Man065_Man066_0324,suddenly so simple and so fast was
Man065_Man066_0325,surreal
Man065_Man066_0326,remember we walked out of the courthouse
Man065_Man066_0327,and we were like I'm married to you
Man065_Man066_0328,insane but I think what I learned what
Man065_Man066_0329,I've learned for a minute is that
Man065_Man066_0330,biggest surprise okay this is the
Man065_Man066_0331,biggest surprise thank you the biggest
Man065_Man066_0332,surprise is that there haven't been any
Man065_Man066_0333,surprises it's just what it has always
Man065_Man066_0334,been which is great that's why I wanted
Man065_Man066_0335,to marry you anyway so it's fantastic
Man065_Man066_0336,and I love that we don't fit into any
Man065_Man066_0337,standard like norms of what we're
Man065_Man066_0338,supposed to be now that we're married
Man065_Man066_0339,you know I'm not a groom and you're not
Man065_Man066_0340,a bride and you're not we're just we
Man065_Man066_0341,just got married yeah
Man065_Man066_0342,and thanks for getting back to the
Man065_Man066_0343,question is it my turn okay when do you
Man065_Man066_0344,worry about me and why okay when do I
Man065_Man066_0345,worry about you and why I worry about
Man065_Man066_0346,you when I see you criticizing yourself
Man065_Man066_0347,I think you can go into like a really
Man065_Man066_0348,dark space I think you can just
Man065_Man066_0349,completely spiral mm-hmm and there's and
Man065_Man066_0350,and I worry about you because there's
Man065_Man066_0351,nothing and no one that can get you out
Man065_Man066_0352,of that that is like you happen to like
Man065_Man066_0353,climb out of the rabbit hole and I'm
Man065_Man066_0354,like how long is this how long is it
Man065_Man066_0355,going to take it's so indefinite and I'm
Man065_Man066_0356,just and I've like worried about like
Man065_Man066_0357,you missing out on something during that
Man065_Man066_0358,time when mm-hmm like you could just be
Man065_Man066_0359,like moving forward and just going to
Man065_Man066_0360,the next step the part for that that's
Man065_Man066_0361,like wasn't like I guess just some
Man065_Man066_0362,degree still is hard for me is that I
Man065_Man066_0363,having to tell you that there's nothing
Man065_Man066_0364,you can do to help me mm-hmm and I'm
Man065_Man066_0365,seeing how powerless that makes you feel
Man065_Man066_0366,and how sad it makes you look and it's
Man065_Man066_0367,just terrible because if I could make
Man065_Man066_0368,you happier I would but there's just
Man065_Man066_0369,some times in life I'm like nobody can
Man065_Man066_0370,help you and I recommend and that took
Man065_Man066_0371,like the therapy like the Apple therapy
Man065_Man066_0372,that we wouldn't do like you that you
Man065_Man066_0373,weren't obligated to like fix everything
Man065_Man066_0374,about yeah where I had to like really
Man065_Man066_0375,take all the control out
Man065_Man066_0376,like okay like if he could he would I
Man065_Man066_0377,can see that he really does want to get
Man065_Man066_0378,out of it but does this history and I
Man065_Man066_0379,have to step back definitely changed a
Man065_Man066_0380,lot in that way we really do then we
Man065_Man066_0381,would have five years ago what is
Man065_Man066_0382,preventing me from happiness or becoming
Man065_Man066_0383,the man I want to be self-doubt no
Man065_Man066_0384,question self-doubt insecurity and
Man065_Man066_0385,constantly telling yourself or worrying
Man065_Man066_0386,that you're not gonna be good enough
Man065_Man066_0387,you're not gonna measure up you're not
Man065_Man066_0388,going to make people proud and it's
Man065_Man066_0389,insane because everybody in your life
Man065_Man066_0390,who loves you and knows you is like
Man065_Man066_0391,waiting for you to spread your wings and
Man065_Man066_0392,fly and become this amazing person that
Man065_Man066_0393,you're going to become but you still
Man065_Man066_0394,have this nagging insecurity that maybe
Man065_Man066_0395,he's from childhood or whatever like
Man065_Man066_0396,life experiences but it's just there's a
Man065_Man066_0397,cross train you it's crazy because
Man065_Man066_0398,you're the most wonderful person I've
Man065_Man066_0399,ever met and I'm like how could you be
Man065_Man066_0400,insecure it's just crazy
Man065_Man066_0401,but it's frustrating but not in a way
Man065_Man066_0402,where I get angry you I just get angry
Man065_Man066_0403,at whoever it was that is responsible
Man065_Man066_0404,for leading you to a place where you
Man065_Man066_0405,would doubt yourself in that way that's
Man065_Man066_0406,who I get angry at which is why I'm so
Man065_Man066_0407,defensive when your friends are
Man065_Man066_0408,ridiculous
Man065_Man066_0409,or if you have a friend or somebody
Man065_Man066_0410,who's being absurd you know and I'm like
Man065_Man066_0411,cut them out of your life you were
Man065_Man066_0412,better than that you're better than me
Man065_Man066_0413,that's the other I look at you is that
Man065_Man066_0414,you are exponentially a better person
Man065_Man066_0415,than I am just in general the--and i
Man065_Man066_0416,don't like that you think that way it's
Man065_Man066_0417,true it's not true mister objectively on
Man065_Man066_0418,paper it's true you filled out a
Man065_Man066_0419,questionnaire of like yes or no like
Man065_Man066_0420,basic things of like do you trust people
Man065_Man066_0421,are people inherently good all that kind
Man065_Man066_0422,of stuff I would be like everyone
Man065_Man066_0423,generally a good person and I like had
Man065_Man066_0424,better intent
Man065_Man066_0425,than you do but that doesn't make me a
Man065_Man066_0426,better person than you I guess by a
Man065_Man066_0427,better person I mean it enables you to
Man065_Man066_0428,live life more effectively so when you
Man065_Man066_0429,have the insecurities and I know you
Man065_Man066_0430,have that strength and that ability to
Man065_Man066_0431,be positive and optimistic and always
Man065_Man066_0432,see the glass is half-full that's when
Man065_Man066_0433,it drives me crazy because I'm like
Man065_Man066_0434,you're better than this
Man065_Man066_0435,you already are better than this it's
Man065_Man066_0436,not like oh you can work towards it like
Man065_Man066_0437,you are everything that you need to be
Man065_Man066_0438,to achieve what
Man065_Man066_0439,like all of your dreams at this point
Man065_Man066_0440,you already have all of it and you just
Man065_Man066_0441,have to realize that do you believe in
Man065_Man066_0442,the one and am i it what makes you
Man065_Man066_0443,believe in the one I do and I don't
Man065_Man066_0444,well I guess don't then right no I don't
Man065_Man066_0445,yeah don't I don't I believe that there
Man065_Man066_0446,are multiple people that you can have a
Man065_Man066_0447,connection with prefer I would have a
Man065_Man066_0448,different relationship with some other
Man065_Man066_0449,guy that is a directive because there
Man065_Man066_0450,are other attractive guys out there and
Man065_Man066_0451,he would relate to me in a different way
Man065_Man066_0452,and he could probably give me something
Man065_Man066_0453,else that's different other than you but
Man065_Man066_0454,you came along first and I was lucky
Man065_Man066_0455,enough to find you so why would I search
Man065_Man066_0456,for anyone else there's no other one for
Man065_Man066_0457,me right now because I am the one or
Man065_Man066_0458,even if there was I agree with you I
Man065_Man066_0459,think everybody is potentially
Man065_Man066_0460,compatible with any number of other
Man065_Man066_0461,people so it is kind of arbitrary
Man065_Man066_0462,whoever you end up with but yeah looking
Man065_Man066_0463,for the one puts so much pressure
Man065_Man066_0464,there's 7 billion people in the world be
Man065_Man066_0465,like you better find that 1 million
Man065_Man066_0466,it's not gonna happen it's absurd but
Man065_Man066_0467,yeah I agree with you if you find
Man065_Man066_0468,someone who is close to the one don't
Man065_Man066_0469,fuck it up that's what I get pissed like
Man065_Man066_0470,give it a chance
Man065_Man066_0471,now like the because I've decided to
Man065_Man066_0472,make you the one in my life right now
Man065_Man066_0473,but but because of it the connection and
Man065_Man066_0474,that we have now it's unmatched like I
Man065_Man066_0475,would not be able to find this with
Man065_Man066_0476,anyone and I think that's you might be
Man065_Man066_0477,just as happy with somebody else but it
Man065_Man066_0478,will be a different kind of difference
Man065_Man066_0479,this is absolutely unique and totally
Man065_Man066_0480,zoned and what's the greatest lesson I
Man065_Man066_0481,taught you I've taught you a lot okay
Man065_Man066_0482,what do you think you taught me the
Man065_Man066_0483,greatest but definitely patience that
Man065_Man066_0484,was the very first word that came into
Man065_Man066_0485,my head but the thing is I don't think
Man065_Man066_0486,that I've absorbed that no yeah I'm not
Man065_Man066_0487,a patient person and then I'm not good
Man065_Man066_0488,at patience but you have at least been
Man065_Man066_0489,I'm not sure if you've learned it it's a
Man065_Man066_0490,lesson I've given you but I'm not sure
Man065_Man066_0491,if you've learned it you've been a
Man065_Man066_0492,living example of a person who has a
Man065_Man066_0493,unbelievable amount of patience just in
Man065_Man066_0494,a way that I've never seen in anybody
Man065_Man066_0495,else like a bomb could go off people
Man065_Man066_0496,could be going completely out of control
Man065_Man066_0497,and you would be chill and fine and I'd
Man065_Man066_0498,be losing my shit and you're always just
Man065_Man066_0499,telling me to calm down it's gonna be
Man065_Man066_0500,okay and that's why for the beginning of
Man065_Man066_0501,our relationship for like the first two
Man065_Man066_0502,years I thought you were crazy I was
Man065_Man066_0503,like this guy's Sikh really fucked up
Man065_Man066_0504,and he just doesn't know it yet and
Man065_Man066_0505,we're gonna have some breakdown he's
Man065_Man066_0506,gonna be like and it's not it's totally
Man065_Man066_0507,real and inexplicable and I wasn't until
Man065_Man066_0508,I talked to my brother that he was like
Man065_Man066_0509,yeah some people are actually
Man065_Man066_0510,emotionally how
Man065_Man066_0511,some people actually aren't mentally ill
Man065_Man066_0512,and crazy like they're actually good
Man065_Man066_0513,people so what is the lesson that you
Man065_Man066_0514,learn patience and it yeah just that if
Man065_Man066_0515,not like I said like I'm not able to do
Man065_Man066_0516,it
Man065_Man066_0517,but if I hadn't met you or been with you
Man065_Man066_0518,I never would have valued it or had a
Man065_Man066_0519,desire to one day be a patient person
Man065_Man066_0520,like now I see that it's an integral
Man065_Man066_0521,part of my identity is i evolve as a
Man065_Man066_0522,person and that you're responsible for
Man065_Man066_0523,introducing that into my life because
Man065_Man066_0524,there was never any patients in my life
Man065_Man066_0525,growing up everything was so crazy all
Man065_Man066_0526,the time that's for sure so what do I
Man065_Man066_0527,give you that none of your other
Man065_Man066_0528,partners did things that I didn't really
Man065_Man066_0529,have any I only an update I was about to
Man065_Man066_0530,say date anyone out there so everything
Man065_Man066_0531,that I'm thinking is just pretty much
Man065_Man066_0532,sexual and you're my number one so so
Man065_Man066_0533,from my previous relationship
Man065_Man066_0534,I think it really didn't work because
Man065_Man066_0535,they well because he didn't really
Man065_Man066_0536,understand me and he didn't really see
Man065_Man066_0537,my potential to grow and didn't kind of
Man065_Man066_0538,like push the boundaries and be like
Man065_Man066_0539,okay well have you thought about it this
Man065_Man066_0540,wing approached it in that way so be
Man065_Man066_0541,like gay that means really good yeah
Man065_Man066_0542,exactly
Man065_Man066_0543,he just kind of saw my situation and he
Man065_Man066_0544,was like I really like him but I'm just
Man065_Man066_0545,gonna be on the outskirts of it and
Man065_Man066_0546,again we were only together for like
Man065_Man066_0547,three months so I didn't really have
Man065_Man066_0548,that much to go compared to yeah thanks
Man065_Man066_0549,for filling
Man065_Man066_0550,yeah I think that's pretty much it okay
Man065_Man066_0551,what would make you leave me
Man065_Man066_0552,if we have kids one day and that's
Man065_Man066_0553,something we've talked about that we
Man065_Man066_0554,like to do if our children were ever in
Man065_Man066_0555,a position where they weren't safe
Man065_Man066_0556,around you for any reason this is just
Man065_Man066_0557,obviously completely hypothetical that
Man065_Man066_0558,would be an instance no question where I
Man065_Man066_0559,would be like yeah my relationship even
Man065_Man066_0560,if I love this person it would take
Man065_Man066_0561,another person's life and another
Man065_Man066_0562,person's safety do you be compromised in
Man065_Man066_0563,addition to my home but it would have to
Man065_Man066_0564,be that it would have to be that day
Man065_Man066_0565,back to you - yeah because otherwise I'm
Man065_Man066_0566,willing to work through almost anything
Man065_Man066_0567,I mean if you kill somebody obviously
Man065_Man066_0568,you're gonna go to jail so I'll leave
Man065_Man066_0569,you in that but you would have to become
Man065_Man066_0570,a completely different person and that's
Man065_Man066_0571,just not what's going to happen not on
Man065_Man066_0572,my watch
Man065_Man066_0573,is that your turn reminder it's your
Man065_Man066_0574,turn okay what is the most ridiculous
Man065_Man066_0575,thing that I've done and what did it
Man065_Man066_0576,teach you about me the most ridiculous
Man065_Man066_0577,thing that you've done in seven years
Man065_Man066_0578,for sure is when I got the call from
Man065_Man066_0579,Allison and you locked yourselves out of
Man065_Man066_0580,the apartment and you climbed up onto
Man065_Man066_0581,the adjacent building then you got cut
Man065_Man066_0582,on the barbed wire razor wire great
Man065_Man066_0583,sorry press the difference razor wire
Man065_Man066_0584,and bleeding out on top of the roof up
Man065_Man066_0585,there having to climb down so ridiculous
Man065_Man066_0586,hollow mocks men do you know how
Man065_Man066_0587,expensive locksmiths are I was like I
Man065_Man066_0588,can do one hundred eighty dollars or I
Man065_Man066_0589,can take a chance in Hopson or I can
Man065_Man066_0590,have a star on my leg and bleed out and
Man065_Man066_0591,need to go to the emergency room
Man065_Man066_0592,I obviously didn't think that that was
Man065_Man066_0593,going to happen obviously and that nine
Man065_Man066_0594,that's what we got locked out we climbed
Man065_Man066_0595,up on the roof in the building next door
Man065_Man066_0596,and you helped me with Evan remember
Man065_Man066_0597,yeah so it wasn't the president was but
Man065_Man066_0598,it was different though because you had
Man065_Man066_0599,more support you tried to do this
Man065_Man066_0600,literally on your own
Man065_Man066_0601,yeah I panicked that's pretty much what
Man065_Man066_0602,it taught me which was that like he's
Man065_Man066_0603,like so headstrong that he'd like will
Man065_Man066_0604,do this on his own and try to handle it
Man065_Man066_0605,and it's a positive thing but it is a
Man065_Man066_0606,crazy crazy negative thing when it sends
Man065_Man066_0607,me to the emergency or the emergency
Man065_Man066_0608,room well we've been there many times
Man065_Man066_0609,they'll make sense to me it doesn't how
Man065_Man066_0610,it wasn't guaranteed but I was gonna
Man065_Man066_0611,splice my leg open if you completely
Man065_Man066_0612,take that option out of the table and
Man065_Man066_0613,you just call the locksmith
Man065_Man066_0614,it absolutely turns the table so that
Man065_Man066_0615,you don't have that scenario in front of
Man065_Man066_0616,you
Man065_Man066_0617,my phone was okay long as Alison had her
Man065_Man066_0618,phone also there's the liquor store that
Man065_Man066_0619,was below us use their phone
Man065_Man066_0620,you know them okay any crazy I have a
Man065_Man066_0621,wonderful scar in my leg thank you what
Man065_Man066_0622,do you think is the hardest thing for me
Man065_Man066_0623,right now
Man065_Man066_0624,continually believing in yourself like
Man065_Man066_0625,on a daily level reaffirming who you are
Man065_Man066_0626,and believing that your dreams are valid
Man065_Man066_0627,and that what you want to do with your
Man065_Man066_0628,career is valid and totally do a bowl
Man065_Man066_0629,that's what you struggle with but you
Man065_Man066_0630,have the ability to do it it's not that
Man065_Man066_0631,you have to cultivate that it's waiting
Man065_Man066_0632,there you just have to find a way to
Man065_Man066_0633,access it on a daily level that would be
Man065_Man066_0634,I think get ready to start already now
Man065_Man066_0635,I'm angry to be able to really kick off
Man065_Man066_0636,and finally get moving you know you're
Man065_Man066_0637,the only person who is holding yourself
Man065_Man066_0638,back always not always most of the time
Man065_Man066_0639,now but not always
Man065_Man066_0640,yeah there's a whole lot of fucking
Man065_Man066_0641,people holding you back that's true okay
Man065_Man066_0642,what's a mistake that you see me make
Man065_Man066_0643,repeatedly and why do you think that I
Man065_Man066_0644,do it
Man065_Man066_0645,[Music]
Man065_Man066_0646,and this diving headfirst into like
Man065_Man066_0647,whatever the newest fascination is
Man065_Man066_0648,whether it be taro or crystals or
Man065_Man066_0649,listening to an album or music artist
Man065_Man066_0650,and like completely resonating with it
Man065_Man066_0651,and what was a less viable question well
Man065_Man066_0652,why do I think you do it mm-hmm I think
Man065_Man066_0653,you're constantly trying to define
Man065_Man066_0654,things like it's a you're always a
Man065_Man066_0655,strategist and you're always thinking
Man065_Man066_0656,planning and like needing some kind of
Man065_Man066_0657,explanation for everything there has to
Man065_Man066_0658,be a reason and if there is I want to
Man065_Man066_0659,know it and I think yeah and I think you
Man065_Man066_0660,do it because you're just a kind of
Man065_Man066_0661,scientist of life I think you just
Man065_Man066_0662,really have a thirst insatiable thirst
Man065_Man066_0663,for knowledge and it just cannot be
Man065_Man066_0664,subsided I don't think it'll ever end so
Man065_Man066_0665,that's a mistake
Man065_Man066_0666,I think their mistakes I lose I see them
Man065_Man066_0667,as a mistake I don't think that you need
Man065_Man066_0668,it I think it's over complicated I would
Man065_Man066_0669,agree with that I think that for me not
Man065_Man066_0670,I think I know their coping mechanisms
Man065_Man066_0671,yeah it's just something to keep my mind
Man065_Man066_0672,busy because it's so out of control
Man065_Man066_0673,crazy I need something too and I'm live
Man065_Man066_0674,in the present life just live it totally
Man065_Man066_0675,but it's hard for me to be in the
Man065_Man066_0676,present moment and it's hard for you not
Man065_Man066_0677,to be in the present moment so this
Man065_Man066_0678,isn't about being this questions for you
Man065_Man066_0679,all right
Man065_Man066_0680,describe what you were like before we
Man065_Man066_0681,met how have I changed you
Man065_Man066_0682,I don't give him my background obviously
Man065_Man066_0683,and my my family and how religious and
Man065_Man066_0684,how oppressive their ideology and
Man065_Man066_0685,theology was I grew up in a world where
Man065_Man066_0686,I just never thought that I was gonna be
Man065_Man066_0687,able to have certain things I was never
Man065_Man066_0688,going to be able to get married to
Man065_Man066_0689,somebody without wondering what I was
Man065_Man066_0690,making a mistake I was never going to be
Man065_Man066_0691,able to be an authentic person I just
Man065_Man066_0692,had this whole life carved out for
Man065_Man066_0693,myself for all of these limitations of
Man065_Man066_0694,what my life would look like and then
Man065_Man066_0695,since meeting you and having a
Man065_Man066_0696,relationship with you and marrying you
Man065_Man066_0697,it's just surreal because I just never
Man065_Man066_0698,thought this would be a possibility for
Man065_Man066_0699,me or that members of my family would
Man065_Man066_0700,come around and actually support us and
Man065_Man066_0701,a huge part of that is you like it's not
Man065_Man066_0702,just because they were like oh I accept
Man065_Man066_0703,her now or it's because of the person
Man065_Man066_0704,that you are you are like the Golden Boy
Man065_Man066_0705,to bring home to people who you want to
Man065_Man066_0706,be like have a problem with our
Man065_Man066_0707,relationship
Man065_Man066_0708,meet this incredible person and then I
Man065_Man066_0709,dare you to talk shit about him like now
Man065_Man066_0710,you have to really critically think
Man065_Man066_0711,about like why you think relationships
Man065_Man066_0712,are or aren't morally correct you know
Man065_Man066_0713,what I mean like you were a prime
Man065_Man066_0714,example of it so you've changed me in
Man065_Man066_0715,the sense that I believe in so many
Man065_Man066_0716,other possibilities in my life now that
Man065_Man066_0717,I always thought were forbidden it would
Man065_Man066_0718,never happen and now I look at them and
Man065_Man066_0719,I'm like that's totally doable because
Man065_Man066_0720,I've made it this far I never thought it
Man065_Man066_0721,would be this person I never thought I
Man065_Man066_0722,would be married to a man who grew up in
Man065_Man066_0723,LA like I just yeah that's that's how
Man065_Man066_0724,you've changed me
Man065_Man066_0725,what do you think is the most important
Man065_Man066_0726,lesson that I'm learning at this stage
Man065_Man066_0727,in my life I think the most important
Man065_Man066_0728,lesson that you're learning is that you
Man065_Man066_0729,are allowed to take as much time as you
Man065_Man066_0730,need to get to where you want to be like
Man065_Man066_0731,to be you're allowed to be selfish
Man065_Man066_0732,you're allowed to completely just go off
Man065_Man066_0733,the radar and do whatever it is that
Man065_Man066_0734,makes you happy in order for you to get
Man065_Man066_0735,to the next stage in your life I think
Man065_Man066_0736,it's I think it's necessary and vital
Man065_Man066_0737,for you to like appreciate this time I
Man065_Man066_0738,think it's I I just don't know how much
Man065_Man066_0739,more selfish I could be that's the
Man065_Man066_0740,problem where I'm like I already feel
Man065_Man066_0741,like a pretty selfish person I know but
Man065_Man066_0742,and I think I think it's I think it's
Man065_Man066_0743,good for you I think you've always tried
Man065_Man066_0744,to please somebody else or be somebody
Man065_Man066_0745,else for other people and this is
Man065_Man066_0746,allowed you to like create the space
Man065_Man066_0747,where you can do or be whatever you want
Man065_Man066_0748,to be and you need at that time a long
Man065_Man066_0749,period of time yeah and it's gonna end
Man065_Man066_0750,up being like two years but two years
Man065_Man066_0751,and like and that's why I'm like I think
Man065_Man066_0752,of it differently like in two years in
Man065_Man066_0753,the grand scheme a bit like I'm married
Man065_Man066_0754,you're all are gonna have an entire life
Man065_Man066_0755,like our 30 year anniversary we're not
Man065_Man066_0756,gonna think about the two years that you
Man065_Man066_0757,were like taking this time to find
Man065_Man066_0758,yourself and you know figure out what it
Man065_Man066_0759,is that you want to do I know you want
Man065_Man066_0760,to be well we probably will but it won't
Man065_Man066_0761,be in necessarily I won't be in like
Man065_Man066_0762,it's just weird now and we're young and
Man065_Man066_0763,we're constantly analyzing who we are
Man065_Man066_0764,what we're going to be that's true
Man065_Man066_0765,because we look back that stuff from
Man065_Man066_0766,like five years ago whatever and we're
Man065_Man066_0767,like oh my god we were so stupid so
Man065_Man066_0768,we're probably gonna say the same same
Man065_Man066_0769,thing we're just always gonna think that
Man065_Man066_0770,we were really my life will finally be
Man065_Man066_0771,living in a house and I will finally
Man065_Man066_0772,have whatever job that it is related to
Man065_Man066_0773,art or having my own company or brand
Man065_Man066_0774,and then we're just gonna be sitting
Man065_Man066_0775,having a glass of wine be like remember
Man065_Man066_0776,when I totally lost my shit and I went
Man065_Man066_0777,to McClean and then I had to be checked
Man065_Man066_0778,into a mental health facility and I went
Man065_Man066_0779,off the radar didn't want to be anyone
Man065_Man066_0780,and pulled up in the house the entire
Man065_Man066_0781,time and we'll just like laugh about it
Man065_Man066_0782,you have to yeah that's crazy
Man065_Man066_0783,okay what could I do to improve our
Man065_Man066_0784,relationship
Man065_Man066_0785,stop texting and driving stop listening
Man065_Man066_0786,to your music and picking your music on
Man065_Man066_0787,your phone for the nine thousandth time
Man065_Man066_0788,past the iPhone to me and I will pick
Man065_Man066_0789,these songs our relationship yeah I be
Man065_Man066_0790,grateful that it's something so shallow
Man065_Man066_0791,because surely I was racking my brain
Man065_Man066_0792,but that's the only thing where I'm like
Man065_Man066_0793,that makes me want to go crazy that
Man065_Man066_0794,would make things much nicer because
Man065_Man066_0795,we're in the car a lot because I can't
Man065_Man066_0796,drive so you are always driving me crazy
Man065_Man066_0797,and places so but yeah at the phone it's
Man065_Man066_0798,insane
Man065_Man066_0799,you have to just ask for help it's ok
Man065_Man066_0800,what is the secret that you have been
Man065_Man066_0801,too afraid to tell me
Man065_Man066_0802,I don't have any secrets from you
Man065_Man066_0803,I really don't yeah I wouldn't know if
Man065_Man066_0804,you did yeah you wouldn't you can see it
Man065_Man066_0805,in my face like the highest bullshit
Man065_Man066_0806,meter on earth well on top of that like
Man065_Man066_0807,anyway the worst liar I'm the worst
Man065_Man066_0808,I'm the worst liar I also physically
Man065_Man066_0809,what will not eat you'll see me loose
Man065_Man066_0810,like about five to ten pounds and then
Man065_Man066_0811,you'll be like what is going on with you
Man065_Man066_0812,and then I'll come out with no it's more
Man065_Man066_0813,like the shifty eyes and though but it's
Man065_Man066_0814,it's cute that you think that you're
Man065_Man066_0815,doing it effectively every time let's
Man065_Man066_0816,just get to the fact that you're not
Man065_Man066_0817,saying something yeah yeah
Man065_Man066_0818,because before we got married that was a
Man065_Man066_0819,huge part of our relationship right
Man065_Man066_0820,where I was like I need to disclose
Man065_Man066_0821,everything to you because if I'm asking
Man065_Man066_0822,you to make a legal agreement with me
Man065_Man066_0823,it's not fair
Man065_Man066_0824,I mean to some degree there are some
Man065_Man066_0825,things that don't have to be shared if
Man065_Man066_0826,they aren't related to the relationship
Man065_Man066_0827,but things that I thought could have a
Man065_Man066_0828,bearing on the way that you viewed me or
Man065_Man066_0829,how you perceived me absolutely I wanted
Man065_Man066_0830,you to know them I didn't want to trick
Man065_Man066_0831,you into marrying me so when you were
Man065_Man066_0832,like yeah that's fine for all these dark
Man065_Man066_0833,whatever parts of my past it's like what
Man065_Man066_0834,you still want to marry me okay yeah
Man065_Man066_0835,okay it's your chain what's the most fun
Man065_Man066_0836,you've had with me and why
Man065_Man066_0837,[Music]
Man065_Man066_0838,okay like so many fun times
Man065_Man066_0839,I can't isolate it I can't say that this
Man065_Man066_0840,one fun time is the very best of all
Man065_Man066_0841,time but it's pretty fucking awesome
Man065_Man066_0842,when we were in the Adirondacks and we
Man065_Man066_0843,were on the kayak comment that day way
Man065_Man066_0844,out in that lake whatever it was even
Man065_Man066_0845,called and it was all overcast and we
Man065_Man066_0846,were just singing scream singing listen
Man065_Man066_0847,from dream girls and thence and then we
Man065_Man066_0848,were doing colors of the wind
Man065_Man066_0849,surely this is a rare moment it was
Man065_Man066_0850,perfect and then and we just went out
Man065_Man066_0851,into the middle as far as we could and
Man065_Man066_0852,we were like can he hear us so fucking
Man065_Man066_0853,who cares and we just kept going it
Man065_Man066_0854,going and that was so much fun just
Man065_Man066_0855,scream singing at the top of our lungs
Man065_Man066_0856,a Jennifer Hudson moment in the middle
Man065_Man066_0857,of nowhere in New York and kayaks like
Man065_Man066_0858,it was just hilarious to think where we
Man065_Man066_0859,both came from like how the hell did we
Man065_Man066_0860,end up there yeah awesome no cell phone
Man065_Man066_0861,reception like a Twilight Zone the
Man065_Man066_0862,waitress with one hand the people who
Man065_Man066_0863,disappeared who owned the hotel yeah it
Man065_Man066_0864,was a great place when do you think I
Man065_Man066_0865,take you for granted and why I think you
Man065_Man066_0866,take me for granted when I give you
Man065_Man066_0867,really really good advice and it's
Man065_Man066_0868,mainly about being in the present moment
Man065_Man066_0869,and I'm like don't listen to all this
Man065_Man066_0870,other stuff please like take just take
Man065_Man066_0871,it out forget it move on and go forward
Man065_Man066_0872,with your life just stop racking your
Man065_Man066_0873,brain about it listen to me just I want
Man065_Man066_0874,you to be calm and I think that's when I
Man065_Man066_0875,feel most abandoned chef yeah taking
Man065_Man066_0876,advantage well taking her grand am sorry
Man065_Man066_0877,that's fair that's totally fair I'm
Man065_Man066_0878,still working on it
Man065_Man066_0879,it's just hard in the moment anybody
Man065_Man066_0880,could say it to me if you can say those
Man065_Man066_0881,words to me and it still
Man065_Man066_0882,doesn't penetrate then that's like
Man065_Man066_0883,obviously my problem that I need to
Man065_Man066_0884,really work on and so yeah yeah great a
Man065_Man066_0885,thing if you could wish one thing for me
Man065_Man066_0886,what would it be and why you'd have your
Man065_Man066_0887,business your business would be not
Man065_Man066_0888,necessarily like an empire it doesn't
Man065_Man066_0889,have to be an empire something massive
Man065_Man066_0890,but you would definitely have your own
Man065_Man066_0891,store you would definitely on a daily
Man065_Man066_0892,level be using all of your skills and I
Man065_Man066_0893,like on a business perspective
Man065_Man066_0894,interpersonally creatively and you would
Man065_Man066_0895,have purpose in your life that was
Man065_Man066_0896,something you could really be proud of
Man065_Man066_0897,something that you made that's what I
